  <b>Book 1</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>The Dawn of the D.S.F.</b>
</p><p align="justify">Inside the smallest bedroom of a small suburban house on the outskirts of Little Whinging, the quiet and calm evening was disturbed by a storm of clothes and books. As the stars began to shine in the sky and the last lights of day disappeared over the horizon, a dark-haired teenager was rummaging through his meagre possessions. Sitting atop an askew desk covered in newspaper clips and half-written to-do lists was a cage, its bottom littered with feathers and the remains of a rodent, its occupant was enjoying a well-deserved rest, undisturbed by the boy's frantic search.</p><p align="justify">The rest of the room was sparse. The faded wallpaper was not masked by any photos or furniture, except a badly repaired chair and a dishevelled bed, the proof of one too many restless nights. Everything the boy owned could fit in the trunk being unceremoniously emptied and no effort was made to make the room feel like home. Then again, the place this boy considered home was further away than it had ever been at the moment. </p><p align="justify">Sending another book flying in a way that would have scandalized a certain school librarian, he took a shirt out of the trunk. Just as he was about to throw it on the bed with the rest, a high-pitched hoot stopped him in his tracks. Looking up, Harry Potter pushed back his glasses on his nose and found himself facing an offended Owl with a shirt covering a good part of her cage. </p><p align="justify">“Sorry, Hedwig. I just can’t find that damn stone.” He said, pushing on the bed to help himself up.</p><p align="justify">As he removed the shirt from its precarious position, his eyes caught sight of a small parchment note with thin and slanted writings. This letter was both the source of all his problems and the salvation he had waited for all summer. He barely believed it when Hedwig delivered it to him three days ago. Even though he already knew it by heart now, he couldn’t help himself to read it one more time. Dumbledore was going to come and pick him up personally tonight. </p><p align="justify">Finally, after an entire year, he had decided to stop ignoring him and give him some answers. About the war and Voldemort. About what Sirius was doing and why he himself, the greatest wizard of our time, refused to even look him in the eyes for so long. Sure, if the last year taught him something, it’s the necessity of keeping some secrets to yourself but...</p><p align="justify">Harry was dragged out of his musing when the light at the corner of his eyes died suddenly. Staring through the window, he could barely see the street bathed in darkness.</p><p align="justify">“Did the lamp posts just die?” Harry asked, looking at Hedwig for confirmation, only for the bird to look right back at him with her head tilted.</p><p align="justify">Unsure of what was happening, Harry peered once again into the night, trying to discern anything unusual or dangerous. It wouldn’t be the first time an attacker found his way to his relatives’ house. He was about to give up and go back to his search when a tall silhouette in a flowing cape appeared from behind the neighbour’s hedge and made its way toward the house.</p><p align="justify">“Crap. He’s already here.” Harry realized.</p><p align="justify">Harry turned in a hurry, throwing his scattered belongings back into the trunk. Robes, tomes, a bag of crisps, half-finished essays, a strange-looking helmet and other items flew into the room, disturbing the night bird once again. Making sure her displeasure was known, Hedwige hooted loudly and flapped her wings in the confines of her cage. As if remembering the presence of his friend, Harry closed his trunk and took hold of the cage before opening the window. </p><p align="justify">“Sorry girl, I lost track of time. We’re getting out of here. Wait for me at Padfoot’s place alright? I’m sure he’ll have a few treats for you.”</p><p align="justify">He opened the cage’s door and Hedwig gave his hand a last nudge with her head before spreading her wings and taking flight into the night. He stayed there for a moment, his eyes stuck on the white dot getting smaller in the distance, not unlike a moving star in the darkness of space. He stood there, mesmerized, until he heard the doorbell ring. He really should get going. Closing the window, Harry turned and started running.</p><p align="justify">Bolting out of his room as fast as he could, he thanked whatever deity or powers that may be that the locks weren’t closed yet. Harry managed to get to the stairs before he saw Uncle Vernon in a red dressing gown already opening the door. The large man was muttering under his breath about birds and uncivilized hours to disturb good people.</p><p align="justify">The door opened to reveal a tall figure draped in a black travel cape and purple robes. Half-moon spectacles, a white beard cascading down to his waist and an agreeable smile on an impossibly old face left no place for doubt as to the guest’s identity. The headmaster had arrived.</p><p align="justify">“Good evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. Judging by your apparent surprise, Harry did not warn you of my arrival.” Dumbledore said in a pleasant tone. </p><p align="justify">Surprise was a mild way to put it. As he got down the stairs, Harry saw the look on his uncle’s face as he backed away from the door. His eyes were trying to push out of their orbits as all colours drained from his face. His ears quickly began to regain a red tint though, announcing the storm brewing inside that Harry would much prefer to avoid.</p><p align="justify">“But let us pretend that you invited me inside. I fear these troubled times are not suited to enjoy an evening talk on the porch.“</p><p align="justify">With a quickness betraying his age, Dumbledore stepped inside the house and closed the door behind him. Doing so allowed him to notice Harry and a smile grew on his face as he looked him straight in the eyes.</p><p align="justify">“Ah, good evening Harry. I hope you had a good summer.”</p><p align="justify">The arrival of his nephew managed to prompt Vernon back from his horrified trance, cutting short any answer Harry could have given. The large man stood a little straighter as he gritted his teeth and menacingly brought an index up to Dumbledore’s face.</p><p align="justify">“Now listen here, <em>Mister</em>. I don’t want to be rude but-” He began to talk in a tone devoid of all civility.</p><p align="justify">“Unfortunately, accidental lapses in politeness happen more often than we’d like.” Dumbledore briskly interrupted. “Ah, and this must be Petunia.”</p><p align="justify">The sound of the kitchen’s door opening betrayed Aunt Petunia as she appeared in the doorway, still wearing rubber gloves and a dressing gown put on in haste atop her nightgown. Her horse-like face was distorted in an awkward mix of shock and distaste at the sight of the unwelcome guest.</p><p align="justify">“Albus Dumbledore, we know each other by correspondence.” The headmaster said while lightly raising his hat from his head. Quite a way to call a letter with an abandoned baby and thousands of others exploding all over her living room. “May I say that your African lilies are quite gorgeous. I must admit, I never managed to grow anything myself.” He added in a playful tone.</p><p align="justify">“Now, I know my coming this late into your home unannounced must be a burden and I am sure we all have pressing matters to attend to. That is why we will not be taking any more of your time than necessary.” continued Dumbledore, as if talking to friendly acquaintances around a cup of tea. “If Harry can show me to his room, we will gather his belongings and be on our way.” He added, turning to face Harry and motioning him to lead the way.</p><p align="justify">Not wanting to wait for his uncle to explode, Harry nodded and quickly climbed back upstairs. He heard Dumbledore excuse himself and follow after him as he reached the first floor. Down the hall, from behind his half-opened door, Dudley was watching him with a quizzical look. He seemed about to ask him something as Harry continued toward his room, when his expression turned to surprise and fear. His eyes had moved to watch something behind Harry, no doubt catching sight of Dumbledore, but soon disappeared as he closed the door in a hurry. One less awkward goodbye to worry about, he supposed.</p><p align="justify">He got back into his room and started piling up his trunk, cage and boom. As he turned to bring them to the hallway, he found Dumbledore, smiling calmly at him while small butterflies of lights of vibrant colours flew away behind him. The numerous locks usually pending on the side of the doorframe were nowhere to be found.</p><p align="justify">“Are all your affairs in order?” Dumbledore asked as he let his gaze wander in the small and impersonal room.</p><p align="justify">“Almost. There’s still one thing I can’t find. A white stone. It’s ... important to me.” Harry was sure his hesitation to say too much about it was painted all over his face. There was a reason he never played poker with Seamus since third year.</p><p align="justify">Chuckling softly as if he had caught a grandchild causing mischief red-handed, Dumbledore took out his wand in a swift motion. A rounded triangular rock flew from behind the desk at high-speed, only to slow down and gently stop itself in the headmaster’s other hand. As Dumbledore put away his wand in a pocket, Harry noticed that what little he could see of his right hand underneath the ample sleeve of his robe was nauseating. The fingers were shrivelled and the skin had turned a sickly black, making it look like a dying spider.</p><p align="justify">“Sir, what happened to your...” Harry began to ask, concerned.</p><p align="justify">“Ah, it is certainly an interesting story, but one that is best left for later. I would not want to spoil it by telling it before you understand everything. Do not worry, however, as you will have your answer sooner than you think.” Dumbledore said with a soft yet sad smile as he extended his good hand, the stone within it. “Was that all?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, thank you, sir.” Harry said, taking back the stone and attaching it to his chest. He made sure to power it off quickly before any sound or chatter escaped from it. </p><p align="justify">“Then I believe we are all set to go. We best not tarry here. There are a few things we need to do before I leave you in the eager care of your godfather.” And with a tap of his wand, the trunk, cage and broom glowed brightly for an instant before shrinking and wrapping on themselves in a mad whirl before disappearing. </p><p align="justify">They got out of the house quickly after that. His aunt and uncle did not bother to see them off, preferring to stay in the living room with the TV’s sound as loud as they could without inconveniencing the neighbours. Even Dumbledore did not mention them as they stepped outside. They walked up to the street without sparing even a glance toward the house. When they stopped on the sidewalk, Harry took the arm Dumbledore offered and with the sensation of being squeezed through a straw, they were gone. Leaving behind them the perfectly normal and orderly Privet Drive and its suffocating heat.</p><hr /><p align="justify">They appeared in a park, somewhere in London. A few green hills, dotted with trees and bushes, were separated by a dirt path. The place appeared deserted and, after making sure Harry was alright, Dumbledore started to walk at a leisurely pace along the path, motioning him to come along. They walked like this for a few minutes, in complete silence. </p><p align="justify">Harry did not know what to say or even why they were there. He’d known Dumbledore wanted his help with something before dropping him at Grimmauld Place, but there wasn’t anything or anyone here. He would also be hard-pressed to admit it, but he was feeling nervous. This was the first time he’d had a real conversation with Dumbledore without it being the result of his daily misadventures and it was off to a bad start ... Or not starting to be exact. He’d had a few hopes while they were still at his relatives’ but now ... was he ignoring him again? </p><p align="justify">“While I do enjoy a little walk at night, I think we could do with a little break.” Dumbledore said, interrupting his ruminations. Harry lifted his head, looking at his headmaster for the first time since they’d left the house. His bearings held a sombre note to them as he appeared to think about something far away, contradicting his tone as he sat down on a bench, right under a lamppost. Still filled with apprehension, Harry sat down next to Dumbledore, only to find himself face-to-face with a popsicle.</p><p align="justify">“Ice pop? I find them to be a delightful remedy to the heat in this season. And I finally managed to convince the castle’s elves to learn the recipe.” Dumbledore’s musing expression had disappeared behind his usual mirthful demeanour as he took out another popsicle from pockets too small to be normal. </p><p align="justify">“Eeer ... Yes, thank you, Sir.” Harry said, a bit unsettled by the sudden offer.</p><p align="justify">As they began to eat, Harry felt some of his nervousness fade away. Yes, he was with Albus Dumbledore out on some errand, maybe even to help for the war, but he was also with his headmaster. The whimsical headmaster that helped him, protected him and comforted him as best he could through the years and their pitfalls. The man had dedicated his life to fighting injustice and helping children grow.</p><p align="justify">“I know I disappointed you, Harry. That I let you down more than once since we first met. And even more so during the last year. And it pained me greatly each time I failed to help you and each time I had to lie and hide things from you.” Dumbledore said with the same sad expression he had earlier. “Fortunately for both of us, our circumstances have changed and now, those times come to an end.”</p><p align="justify">“Does that mean you’ll finally tell me about what’s going on? About the war and Voldemort?” Harry asked, his excitement leaking into his voice.</p><p align="justify">“In part. Many years ago, you asked me why Voldemort had gone after your parents that fateful night. Why he came back to haunt us all, and you more than others.” As soon as the words left Dumbledore's lips, the air seemed to turn as cold as the ice in his hand. Harry shivered as he clenched his fist hard. ”It is time that you learned some things. Knowledge that would have disastrous consequences should it fall into the wrong hands. That is the reason why I avoided you. It pained me greatly to push you away like that and to leave you in the dark, but the risk was too great.”</p><p align="justify">“The risk? I don't have the habit of chatting with death eaters over tea, sir. And neither Ron nor Hermione would let it slip.” Harry said, slightly raising his voice in incredulity.</p><p align="justify">“Far be it from me to doubt your or your friends’ ability to keep a secret. I was afraid that you would not have a choice in the matter.” Dumbledore stayed calm in his answer and turned to face his student, leaving his ice cream forgotten in his hand. “There is ... a connection between you and Lord Voldemort. One I am unable to sever and of which I only have suppositions about its origins. You may remember dreams you had, flashes of emotions, of thoughts not your own these last few years. I suspect it is why you also share some gifts Tom also possessed.”</p><p align="justify">He was connected to Voldemort? That’s why he’d had those dreams of what he was doing years ago and why he was able to talk to snakes? That was ... alarming. Especially since he now had secrets he had to keep from Voldemort at any cost. “So that’s why ... But how? And why me? Can he see what I do?” Harry asked. While the vivid nightmares of the last few years had completely disappeared, he still had bad dreams from time to time. Most of them he could not remember, and the rest were just vague ideas of places or feelings.</p><p align="justify">But it's not like he had them all the time. They only came back during the holidays.</p><p align="justify">...When he spent a lot of time on Earth.</p><p align="justify">Oh. </p><p align="justify">“I ... I feared that Voldemort would have been able to peek into your mind, searching for every little bit of knowledge that could have helped him. Or worse, pierce through it to get what he wanted from me, hurting you in the process. That is why I had to keep my distance from you.” Dumbledore said in a mournful voice. His expression was grave and he seemed subdued for a moment. </p><p align="justify">”However, this past year, you have shown great restraint and serenity in the face of attacks from a vilifying press, a hostile ministry and a student body that turned its back on you. While my hands were tied and I was unable to protect you as I would have liked, you proved that the connection was too weak for Voldemort to exploit it and that you were strong enough to resist him. Unless you had other dreams you forgot to tell me about?” He added, tilting his head to the side and peering at Harry from above his glasses.</p><p align="justify">“No, nothing like that. I think it’s because I found ... a way to have some sort of peace. And you don’t have to apologize for Fudge’s vendetta. You were also targeted and I’ve grown used to everyone thinking I’m a liar up to no good. It doesn’t bother me anymore.” Harry said. And it was true. Mostly. Although it had eaten him up for a while, the time he spent with his friends working for something that mattered helped him realise that there were bigger issues than school popularity. It still stung, but it didn't bother him as much as before. “But I still don’t understand. Why me? Why not try to get to you directly?”</p><p align="justify">“Because fate and men work hand in hand sometimes. As one shapes the other, the reverse is also true. Shortly before your birth, a prophecy was made. While I know it in whole, Voldemort only ever heard part of it.” Dumbledore explained. “He feared what would happen if the prophecy worked to come to pass and tried to prevent it. Unfortunately for us all, his reckless and horrifying actions led to the prophecy being set in motion in the first place. That night, both your fates became linked, creating this connection against his will.”</p><p align="justify">As the headmaster answered his question and recited the prophecy, Harry felt his blood turn cold. Because of Voldemort, his fate had been sealed before he was even born. He would have to fight the greatest dark lord of his time or die trying because the madman killed his parents and failed to finish the job...</p><p align="justify">Well let him come then. He’d already known he’d have to fight in this war. He had been fighting it since he was eleven. And he was pretty optimistic about his chances now that he had the Requirement and his crew backing him up. He’d have to make plans for them in case he did not make it though ... See Hermione? I can plan for different scenarios myself now.</p><p align="justify">“Thank you for telling me, sir. At least now I understand what’s going on ... And what I will have to do for all of this to end.” Harry affirmed, trying to look more confident than he felt. </p><p align="justify">“I must admit that you are taking all this news better than I thought you would. Do not focus on the prophecy too much, however. It was Tom's failure to understand that fate is not as set in stone as some may like to think that pushed his actions that night. It only holds as much power on us as we let it.” Dumbledore said, his mood clearly lifting up as a soft smile appeared on his lips.</p><p align="justify">Not knowing how to respond to something like that, Harry only nodded. Existential questions were really not his thing.</p><p align="justify">“But let us not tarry on unpleasant subjects.” Dumbledore continued. “Though it is linked to what we talked about until now. I would like to give you private lessons this year.”</p><p align="justify">“Private lessons ... with you?” Harry asked after the surprise of the unexpected offer pulled him out of his silence. </p><p align="justify">“Unless there is another me around, in which case I would very much like to meet him. If you agree, I think it is time I take a greater part in your education.” Dumbledore said with a small laugh. “Especially since it would seem that you will have a lot more free time from now on.” He added, raising an eyebrow while looking at him.</p><p align="justify">“Of course, I’d love to,” Harry answered. ”and I know that my O.W.Ls were very weak, but I think I found something I want to do that doesn’t need them. For now, I’m trying to do what I can to help out with the war.” He added, more confident in his choice than he had been about anything else these last few years.</p><p align="justify">"Ah yes, the clothes you and your friends gave to the order. Quite a marvelous work I must say, even though I was incapable of working out how they were made. I will admit that I am quite intrigued as to how you managed to enchant them." Dumbledore inquired. </p><p align="justify">"I'd rather not say, sir. You and the order have your secrets and we have ours. It's best that that kind of information does go around." Harry said, squirming a bit in his seat and hoping the headmaster would not press on. He understood the necessity of keeping some things as secret as possible, but that didn’t mean he liked it.</p><p align="justify">“We all have our little secrets that we can keep. As long as they aren’t dangerous to keep. Still, do not let this war consume you to the point where you have nothing else. I would hate to see such a brilliant young man squander his future because of the mistakes of his elders.” Dumbledore said, an air of seriousness returning for a brief moment before a wide smile appeared once again on his face as he looked at the stars.</p><p align="justify">“Well, would you look at the time! You’ve spent long enough listening to the ramblings of an old man, Harry. Although I will still need your help one last time before I leave you with your godfather...” </p><hr /><p align="justify">The soft clink of his soles on metal was his only companion as Harry walked through the empty, but brightly lit corridors of the <em> Requirement</em>. His body felt heavy and just keeping his eyes open took great effort after a long day of travel and festivities. </p><p align="justify">Unlike the last five years, the long and sometimes tortuous climb of the castle to reach the seventh floor was only the beginning of the journey. It had been more than half a year since he’d even seen the Gryffindor dormitory. Today though, he was walking the path toward the large room they’d repurposed into a common dormitory and that had become quite familiar since he’d changed residence.</p><p align="justify">After a long ride on the Express reuniting with friends, it was nice to have a bit of time to himself to think things through. They’d agreed to meet in the late morning, letting everyone meet up with friends and rest after the trip.</p><p align="justify">Although most of his summer had been dreadfully long and boring, the last week had gone by in a flash. Dumbledore had picked him up at the Dursleys and asked for his help to get an old potion professor out of retirement. He’d then left him with Sirus to spend some time with him. The poor man was growing even more restless, locked up as he was in his parents’ house. As if he traded one prison for another. They’d avoided Diagon Alley, leaving Mrs. Weasley in charge of shopping for their school supplies.</p><p align="justify">She’d told them afterwards that the alley was emptier than it usually was at this time of the year. They had the same impression when they realized that more than a few muggle-born students were missing at the sorting feast. It seemed that the Creeves were not the only family to leave the country because of the tightening regulations against them...</p><p align="justify">Lost in his thoughts, Harry stopped midway in the corridor, in front of a large oval door, and pushed a bulky button on the wall by rote. The door slid open, only for Harry to find himself facing large crates, piled up on top of each other and filling up the room. Looking left and right and confirming that he was indeed on the right level and in the right hallway, he brought his hand to the communication stone on his chest.</p><p align="justify">“Could someone tell me <em> why </em>we don’t have a place to sleep anymore? The dormitory is a bit full right now, and I don’t feel like going outside to sleep under the stars tonight.” Harry asked in a perfectly deadpan voice.</p><p align="justify">The voice of Angelina Johnson came out of the stone, with such clarity that you’d think she was here with him. “What? The great captain is scared that he wouldn’t find his way back?”</p><p align="justify">“Knowing his luck, he’d end up floating away before reappearing two months later, sporting a beard and riding a dragon.” Ron’s voice added.</p><p align="justify">“Would the dragon be able to fly in space? Wouldn't it need to breathe? Maybe we could make it a big spacesuit?” Luna mumbled, clearly half-asleep.</p><p align="justify">“Quiet you lot. It’s too late to tell jokes on this channel.” Terry Boot chastised.</p><p align="justify">“Wait, no one warned the captain about the rooms? I thought Ernie was taking care of it?” Anthony asked, paying no mind to his housemate’s remark.</p><p align="justify">As if summoned by the mention of his name, an out-of-breath youth wearing a black suit with yellow light plating arrived in the hallway. His short blond hair was in disarray, and a few strands were stuck to his face by sweat as he struggled to breathe.</p><p align="justify">“Sorry, sorry ... Got lost in the lower levels ... It’s been a while.” Ernie said as he ran up to Harry.</p><p align="justify">“He just arrived. Thanks, everyone, and good night.” Harry said and gave a tap on his stone to cut the communication, leaving his friends to their banter. He was too tired to take part in it, but he will have to remind himself to get back at Ron. “Breathe Ernie. You could have just given me a call. No need to run yourself ragged ... literally.”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t worry ... Just ... Just give me a second... I wanted to..." Ernie tried to say, before taking a moment to get his breath back. "Sorry. I wanted to bring you up to speed on the latest discoveries before the first meeting of the year. First thing: we found rooms better suited for lodging. This way, Captain.” With that, Ernie started walking back the way he came, Harry hot on his heels.</p><p align="justify">“Angelina’s team found out how to access a map of the ship yesterday. We've estimated that we currently occupy just shy of eight percent of the available space for our own needs. The rest of the rooms are used as storage for the conjurator’s base materials.” Ernie began to explain while fiddling with a small slate in his hands. After finding what he was searching for, he handed it to Harry. “Here, take a look. We also found these nifty little things. They’re like portable consoles. They’re dead useful.”</p><p align="justify">On the slate was a screen with various markings in ancient runes that currently displayed what looked like a map. “That’s what the ship looks like? It’s even bigger than we thought. How do you use this thing again?” Harry gave the slate back to Ernie. He’d seen quite a few of the consoles around the ship, but you had to use the communication stones on a pedestal to interact with them.</p><p align="justify">“You touch the part you want to access. Terry is having a field day with it, trying all sorts of stuff to see what they can do. He’ll show you what he found later and give you one.” Ernie replied. “Now, when Hanna saw the plan, she decided to look for better rooms for everyone. To give us all some privacy you know. Everyone has been assigned to smaller rooms in groups of two or three, except you and the division chiefs. You got the VIP treatment  and get to have a whole room for yourself.”</p><p align="justify">“Yay. No more sleepless nights because of Ron’s snoring.” Harry said in a half-enthusiastic tone. Having some calm and privacy would be great, but after years in the Gryffindor dorm and the one on the ship, he’d grown used to sleeping amongst friends.</p><p align="justify">As they walked, they passed by a large window giving them a great view of Neptune. According to Marietta, the blue planet was relatively small compared to the others in the system. Still, it seemed downright gigantic at this distance and offered a breathtaking view that he hoped he would never get bored with. Orbiting around it was a structure that lit up from time to time as its final sections were being completed.</p><p align="justify">“How much time before the station is completed?” He asked Ernie who hadn’t even noticed the window and continued to walk with his eyes fixed on the slate.</p><p align="justify">“A week. Two tops depending on our use of the conjurator now that everyone’s back. Once it’s finished, we’ll transfer a lot of our material stock over to it so most conjuration will be done on board.” Ernie explained as they walked down one of the spiralling slopes toward the third level. The aliens who built this ship did not appear to be quite fond of stairs. ”That’ll free up some of the rooms for other stuff. I know Tony and Neville plan on making a greenhouse or something close to it somewhere.”</p><p align="justify">“Of course. Merlin forbade Neville to try and <em> not </em> breed a monstrous plant that’ll try to take over the ship and eat us all.” Harry joked. He had approved the idea when Neville had come to him, explaining the necessity of growing their own magical ingredients. With how things were going down there, they might soon need to be completely independent to procure their resources. And since the conjurator could not replicate anything magical, they will have to set up plantations and maybe even a ranch. Of course, they’d also need a potion lab... Maybe they could use the ship’s bathrooms? </p><p align="justify">“Please, don’t give him ideas. I have nightmares about the time I had to clean up Sprout’s personal greenhouse during detention last year.” Ernie said, repressing a shiver down his back. “Anyway, we’re here.” He added, stopping in front of an arched door wide enough for two people to enter side by side.</p><p align="justify">A push of a button revealed a wide room shaped in a half-circle. The walls were covered by of some sort of thin and tall dark red panels, and a large Gryffindor banner had been put up on the left one. On the right side, a large window with two armchairs and a low table in front of it gave a view of both deep space and the port flank of the ship.</p><p align="justify">Like in the other rooms of <em>Requirement</em>, most of the furniture had been conjured using Hogwarts’ as templates. He wasn’t surprised to find a replica of his four-poster bed against the left wall, facing the window. Against the far wall, a wooden desk with piles of what he assumed were “extra-credit assignments” on top of it, was waiting for him. One of his Gryffindor roommates must have brought his stuff in because his trunk and broom had been left to rest against the desk.</p><p align="justify">“Padma took care of the decoration. I guess she didn’t want you to feel homesick?” Ernie said, not making any effort to hide the wide smile currently on his face as he caught Harry’s eyes wide open in wonder. “I’ll leave you to sleep. Welcome back, Captain.”</p><p align="justify">After they wished each other good night and Ernie left, it wasn’t long before Harry found himself crashing on his bed in his pyjamas. His eyes closed as the fatigue of the last few months finally began to melt away.</p><p align="justify">It was good to be home.</p><p> </p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="justify">Harry’s life on the ship resumed as if it had never stopped for one more boring summer. He was back to reading reports and suggestions, making plans and stopping overzealous crew members from pulling consecutive all-nighters and suicidal stunts. The only difference was currently in his hands as he walked down one of the lengthy corridors toward the engineering section.</p><p align="justify">This thing had obviously been designed by a mad alien to be as hard to operate as possible. Why couldn’t there be big buttons labelled with what they did? Buttons were great. But no, everything had to be made of cryptic symbols and arranging them in certain patterns or even moving around a command stone above it. The fact that the entire bloody thing was written in runes he still didn’t understand did nothing to endear the device to him, no matter how many times Hermione and the others sang its praises.</p><p align="justify">Through a combination of trials and errors and of foggy recollections of the few runic words he’d managed to memorise over the summer, he finally found what he was looking for. The long strings of text and atomic diagrams describing their reserves of raw materials, compiled by Lavender, appeared on the screen.</p><p align="justify">The feeling of victory was quickly squashed as Harry realised the list itself was written in runes. So much for trying to look things up himself. He really hoped Terry read through all those computer science books he brought back quickly so he could start on the translation program he mentioned last week. Or at least make it so they could write with proper letters. At this point, he’d settle for centaur pictograms.</p><p align="justify">Anything would be better than runes.</p><p align="justify">At least the translation team continued to go through the ship, one room and console at a time, sticking notes and translations on all of the unknown consoles and labs they’d found. They already discovered a lot about the ship, but they’d barely scratched the surface and he’d prefer if they didn’t push the “eject all the air” button by accident.</p><p align="justify">As he closed the infuriating list and tried to display the ship’s energy consumption, he made a mental note, for the third time that week, that he needed to find someone to look into the ship’s weapons. They had recently found out it had some, but they didn’t know what they did and how they worked. They most likely won’t be able to use such heavy weaponry in the war without racking up some serious trouble, but they would at least know how to defend themselves if need be.</p><p align="justify">Still focused on the slate, his trek through the ship almost came to an abrupt end when he almost ran into a door head first. The main storeroom, finally. He was almost tempted to use his hoverboard to move around the ship faster, but he had to ban their use in the corridors last year because of too many collisions between distracted crew members. He pressed the door’s control panel absent-mindedly.</p><p align="justify">“Lavender, I need some-”</p><p align="justify">He stopped mid-sentence however, as he discovered that the room he’d stepped in was not the main store room but a communal bedroom filled with wooden furniture, hammocks, board games and a half-finished hand of explosive snap still sending a few sparks every now and then. As they took to spend more time on the ship than in Hogwarts, a good part of the crew had followed their captain’s lead and permanently moved in. The new quarters were filling up by the weeks and Harry was starting to worry the heads of house would notice how empty their dorms really were.</p><p align="justify">“Great. Now how do I open the map on this thing?”</p><hr /><p align="justify">Later that week, in the late hours of the night, Harry arrived at the observation deck they had turned into a mess and relaxation area to find it almost deserter. Only Parvati and Alicia were finishing dinner in a corner as they talked in hushed voices. Harry saluted them with a node before making his way toward his prize: the local console controlling the conjurator. After a good training session with Ron’s team and a long evening spent working through yet another pile of reports, the only thing on his mind was a good plate of bangers and mash and a big slice of treacle tart.</p><p align="justify">Sometimes he wonders how the crew found time to do any work with the amount of reports and ideas they sent him.</p><p align="justify">Taking up his tray after conjuring the steaming meal on it, Harry turned around only to stop in his tracks. Justin Finch-Fletchley, the very last person he wished to see after Malfoy and Voldemort himself, was coming up to him looking way too pleased with himself. In his arms, several parchment rolls and ingots of different metals told him his “Head negotiator” was coming back from his latest foray into Goblin territory.</p><p align="justify">Harry cursed under his breath and desperately looked toward the girls in the corner, in search of support to excuse himself from the grinning Justin. He found them leaving the room at a rushed pace. Parvati turned around just before going through the door to mouth the word ‘sorry’ before disappearing.</p><p align="justify">Traitors.</p><p align="justify">“Ah, Captain, you’re here. I’ve been looking all over for you. I just came back from Gringotts and I think you’ll like my report.”</p><p align="justify">With a sigh, Harry sat down heavily at the nearest table, putting down his tray. It seemed like he wouldn’t escape this tonight.</p><p align="justify">”Why yes Justin, go on. It’s not like I was planning on enjoying a peaceful evening here.”</p><p align="justify">“Perfect. I’ll get right to it then.”</p><p align="justify">Completely oblivious to sarcasm as usual, then. He held hope that he would break through to him, one day.</p><p align="justify"> “We’ve come a long way and established the basis for our future dealings with them. I‘ve started drafting a contract to make sure everything is clearly laid out. Not that it would be legally binding, what with the Ministry not knowing about us or being very friendly toward you, but-"</p><p align="justify">Merlin, did he love to hear himself talk.</p><p align="justify">A few weeks ago, Justin had been appalled to hear the reports on the first few meetings with Gringotts. He had tracked down Lee and Hermione to explain in excruciating detail everything they had done wrong and why they should not have been the ones to handle it to begin with. As he seemed unable to take a hint and his incessant tirade did not seem to end, those two had the brilliant idea to get rid of the annoying distraction by sending him to voice his complaints directly to Harry.</p><p align="justify">He hadn’t had the time to decide how but one thing was certain: they would both pay for this.</p><p align="justify">Maybe scrubbing the ship’s hull by hand? That could work...</p><p align="justify">That day, Justin had almost bored him to death with an uninterruptible rant on proper negotiation methods for almost <em>three hours </em>, ignoring all his less-than-subtle hints to stop. He’d announced he would be the one taking care of all their ‘public and foreign relations problems’. Apparently, Lee and Hermione might be able to run the numbers but they were definitely not fit to take care of such important matters. He also doubted that they even knew about Goblin society and customs they would need to respect if they wanted to make this a long-term agreement.<br /><br />Desperate for a way out of this infernal monologue, Harry had yielded completely. He’d named Justin “Fleet Diplomat” or some other rot he’d come up with on the spot before running away. Later, he wondered if he had made a mistake in his haste to get away. Talking it out with Ron as they trained had led him to the conclusion that it didn’t matter in the end.</p><p align="justify">At this point, they had the greedy little buggers onboard with the deal hook, line and sinker. Now that they knew what they had to win in this, they wouldn’t pass on the opportunity. This deal would serve as a test to see if Justin was as half as good as he seemed to think he was. It’s not like they had anything to lose, what with their virtually limitless resources.</p><p align="justify">Oh right. This whole thing was supposed to be a test. Might be a good idea to actually listen and look like he cared about it.</p><p align="justify">”-will want to keep the deal going for as long as possible, so they most likely won’t turn on us. We can trust the merchant caste as they have everything to win in this and we have the interest of the artisans. The only uncertainty is the reaction of the noble caste. They haven’t taken a stance on the deal yet but since we threaten their monopoly while bringing a virtually infinite supply of rare items, we can’t be sure of anything. They requested some more samples for testing so I will need more credits for the Conjurator.”</p><p align="justify">See? No risk. Still, this was undeniably a good start as they weren’t likely to get thrown out of the bank. He had no idea where or why Justin even learned any of this stuff but he supposed it didn’t matter.</p><p align="justify">“Granted. I’ll see with Lavender to get you a stone with unlimited credit. Don’t lose it.” Harry said, making a mental note to take care of it before crashing down tonight. “You can give the Goblins everything they want, as long as it keeps them from helping Voldemort’s side.”</p><p align="justify">Justin made no effort to mask the grimace he made when he heard the name but gave no comment on it. Some in the crew were still dubious of his story about the dark lord’s return but figured putting up with his “eccentricity” was a small price to pay to stay on the ship.</p><p align="justify">“For now, it seems like the best we can do. I broached the subject but they strictly refuse to interfere with their other clients. Though they shouldn’t do anything that might jeopardise the deal so they won’t work against us at least. With time, I might be able to get some more leeway with them though.”</p><p align="justify">"Do what you can."</p><p align="justify">With that, Justin began to pack up the parchments he had laid out on the table to illustrate his presentation. Just as he was ready to leave, however, Harry called back to him.</p><p align="justify">“Oh and Justin?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes?”</p><p align="justify">“Next time, just write out your report and send it to me, please. Like everyone else.” Harry said, taking a bite out of his tart as he walked away.</p><hr /><p align="justify">During yet another late night, when most of the crew had already gone to sleep, a single figure sat on the bridge. Comfortably installed on a padded chair, the girl clad in a black and yellow suit was reading the various parchments and slates she had spread out on the largest console.</p><p align="justify">Around her, an assortment of pedestal-shaped consoles faced the set of large windows arching across half of the room. Stools and chairs had been placed in front of the consoles and a great fluffy carpet with sitting pillows thrown around on top of it had been set up in front of the windows.</p><p align="justify">The adult members of the crew, if he could call those particular seventeen-year-old that, had made a few discoveries about the ship during summer break. The most notable was the giant screen on the far wall of the bridge, opposite to the windows. They had then found several “wall screens” such as this throughout the ship, mostly in laboratories.</p><p align="justify">They could be used to display pretty much anything they wanted, from the content of the database to the ship’s sensors’ feeds. Right now it was showing a map of the Requirement, annotated with numerous writings in runes giving information on the status of the ship’s various systems.</p><p align="justify">When she heard the soft sound of the door opening, she briefly looked up from her work to send a teasing smile at the newcomer.</p><p align="justify">“Admiral on the bridge! Do I need to salute when you enter a room now?”</p><p align="justify">Harry let out a groan and sent her a tired look as he let himself fall heavily on a nearby stool.</p><p align="justify">“Please not you too, Hannah. I’ve had enough of that with the twins already.”</p><p align="justify">“All right, all right. But you’ll have to get used to it at one point."</p><p align="justify">“Remind me again <em> why </em>I let Katie talk me into making this whole military-like hierarchy thing again?”</p><p align="justify">“Because while everyone in the DA respects you enough to follow your orders, the adults we recruit might object if we don’t make it clear you’re the one in charge. And it would become more complicated to just call you “Captain” if we ever manage to have more than one ship.” She explained patiently, not looking up from the job application she was reading.</p><p align="justify">“Merlin forbid this whole thing stays between us... Hermione and Lee seem determined to turn this into a whole fleet. Still no news of the Creevy?”</p><p align="justify">Colin and Denis had been pulled from Hogwarts after the end of term this summer. They’d told their parents about Voldemort and the growing anti-Muggleborn stance of the Ministry. What the brothers hadn’t expected was their decision to move to America to protect them. It hadn’t stopped them from being part of the crew though.</p><p align="justify">“Not yet. I’ve been going through some of the applications sent by Clarissa in the meantime.”</p><p align="justify">“Ms. Edgecombe, right? She’s been helping out with the recruitment?”</p><p align="justify">That did prompt Hannah to look up from her work and raise an eyebrow at him.</p><p align="justify">“Well, someone had the bright idea of imposing a screening process with draconian background checks. With the Muggle-borns getting fired left and right, we’re getting more people answering the recruitment ad each day. And it’s not like managing the shop takes her much time anyway since we’re barely doing any sales.”</p><p align="justify">Harry knew that, out of the entire crew, he was asking the most out of her. Especially since she and Ms. Edgecombe were doing the work of a much bigger team until they could get the first recruits to help. He did what he could to assist her when he had the time but that was precisely what he sorely lacked lately. The dark circles beneath her eyes mirroring his own told him she did too.</p><p align="justify">He ran a hand through his hair in frustration as he sank a bit more on the stool’s padding.</p><p align="justify">“I know it’s a lot. But we have to be careful. This ship is possibly the greatest discovery ever made in human history. The Ministry is already filled to the brim with Death Eaters and sympathisers by now, and they’re already snooping around the shop. Imagine what they could do if they got in and took over the ship.”</p><p align="justify">"Sounds a bit paranoid. I know we have to stay secret but not everyone is out to get us."</p><p align="justify">"Maybe not but... You remember the defence professor, two years ago?"</p><p align="justify">"Creepy Moody? I still have nightmares of his eye." Her hand stilled for a moment, as a cold shiver went down her spine, before moving again to continue her work.</p><p align="justify">"Turned out he wasn't the real Mad eye Moody after all. A Death Eater kidnapped him and took his place before he even came to Hogwarts. We didn't find out until after he managed to set up my kidnapping during the third task. The real Moody spent the year in a trunk."</p><p align="justify">Hannah’s quill stilled once more and even in the faint light, Harry could see the blood drain from her face.</p><p align="justify">“That’s...”</p><p align="justify">She opened and closed her mouth several times, but her words kept failing her. It took a moment before she could gather herself and colours returned to her.</p><p align="justify">"Alright... I’ll do what I can.”</p><p align="justify">“...Thanks, Hannah.”</p><p align="justify">Well done Harry. Got an O in your “How to kill the mood” class? Not everyone is used to murderers in disguise living next to them for months.</p><p align="justify">They sat there awkwardly for a while, the silence only broken by the grating of a quill on parchment as Hannah continued her work.</p><p align="justify">After a while, Harry couldn’t take the heavy atmosphere anymore. He looked up behind him to the two round muggle clocks displaying different times had been hung on the wall, just above the main console. Above each of them, the words “London” and “Salem” had been written in black.</p><p align="justify">“Still, they’re quite late... Should we call them?”</p><p align="justify">The change of subject seemed to do the trick as Hannah’s tense posture relaxed and she looked at him like an older sister would their younger sibling with their hand in the cookie jar.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sure they’re just busy. They haven’t found a way to leave Ilvermorny yet so they still have to be careful when they want to call. They can’t huddle in a toilet stall every time.”</p><p align="justify">The two brothers had been tasked with finding a place where they could open another shop. Once Hannah recruited and trained some new members, one of them would be sent overseas to help out and sign for everything.</p><p align="justify">Even though he felt a bit guilty about it, Harry was honestly relieved the two brothers would be away for a while. As much as he had come to like Colin over the years, he hadn’t got to know Denis outside of the DA.</p><p align="justify">While he was relieved they got out of the country before the war blew up, Harry was glad they wouldn’t be sneaking around taking pictures anymore. Sure, Colin had toned it down with the years and Dennis had never been as bad as his brother was at his age but they'd never really stopped.</p><p align="justify">“Merlin, I hope so.” He muttered under his breath. “What have you been working on lately?” Harry asked.</p><p align="justify">“Aside from these? Madam Pomfrey agreed to teach Susan and Dean about healing when she isn’t too busy. I gave them a room in the lower section to turn into the potion lab and infirmary they wanted. They should start setting up everything tomorrow.”</p><p align="justify">“Good. I can’t imagine she’d be happy if we continued to show up with burns and wounds we can’t explain.”</p><p align="justify">The idea had come after one too many accidents last year while testing modifications for the suits. There was no trained healer on board and those who graduated couldn’t just go to the infirmary anymore. Like so many other things lately, they needed to learn how to do it themselves.</p><p align="justify">“I also started compiling a lot of what we’ve learned in a manual for the future hires. Paired with Angelina’s growing runic dictionary, it should-” Hannah continued before getting interrupted by an overly excited voice coming out of the command stone she used as a paperweight.</p><p align="justify">“Hey guys! You’ll never believe what we found under a toilet seat!”</p><p align="justify">As it turned out, Hogwarts was not the only magical school filled with secret passages.</p><hr /><p align="justify">Harry was bored out of his mind.</p><p align="justify">The scant rays of light passing between the thick black curtains kept the classroom in a depressing gloom. Harry was not really paying attention as Snape was droning on once more, explaining in excruciating detail the principle behind non-vocal casting. Again. For the third time in the last hour. </p><p align="justify">He briefly wondered if taking Potions with Slughorn instead would have been a better experience. At least he could have tried to win the luck elixir he’d heard about... Not that he was good enough a potionner to win in the first place. From what he’d heard, a Slytherin had pocketed it. Some things never changed.</p><p align="justify">His first lesson with Dumbledore had come and gone on the first week-end after they got back to the castle. Though he still wasn’t sure as to why they needed to see memories of Voldemort and his family, he had to admit there was something bothering him about what he saw. Like he was missing something important, something he should know, but try as he might, he couldn’t figure out what bothered him so...</p><p align="justify">After a week, the only things coming to mind when he thought back to those memories were a <em> really </em>creepy eleven-year-old Tom Riddle and a Dumbledore with the delicacy of Hagrid in a potion shop. He had not spent two sleepless nights thinking of the similarities between Riddle and him, thank you very much.</p><p align="justify">Even discussing what he saw with Ron and Hermione did not help. His attempts to retell the content of the memories of another person only managed to confuse him further. He’d at least found the time to share everything with them. Like the prophecy.</p><p align="justify">Ron had been both relieved and furious after discovering what Mr. Weasley had been guarding when he was attacked. Mr. Weasley was frozen between life and death, without any prospect of recovery, not to protect a weapon, but a sketchy prophecy made by none other than Trelawney?</p><p align="justify">Yeah, he would have been pretty pissed too.</p><p align="justify">Who was he kidding? He was pissed. Mr. Weasley was a good man who didn’t deserve any of this. And now Mrs. Weasley was like a shadow of herself, her worry, sadness and sleepless nights always noticeable, even when she put on a brave front for them and kept smiling.</p><p align="justify">None of this was fair.</p><p align="justify">Ron had vented for a bit and Harry had listened silently while Hermione held him. He suddenly stopped mid-rant to face him, his freckled face and calculating eyes more resolute than he had ever seen him.</p><p align="justify">“Dad almost got killed to stop You-Know-Who. I never knew my uncles because of the bastard and he won’t stop until he’s killed every single one of us. It’s more than time we put him down for good. I’m with you until the end, mate.”</p><p align="justify">Since then, Ron had been full of a newfound and almost frightening intensity. While the daily afternoon training sessions of the combat team had started out like an extension of last year's DA lessons, he had turned them into brutal military-style exercises.</p><p align="justify">That’s when the reality of what they were doing really hit him.</p><p align="justify">They were turning into soldiers. They weren’t kids getting in way over their heads and barely scraping by anymore. They were preparing to fight and end the war of their parents. Teaching them to defend themselves was one thing but this? He wouldn’t escape facing Voldemort since he kept chasing him but he didn’t want to send his crew against Death Eaters.</p><p align="justify">Bollocks, why couldn’t they have normal worries like quidditch and girls? Even just for one year? That’d be nice...</p><p align="justify">Deep in his thoughts, Harry never noticed Snape’s droning voice had stopped until his chair sprang to life, reared up and threw him to the ground. Snickers and half-whispered insults briefly filled the room as Snape waited for them to die out.</p><p align="justify">“Unless one of you miraculously managed to transcend my expectations and cast a silent confusion charm on Potter, it seems that our ever-slothful celebrity decided he could dispense himself from this lesson.” Snape said in an icy tone as he turned to look down back at Harry. </p><p align="justify">“Five points from Gryffindor. The Dark Arts are not to be underestimated and I will not tolerate daydreaming in this class. Was I clear enough for you this time Potter? Or would you rather spend your evenings in detention?”</p><p align="justify">Harry bit back the retort threatening to come out. As pleasant as the thought of taking the piss out of Snape was, he had better things to do with his evenings than scrubbing cauldrons...</p><p align="justify">It would be fun though...</p><p align="justify">But instead of letting his instincts get the better of him, Harry simply stood back up and put his chair back in place.</p><p align="justify">“Yes sir. Very clear.”</p><p align="justify">“As I thought.” Snape said with a tone of finality before turning around. He walked back toward his desk in great strides. Without stopping, he made the barely readable writings on the board vanish with a flick of his wand and addressed the class. ”You will write forty inches on the ways to differentiate and combat dark spirits without verbal incantations for Tuesday. Dismissed.”</p><p align="justify">Soon, Snape disappeared through the small door at the end of the room. Bolting up from his seat as if he was mounted on a spring, Harry picked up his bag with haste. In a <span class="kqEaA z8gr9e">practised</span> motion, he threw his things in it as quickly as he could before closing it and walking quickly toward the exit, Ron and Seamus hot on his heels. Bad enough he still had Snape after dropping Potions, he wouldn’t spend more time than needed in his classroom.</p><p align="justify">As they walked down the stairs of the tower, the trio debated the merits of releasing Lethifolds in Snape’s classroom and writing down his reaction for their essays.</p><p align="justify">“Mate, careful!”</p><p align="justify">As he paid little attention to where he was going, Seamus’s sudden shout was Harry’s only warning before running into a small boy in blue-trimmed robes. They’d barely begun to fall before Harry’s reflexes kicked in and he pulled the young Ravenclaw against his chest as he turned, bracing for the impact. The fall and pain he was expecting did not come, however, as he felt Ron’s hand grasp his collar and yank them back up.</p><p align="justify">“Easy there, Harry. Don’t go dying on us.”</p><p align="justify">”Yeah, that’d be a pretty shite way to die.”</p><p align="justify">Relaxing, Harry let out the breath he was holding as he let go of the boy. He couldn’t have been more than a third year and looked like a small animal, trembling all over like he was. He took a shaky step back and nearly slipped again, but Seamus put a hand on his shoulder to steady him. The boy’s eyes were wide in a mix of amazement and terror Harry had long come to know. Still, that’s no reason to be cruel to a kid.</p><p align="justify">"You alright there?”</p><p align="justify">The boy pulled up a piece of parchment from his robes with a trembling hand before throwing it in Harry’s direction and ran down the stairs without a word. The note bounced on his concealed armour plate and would have fallen down the stairs had he not caught it with practised ease.</p><p align="justify">“I swear, they’re treating you like a ghoul with dragon pox.” </p><p align="justify">“He’s probably worse in his eyes. Most blokes out there are convinced Harry killed Cedric and only escaped Azkaban because of his fame.”</p><p align="justify">The glare Ron sent to the back of the running boy could have melted Goblin steel.</p><p align="justify">“What, they still believe that crap the prophet’s printing?”</p><p align="justify">“Like everyone else.” Harry said bitterly, turning around and resuming his descent. Behind him, Ron and Seamus gave each other concerned looks before catching up with him.</p><p align="justify">He liked to think that it didn’t bother him. That he didn’t care since he was used to it. Reminding himself of that fact every time he walked through the castle with fearful stares glued to him didn’t seem to make it true, however.</p><p align="justify">Clenching his fists in frustration, Harry felt something crumble up in his grasp. Oh, right. The note. Probably the time for the next lesson with Dumbledore. Taking it out and unfolding it did not reveal the handwriting of the headmaster, however, but McGonagall’s instead. It was an invitation to meet for tea in her office that afternoon.</p><p align="justify">“Guess I’ll have to make a detour today.”</p><p align="justify">Harry reached the end of the stairs and decidedly did not look at the Ravenclaw he could still hear running away in the corridor. Instead, he took off in the opposite direction. He had to go see McGonagall anyway. And it’s been a while since he’d just walked around the castle so now was as good a time as any other.</p><p align="justify">His perfectly normal walk was not off to a great start, however, as he heard the voice of the last he wanted to see right now.</p><p align="justify">“Attacking kids now, Scarhead? I admit, even I didn’t think you’d swoop this low. Then again, you’ve always been the cowardly sorts.”</p><p align="justify">Malfoy, looking like the ever-arrogant pile of disdain and hair products he was, was surrounded by his usual cohort of housemates. And by the way, they looked at him, they seemed to find his situation to be the funniest thing since Umbridge’s takeover.</p><p align="justify">”How the mighty have fallen. Everyone’s finally realised none of that Boy-Who-Lived crap made up for the pathetic failure you are?”</p><p align="justify">“Sod off, Malfoy.” Ron snapped.</p><p align="justify">"I heard you didn't even bother going to the tryouts Potter. Did you expect your fame to get you the position like before? Or perhaps you don't want everyone to see you fail at the only thing you still have going for you?"</p><p align="justify">That got another laugh from the Slytherins, followed a few seconds later by Goyle’s. The burly boy seemed more focused on staring at Harry than listening to his master’s taunts. </p><p align="justify">"I just have other stuff to do, Malfoy. Maybe this year you'll actually have a chance to win a match? Or do you need your dad to buy that for you too?"</p><p align="justify">All traces of his smile faded, replaced by a grimace of anger and disgust as his pale hand hovered dangerously close to his wand. In the corner of his eye, Harry could see Ron mirror his movement. When he spoke next, Draco’s voice was low and cold.</p><p align="justify">“You should be careful with your words, Potter. You never know what could happen these days. And your precious Dumbledore won’t always be around to protect you. It shouldn’t be long before you get what you deserve and finally join your parents.”</p><p align="justify">Harry held his stare for a short time before Draco turned and left, quickly followed by his friends. His glare remained on him, even after the green-trimmed robes disappeared around the corner.</p><p align="justify">“What an arse.”</p><p align="justify">“That’s one reason I’m glad we can spend time you know where, and not in the castle. He’s been even more insufferable than ever lately. I’ve heard they’ve been prancing around the castle, terrorizing the younger years.”</p><p align="justify">“Give him one little shiny badge and he goes mad with power. I bet he can’t wait to get out there to start killing left and right.”</p><p align="justify">While Ron and Seamus talked, Harry’s gaze remained lost and a sombre mood marred his face. He remained silent until Ron stepped close and put a reassuring hand on his shoulder.</p><p align="justify">“You alright mate?”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah... Let’s just go.”</p><p align="justify">He still had to explain to McGonagall why he didn't have the time to play in the house team anymore... Or at least give a decent enough lie.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="justify">His spoon made a soft high-pitched sound as he put it back down on the saucer and took the cup to his mouth. His eyes wandered for a second as he took a sip of the tea. The room was sparsely decorated but held a lived-in atmosphere. Against the walls, a couple of old shelves holding books and knick-knacks were separated by the now empty glass case in which he’d seen the Quidditch cup the previous years. A heavy wooden desk, covered by a red and gold tablecloth, with neatly ordered tomes, graded assignments and a photo frame on top of it completed the room.</p><p align="justify">His attention came back to his professor sitting across from him, McGonagall was putting aside the tea-pot with a swish of her wand as her spoon was stirring by itself in the cup.</p><p align="justify">“I hope that you have settled back in well.” She asked as she put away her wand.</p><p align="justify">“Yes. It's always great to come back.”</p><p align="justify">Though he hadn’t seen the Gryffindor dormitory for half a year, the castle was as close to a home as he ever had.</p><p align="justify">“And we are always glad to see the students return.” A small smile played on her lips. “Though I fear I did not ask you to come so we could engage in small talk.”</p><p align="justify">What, really? He would have never guessed. After all, it was a perfectly normal thing for Harry to be called into her office by his head of house.</p><p align="justify">...This early in the year at least.</p><p align="justify">“I must say, I am a little concerned about your recent results. You decided against repeating a year to retake your O.W.L.s and to continue your education in a single discipline. Did you abandon your ambition of joining the Aurors?“</p><p align="justify">“Pretty much.” He shrugged. ”The Ministry isn’t really my biggest fan right now so I doubt they’d hire me even if I had the grades. I don’t know what I’ll do after graduation yet, but it’s not like I’m the only one in this situation.” </p><p align="justify">Far from it in fact.</p><p align="justify">Over the summer, the members of the DA had received their O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s results. For the vast majority of them, Harry included, the results were quite terrible, ranging from Dreadful to rarer Acceptables. The odd exceptions were the all-around great grades in the Defence Against the Dark Arts examination. And Hermione still passed a majority of her subjects of course.</p><p align="justify">Though it had led to a few uncomfortable talks with some parents, almost every one of them had lost interest in schoolwork. They couldn’t even think of losing the peace and wonders they’d found on <em>Requirements</em> to subject themselves to two more years of intensive cramming.</p><p align="justify">After a few animated evening talks over the stones, they had reached a consensus. They couldn’t just up and leave Hogwarts and lose both a chance for a minimal magical education and the only access they had to the ship. They would all choose one or two classes they could pretend to sit into, following their O.W.L.s results, and continue working on the ship during the rest of the week. Katie, Cho and Marietta, their remaining upperclassmen, even followed that example and dropped out of most of their classes.</p><p align="justify">Their remaining classes were a mix of either classes that could prove useful on the ship and others they liked so much that they just wanted to continue taking them. Harry and most of the combat group had made the rather drastic choice of dropping every class except Defence Against the Dark Arts.</p><p align="justify">Many would spend a part of their newfound free time doing things they had put aside or never tried before. Seamus had installed another easel next to Luna’s on the observation deck and Lavender had talked about creating an entire clothing line. Some even took the opportunity to pick up subjects that were not taught at Hogwarts, like Susan and Dean with healing.</p><p align="justify">They did have quite a few people so interested in learning as much as possible about the ship that they would work on it day and night if they could. Hermione, Lee and Terry had started devouring book after book of muggle science, trying to catch up and go beyond what they had missed during their magical education.</p><p align="justify">Between magic, science, foreign languages, arts, fashion and the all-around experimentations, the ship had become like a second school for them. It was a fun place to learn whatever you wanted at your own pace and a good way to take your mind off how things were going back home. Though they could all have done without Ernie’s rather disastrous attempts to learn how to play the bagpipes.</p><p align="justify">“Yes. It saddens me that the Ministry’s interference and the current situation have had such an impact on our students. No matter what career you decide to pursue, remember that my door is always open if you need to talk about it.”</p><p align="justify">She shook her head slightly before taking another sip. He’d never really considered just how different that normal these last few years had been for the staff. Sure, it’s how he’d always known Hogwarts and the magical world but things must have been quite different without murderous lunatics, ministry interference and ancient tournaments.</p><p align="justify">“Still, I wanted to talk to you about Quidditch. While I can understand that you might not want the responsibilities coming with the captain position, I was most surprised to learn that you chose to not be a part of the team this year.”</p><p align="justify">“Sorry about that professor. It’s just... There are too many things I need to do this year. I just don’t have the time for Quidditch practice this year. Even more so if I had to organise everything.”</p><p align="justify">Quidditch had been a big part of his life those last few years, but he just had so many things to do now... He couldn’t take part in those intensive training sessions at the crack of dawn when he had equally tiring combat exercises and a mountain of reports that never seemed to get smaller. He truly felt sorry for letting McGonagall down, though. She had been the one who gave him the opportunity to play and, most importantly, fly, as soon as his first year.</p><p align="justify">“Quite a shame. Not only does Griffindor lose a very gifted seeker, but I know that you love the game just as much as your father did.” McGonagall said with a nostalgic sigh. ”I offered the badge you declined to Miss Bell and while I know that she is more than capable for the position... Without any other member of the team returning, we will be hard-pressed to win the cup this year.” </p><p align="justify">“I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Katie has been playing as long as I have and will be a great captain. And with Ron and Ginny helping her, they have the making of a good team.“ Harry said as memories of the tryouts came back to him. He’d gone with Hermione and Luna to cheer on Ron and Ginny.</p><p align="justify">Ginny had been awesome and Katie would have struggled to find a better chaser. Unfortunately, her skilful demonstration had not helped to calm Ron’s nerves. Despite their best efforts to reassure him, he’d been a nervous wreck when he entered the field. He ended up fumbling with the quaffle a few times and almost didn’t make the team. He did manage to pull through in the end but it was a close thing.</p><p align="justify">“If you do not mind me asking Mr. Potter, what could possibly take so much of your time when you only attend a single class?”</p><p align="justify">“I know how it looks, but we-I’m quite busy working on my own projects.”</p><p align="justify">Great save Harry. Got any more fumbles planned today? </p><p align="justify">In the hope she would just ignore his mistake, he quickly continued.</p><p align="justify">”I know you don’t want me to fight with everyone out here, but Voldemort won’t stop because he can’t get to me. I can’t just stand around and study while other people are dying to protect us.”</p><p align="justify">At least not when he had access to things that could turn the war around.</p><p align="justify">“I promise it’s safe. Just... research and stuff like that. Nothing dangerous.”</p><p align="justify">And it was true... For now. But she didn’t need to know that.</p><p align="justify">McGonagall watched him intently for a moment before putting her empty cup down.</p><p align="justify">"I may be old, Mister Potter, but I am not senile quite yet. I know that many of your comrades are following you in whatever it is you are doing in secret. I want to make sure you will make sure they are safe and don’t do anything that would put them in the middle of this war.”</p><p align="justify">Shite. How much did she know? Play dumb Harry.</p><p align="justify">“Me? Why do you think they’ll listen to me, professor?” He asked in his most innocent voice.</p><p align="justify">This only seemed to irritate her, however, as she stared down at him like one would a misbehaving kitten.</p><p align="justify">“You are not quite as subtle as you’d like to think. The glances in your direction, the way they listen when you talk, how they move to protect you if they think a fight will break out in the hallways... If it was only young Ronald, I would be one thing, but all of them Harry? They look up to you as their leader. They follow your lead without question and I do not want to see them harmed because of foolhardy ambitions."</p><p align="justify">Ok, maybe that had been a bit too dumb.</p><p align="justify">“I’ll do what I can, professor. But there might come a time when we don’t have a choice.”</p><p align="justify">Her sigh as she finally broke her gaze had nothing nostalgic this time. Harry had a feeling of deja vu as she seemed to deflate a little, letting the weight of her age get to her for the first time since he knew her.</p><p align="justify">“I once taught an entire generation of brilliant young minds, only to see them be shaped and killed in a war they shouldn’t have been involved in. I hoped I would not have to live to see it happen again. I know you went through much during your stay here and I am sorry we could not prevent any of it or the current situation of our world. But you are still a child and should cherish these peaceful moments before being thrust into the pain and misery of a war that will do nothing but leave scars that will follow you your whole life.”</p><p align="justify">Her expression softened and a soft smile made its way back to her lips. With a tap of her wand, the kettle floated around to fill their cups once again.</p><p align="justify">“Take it from an old woman who spent most of her life watching children come and go in this dusty castle. These innocent times of fun and mischief with friends are too precious to be cast aside to deal with the adults' mistakes. A splash of milk?”</p><p align="justify">Definitely a deja vu.</p><hr /><p align="justify">Two weeks after his afternoon tea with his head of house, Harry was rubbing his neck while trying to decipher a security report. All this looking down was starting to give him neck cramps. Apparently, Malfoy had been spotted several times snooping around the seventh floor, looking for something. While he had no idea how he had learned of it, there was little doubt he had been searching for the room. Fortunately, the protections they had put around the hallway seem to have done the trick and they had yet to be discovered. </p><p align="justify">Who can find a door when the entire hallway is missing?</p><p align="justify">His musings were interrupted when someone nudged him in the sides. Tearing his eyes off the slate, he looked to his right to find Ron and Hermione, leaning against the railing of the observation deck and looking at him.</p><p align="justify">“Mate, can’t you take a break for two minutes and appreciate the moment?”</p><p align="justify">“Ron's right. It’s not every day you inaugurate a space station after all!”</p><p align="justify">On the other side of the force field, the impressive sight of the new Neptune station, completed at last. The entire crew had gathered on the various observation decks in small groups to see it light up for the first time.</p><p align="justify">The imposing structure was larger than the Requirement itself. Composed of two great arms shaped as opposing half circles joined in the middle by a blocky central node. Across the arms, rectangular shapes crossed the station vertically. Overall, the station had a sleek and alien feel to it, not too different from the ship itself.</p><p align="justify">“Alright, alright.” Putting away his slate, Harry brought up his communication stone to his mouth. ”Lee, you there?”</p><p align="justify">The response came quickly, but not from the second in command of his engineering corps.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, he’s here alright.”</p><p align="justify">“Well, that really depends on your definition of ‘here’. I’m pretty sure Lee’s in his own personal paradise right now.”</p><p align="justify">“Aaaahw, Would you just look at him? I hadn’t seen him this happy since we got him that pyjama for his tarantula last year.”</p><p align="justify">“Could we focus, please? We have almost thirty people to impress here." The twins had accompanied Lee to see to the finishing touches on the station before bringing it online, and Harry already regretted allowing their dispatch. "How are things on your end?”</p><p align="justify">“Pretty boring for now.”</p><p align="justify">”We hooked up the main generators and Lee’s trying to turn them on. Once he's done we can start conjuring some air and make sure we don't have a leak somewhere.”</p><p align="justify">“We’ve been practising some figures in zero-g in the meanwhile. Hey Fred, watch thi-Outch!”</p><p align="justify">They never got to hear the end, as Lee’s mad cackle came out of the stone before going into full-blown evil laughter territory.</p><p align="justify">“It’s alive! Muahahaha!”</p><p align="justify">Before them, the station came to life, its force field “windows” flaring up, and the many lights on the hull lighting up. After months of construction that saw the ship stuck in the planet’s orbit, the Neptune Station had been completed.</p><p align="justify">Its mining operations had been designed to be fully automated and it will serve as a storage and refuelling platform for the ship, freeing them from the tedious days of replenishing their stocks themselves. Embedded in the central node of the station was what Engineering had taken to call an “Industrial grade conjurator”. Coupled with the numerous conjuring beam arrays built-in all along the length of the station’s arms, the station would be able to take on much larger work than the Requirement’s smaller model. It would also be much more robust and they'd never have to worry about the overheating problem that delayed the construction of the station again.</p><p align="justify">It will also serve as the first official D.S.F. base, a permanent presence in the solar system and a link to Earth through Hogwarts. Terry had theorised that the Room of Requirement would not be able to open a door to the ship if they were to leave the system as the magical power needed to cross such distances would be beyond anything ever seen on Earth. While Hogwarts and the Room were fed by the multiple lay lines converging under its foundations, making it one of the largest magical hotspots on the planet, that was but a fraction of the power they would need to cross the void between star systems.</p><p align="justify">Though the name of the station was still up to debate amongst the crew, Harry was sure they would vote on something good.</p><p align="justify">The three of them couldn’t tear their eyes off the sight in front of them.</p><p align="justify">“So this is it, huum? We’re really doing this.” Ron said, more for himself than really asking for an answer.</p><p align="justify">“Yep... We’re doing this.”</p><p align="justify">“It’s only the beginning. We still have a lot of work to make it habitable and start the automated production of external storage facilities. Then we’ll be able to-“</p><p align="justify">“Hermione? Just enjoy the moment please.” Ron asked as he put a hand on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
Fixated as he was with the station, Harry never saw her soft smile as she took Ron’s hand into her own.</p><hr /><p align="justify">“To the commissioning of Platform 8 3/4! Cheers!”</p><p align="justify">The loud rock music was drowned for a moment as the entire crew plus Clarissa Edgecomb raised their drinks and cheered. All around them, confetti and streamers were flying all around in the dim light as Weasley cold-fireworks spun and burst overhead, lighting the room intermittently. On both sides of the room, long tables with way too many feet were crumbling under the weight of all the different dishes. Several crew members, led by Laender and Lee, had gone out on a shopping spree, bringing back all sorts of food and drinks, both muggle and magical, to fill the conjurator’s databanks. Seeing Ginny’s face when she tried her first cup of soda had been priceless.</p><p align="justify">All around Harry, people were talking, dancing and laughing. Angelina, Katie, Alicia and Cho flew high above on their hoverboards in an impressive aerial ballet mixed in with some daring stunts. Padma and Parvati were gushing around Lavender, trying to see every angle of the dress robe she made for the occasion. A few people were gathered around Seamus as he tried to replicate a muggle fire-breathing trick. Michael and Terry were cheering on Ernie as he tried to drink a small cask of firewhisky bottoms up. Fred and George were running away from an enraged Ginny with purple hair sticking out in every direction like a poisonous p<span class="BxUVEf ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">ufferfish</span></span>.</p><p align="justify">It was pure chaos around him.</p><p align="justify">And it was perfect.</p><p align="justify">This kind of party really was more his style compared to the boring and stuffy “little gatherings” of Slughorn. The man still tried to get him to join them every other week, but the one he attended aboard the express had quickly disillusioned him. Everyone gathered in small groups, talking in whispers or trying to curry favours form the teacher and each other while doing their best to either ignore him or to be seen sending scornful looks his way. Since then, he‘d ignored every invitation the man had sent out and did his best to avoid him. They were barely a month into the semester and he already regretted helping Dumbledore recruit the man.</p><p align="justify">That’s not to say everyone was going wild tonight.</p><p align="justify">Neville and Susan sat on the side, lost in a discussion about their plans for the medical section of the new greenhouses. Dean and Luna had pulled out big pots of paints from somewhere and were in the process of painting some sort of mural on the far wall while a few onlookers gave them ideas or even joined in. He could see Luna lost in her thoughts for a while as she gazed at the wall, before spreading and mixing a good dose of various colours on her butterfly palette until she obtained a bright turquoise. She then completely disregarded the large paintbrushes and began to paint the wall using the palette itself.</p><p align="justify">Zacharias sat on a sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face buried in his hands while next to him, Ron tried his hardest not to laugh. Earlier, he had heard the Hufflepuff suggest that they bring house-elves to the station to cook and do the laundry for them while Hermione was nearby. From where he watched, her drunken rant on elf exploitation and how the ship’s technology would deprive them of their work anyway was beginning to resemble a university lecture and he half expected her to pull a blackboard out of somewhere.</p><p align="justify">Abandoned by her daughter who went to congratulate Cho after her performance, Clarissa Edgecombe drank by her lonesome in a corner, seemingly lost as the only real adult at the party. He supposed now was as good a time as any to get to know her. She was a part of the DSF after all, even if she wasn’t part of Requirement’s crew. Ruffling his hair to get some of the confetti off it, Harry grabbed a bottle of butterbeer from a passing flying plate and made his way to her.</p><p align="justify">“Can I sit down?”</p><p align="justify">Clarissa raised her head to look at him, surprise evident on her face. She opened and closed her mouth a couple of times, unsure of what to say, before she gave him a small nod. Harry fell heavily on the bean bag next to hers. They sat awkwardly for a moment as Harry tried to find a good position while Clarissa looked at him nervously, seemingly unsure of how to act around him.</p><p align="justify">“Soooo... How are you doing?”</p><p align="justify">“I... Good. I guess I’m just a bit overwhelmed.”</p><p align="justify">All around them, people were dancing and partying as if there would be no tomorrow. And he couldn’t blame them. News of disappearances, attacks on muggle civilians, and even dementors roaming the country had become a daily occurrence. None of which they could do something about for now. So they danced and drank to forget, even for one night.</p><p align="justify">“I can see why. But we all need to let loose from time to time.”</p><p align="justify">“It’s not that it’s... Everything!” She exclaimed while making wide gestures encompassing the entire room. ”I was still processing the fact that you had a real spaceship, and now I’m attending a teenage party on a space station that looks like it came out of a sci-fi show. One that you didn’t find, but built from the ground up.”</p><p align="justify">”That we have. You’re part of this too.”</p><p align="justify">“And I’m thankful for the opportunity. It’s just... A lot to take in.”</p><p align="justify">“I understand the feeling. I was barely getting used to magic myself when we discovered all of this”</p><p align="justify">Just when he thought he finally understood magic, he discovered something that completely shattered his vision of the world with something that millions of people considered perfectly normal and part of their everyday life. And now, they had a spaceship with a galaxy’s worth of knowledge and mysteries on top of that. It was a lot to take in.</p><p align="justify">Clarissa seemed to finally relax a little as she sat back, sinking into her bean bag as she took a sip of her wine.</p><p align="justify">“When I’m working in the shop, things are so quiet. It’s easy to forget how crazy this whole thing is.”</p><p align="justify">“Actually, I’ve been meaning to ask, how are things with the shop? Do you manage on your own?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s going well. We even made some sales in the last month. I’m mostly spending my time talking with curious passersby or people looking for a job. If they seem interested, I take their information and resume and send them to Hannah. However, we have been getting more people coming in lately. I think the word that we’re recruiting is going around.”</p><p align="justify">“Hopefully we’ll find someone to help you out soon.”</p><p align="justify">“Well at least we’re not lacking volunteers, sir”</p><p align="justify">Harry grimaced slightly at the word. He was sixteen for Merlin’s sake.</p><p align="justify">“Call me Harry, please. It feels weird to have someone older than me calling me that.”</p><p align="justify">After that, Harry spent a good while just sitting there, talking about nothing and everything with Clarissa as the party went on around them.</p><hr /><p align="justify">On a dark and empty deck of Requirement, one of the consoles lit up on its own as the ship’s main computer launched a subroutine that had not been used in a very, very long time. After a few minutes, the light died out and the deck was once again plunged into darkness, leaving no trace of any activity. Deep in the ship’s database, however, the presence of an energy spike lost somewhere in the rocky mountains of the United States had been logged automatically.</p><hr /><p align="justify">“Cargo coming through! Sorry!”</p><p align="justify">Harry stuck to the wall to let the massive ‘hoverplate’ loaded with all sorts of glass tanks and gardening supplies Anthony was pushing through the corridor. He’d seen his fair share of the new iteration of Hermione’s latest modification of her hoverboard design around the station in the last couple of weeks. Wider, with a larger energy source and able to carry far more weight, those plates had been used by many of the crew to move around their equipment as they appropriated some of the empty rooms for themselves.</p><p align="justify">While they had touched up some parts of the station’s blueprint, mainly by the necessity of replacing the generators with something they could actually fuel, the design had been left as is. Beyond the main control room and a few others which they had reserved specifically for one department or another, a vast majority of them were unused and up for the taking.</p><p align="justify">With the exception of the twins who predictably decided to share one, each of their engineers now had an office where they could work on their personal projects in peace. They also had a giant room repurposed as a common laboratory where they could work on their more hazardous or larger projects.</p><p align="justify">Another of the large rooms had been turned into a damn jungle by Neville and Anthony. Where Harry had expected to see a row of greenhouses, he found instead that the room had been divided into several open floors housing a wide variety of ecosystems. A small adjacent room had also been requisitioned to grow rare plants that only flourished in complete darkness or something like that. He shuddered at the memory of the devil’s snare crawling its way around his ankle when he visited the room and took note to ask Neville to be careful with what he brought on board.</p><p align="justify">Ron had a field day when Seamus introduced him to some of his comic books and particular episodes of Star Trek. When he came around for his first combat training session on the station, Harry had expected the room to be filled with training dummies, a duelling platform, or maybe even an arena. Instead, he had discovered a recreation of Diagon Alley being blown up by Ginny’s spells as Luna brought up the pavement in front of her to form a shield. Since then, Ron had used the conjurator’s capabilities to build as many different battlegrounds as he could think of, be they a muggle street during a storm, the Ministry’s atrium or Hogwarts hallways, before disintegrating them into raw materials at the end of the sessions. But no matter the decor, the slight shimmer of a shield could be seen covering the walls, protecting the rest of the station from the destruction taking place in the room.</p><p align="justify">On the more relaxing side of things, Luna had taken one look at an observation deck and decided that she quite enjoyed the view of Neptune and its moons. The next day, they found the room covered with sitting pillows, bean bags, several telescopes and an easel. It didn’t take long for the rest of the crew to join in, hanging hammocks and paintings on the walls and installing a great screen on the wall. A refrigerator they had hooked up to the station’s power grid was filled to the brim with snacks, butterbeers, sodas and other drinks.</p><p align="justify">It quickly became the most popular hanging spot for the crew, where they could relax and catch up with each other, replacing the smaller one they had on the ship. They would all meet there at least once a week to watch a movie or one of the combat team’s mock battles.</p><p align="justify">It was this room that Harry entered that morning, to find it already filled with a dozen people. On the screen, Fred was riding on his bright red hoverboard and hit a bludger, sending it toward Cho who was speeding toward the flying goal rings. She crouched on her board and barrelled to the left, throwing the quaffle through the hoop as she dodged the iron ball. Cheers erupted in the room before the bludger hit the hoop, sending it spiralling into space. One of the players summoned back the quaffle while two others went to retrieve the missing goal as the spectators groaned at the interruption.</p><p align="justify">On the side, Lee and Terry were looking over the blueprints of those same hoops spread across a table. Taking some notes after watching the play, they started talking animatedly about manoeuvring thrusters and power sources and Harry quickly tuned them out. He’d read about it soon enough.</p><p align="justify">Instead, he took a bottle from the fridge and went to join the others on a sofa. For the first time in a while, he could quite honestly say that life was good.</p><p align="justify">If only it could stay that way...</p><p> </p>

  <p align="justify"><br />Out of the great vaulted windows of the bridge, they could see the chunks of rock, ice and clouds of dust that made up Saturn’s rings drifting beneath them as Requirement completed its lap of the planet. With the station now complete, they had resumed their travels around the solar system. He did not doubt that many of the crew were enjoying the view in the early hours of the evening on the various observation decks of the ship. Marvelling at the wonders of their home system was not the only reason they were flying around, however. </p><p align="justify">“Alright, now bring us close to that big asteroid to starboard and turn us around.”</p><p align="justify">Cho and Marietta, leaning over two opposite consoles at the front of the bridge, were hard at work calculating new trajectories on the fly and entering them in the flight computer. It was something that they had discovered while they continued to translate the ship’s systems. They could plot more complex courses instead of just inputting the coordinates of their destination and letting the computer come up with the quickest path. That allowed them more freedom in their travels, at the cost of complex calculations they would be hard-pressed to complete under pressure.</p><p align="justify">“Get more power to the front shields. We don’t want any stray debris hitting us.”</p><p align="justify">Near the left wall, Katie gave a nod before moving and turning a command stone on her own console. They could see the shield shimmer for a second outside the windows before disappearing again. Not far from her, Ernie monitored the readings of the ship’s internal and external sensors from his own station.</p><p align="justify">“We’re currently eight m-Sorry, <em> fourteen </em>kilometres away from the asteroid and going around it. Shields are stable and power consumption is within acceptable parameters.”</p><p align="justify">Yet another change they had to get used to. Knowing they were planning on recruiting magicals from all over the world, Parvati and Michael had insisted the crew start using the metric system. Harry would have preferred it the other way but he could see the logic since only a handful of countries used imperial units.</p><p align="justify">“Well done everyone, I think that’s enough for today. Cho, get us back to the station, please.”</p><p align="justify">“Aye aye, captain.”</p><p align="justify">With the Room now connected to the station, and the fact that they couldn’t open it from this side, the ship had lost its permanent link to Hogwarts. Gone was the door in what they had come to know as the entrance to the ship. On the occasional days when they decided not to get back to Neptune to dock the ship, one of the crew members that stayed behind on the station would go back to Hogwarts and open the Room to Requirement. It wasn’t a smooth process but it would work until the engineers found another way to travel between Earth and the station.</p><p align="justify">Tonight, however, they’d stopped the ship next to one of the station’s arms and stepped through the docking tube that had automatically extended at their approach. The crew dispersed, some going to their respective sections of the station to rest or work on their own projects, while a majority of them talked and laughed as they made their way to the communal deck. They spread out across the room in small groups, talking in hushed voices, reading books or just enjoying the view and each other’s company.</p><p align="justify">“So, when do we get to see something new?”</p><p align="justify">As Harry picked up a couple of bottles from the fridge, turned his head to see Zacharias, leaning on the counter they had installed.</p><p align="justify">“Something new?”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t get me wrong, this is amazing,” He turned and raised a hand to show the view of Neptune that took a significant portion of the observation bay. ”and I doubt I’ll ever get bored of it. But we’ve gone around the system a few times already. Isn’t it time we moved on?”</p><p align="justify">His wide gesture drew some attention and the conversations around them slowly died out as people started listening in. Harry gave a sight and stood up before closing the fridge behind him as Seamus joined the discussion.</p><p align="justify">“Wasn’t that the point of this whole thing? To get out there and see stuff? To find the aliens who built this ship?”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, we got an entire galaxy to explore. Why are we limiting ourselves to the solar system like that? It’s not like the ship can’t make the jump.”</p><p align="justify">Harry sent a bottle in Ron’s direction and opened his own, gulping before he answered.</p><p align="justify">“Believe me, I’d like nothing more than to tell you that we’ll go tomorrow. But it’s not that easy. We can’t just up and leave in the middle of a war. The trip itself could take weeks for all we know.”</p><p align="justify">”And what if something breaks down and we get stuck out there? We would be leaving everyone we know to Voldemort’s mercy.” Ron added, opening his own butterbeer.</p><p align="justify">Not that he had any...</p><p align="justify">That put a damper on everyone’s enthusiasm for a minute, as they shivered at the thought. Not all of them had lost family during his first rise to power, but everyone had heard the tales and knew many who did. Things down there were already taking a dark turn, and it was only the beginning.</p><p align="justify">There is, however, something to be said for the stubbornness of teenagers, and pleading voices could soon be heard once more.<br /><br />“Couldn’t we go, just for a short while? Like, we take a weekend and go visit another system while being extra careful. And I’m sure we can do something about the travel time.“</p><p align="justify">“Screw that! If we go, I want to stay at least a week to visit everything.”</p><p align="justify">“You know how big a planet is, right? I mean, look out the window man, you’d barely see anything in that time.”<br /><br />The room quickly filled with a hubbub of voices as everyone wanted to share their opinions on the matter and couldn’t wait for the others to finish.</p><p align="justify">In Harry’s mind, a little voice kept needling him, and even he had to admit the prospect of just taking off and starting exploring the stars, of leaving this country that saw him as little more than an attention-seeking nutjob to fend for themselves. Even just for a weekend so he could rest without having to think of the war...</p><p align="justify">Harry shook his head to scatter these thoughts and took a big swing of his drink. Ron had been right, and he knew himself well enough to know he’d never be able to relax while thousands of innocents were suffering as he played around.</p><p align="justify">The sound of a book being closed forcefully was quickly followed by a shout of a voice he knew all too well.</p><p align="justify">"It wouldn't work anyway!”</p><p align="justify">The cacophony toned down at Hermione’s exclamation, and every head turned to look at her. She looked supremely annoyed at all of them and clearly regretted that she hadn’t gone to her office earlier.</p><p align="justify">”We ran some numbers and we found out that with our current rate of energy generation, we are unable to maintain a stable hyperspace jump long enough to go the whole way to another system.”</p><p align="justify">Disappointed looks came upon most of the people present, but a few of the more technologically literate still held their hopes.</p><p align="justify">“Isn’t the whole point of hyperspace the fact that you <em> don’t </em> have to cross the whole distance but a fraction of it?”</p><p align="justify">“That’s true, but the energy required to open a stable hyperspace window and then maintain our speed while also keeping the shield up to protect us is ridiculous. It doesn’t even compare to what we use to move around the system.” Lee followed up.</p><p align="justify">“If it’s just a question of energy, can’t we just take a whole lot of fuel with us and make pit stops to fill up the reserves? We’re not exactly lacking the stuff now that the station is up.”</p><p align="justify">”That’s one solution. Refueling takes time though, and we’d need to open a new window each time to go back to hyperspace, which is the most energy-intensive part of the process. We would be stuck in between systems for a while, waiting for the energy reserves to fill up again until we can make the next jump. And we’re not exactly talking about a couple of times either.”</p><p align="justify">“You have to remember that this ship is supposed to work with a vastly more efficient fuel." Lee added. "With it, the aliens could have crossed half the galaxy in a day without putting so much as a dent in the power reserves.”</p><p align="justify">“So we can either stay here until we find a better solution or spend months trying to reach the closest system? This sucks!”</p><p align="justify">All around, grumbles of discontent rose once again at the news. People were starting to break out before Lee spoke once again, a big grin on his face.</p><p align="justify">“Oh come on, it’s not that bad. Besides, there’s still tons of cool stuff to see in the system. Like, Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons, is one big ball of ice! Anyone else up for ice skating down a mountain?”</p><hr /><p align="justify">The golden rays of the setting sun bathed the Gryffindor common room as flames crackled in the hearth, offering them some respite against the cold of the Scottish autumn. A few of their housemates were playing or talking in hushed voices, and a group of seventh-years were practising the nonverbal transfiguration of a table into a hippopotamus with mixed results.</p><p align="justify">Harry, Ron and Hermione sat at a table so loaded with books one would think they were on the eve of their N.E.W.T.s. Very few of them were related to magic however, though some would say astrophysics and micro-engineering were magical in a way. Hermione was, of course, one of those people, seeing how she devoured the dense volumes, taking extensive notes and stopping every few minutes to cross-reference some things from the half-dozen other books she had opened around her. From time to time, she had to take out a new book from the pile next to her, earning herself some annoyed meowing from Crookshanks who had decided to sleep rolled up atop of the pile.</p><p align="justify">But far from these scientific preoccupations, Harry and Ron were hard at work over lengths of parchment covered with runes. Open next to them were two copies of the same red leather-bound tome, completely identical, down to the handwritten annotations and notes about the ship's variants of the runes added by Hermione and Angelina and the butterbeer stain on page sixty-height.</p><p align="justify">"... And with Ehwaz and Raidho it means... The horse rides the morning sun?”</p><p align="justify">"Nah, It's Mannaz, not Ehwaz. The rider went to the east."</p><p align="justify">With a groan of defeat, Harry burrowed his head in the book. They had been learning runes for a few months now, and while Ron did encounter some success, Harry was still incapable of reading a single phrase correctly.</p><p align="justify">"Why do I even have to learn this? Can’t we just use Angie’s dictionary once she finishes it? Or better yet, I could ask Ernie to translate for me when I need it?"</p><p align="justify">"Because you need to know how to read if you are to quickly issue orders during dangerous situations.” Hermione answered without looking up from her own studies.</p><p align="justify">Harry groaned again</p><p align="justify">“But it's not like we’re going to read runes forever! Terry assured me he was making good progress on his translation program.”</p><p align="justify">“Err, I’m pretty sure he only told you that so you’d get off his back, mate. You’ve been bugging him about it for weeks.”</p><p align="justify">“We're still years away from understanding enough of the computer’s inner workings to even attempt modifying it like that. And that’s without taking into account our other projects and the actual programming of the translation software."</p><p align="justify">Harry sighed and took his head out of the book. Despite his reticence, he understood that he had to do this, but this book was even dryer than a history of magic lecture. At least Binns talked about fun stuff sometimes, like the two-day rebellion of Grektuk Coppertongue who rebelled against the Goblin nation to establish the right to eat cakes in the underground cities.</p><p align="justify">“I’m just thankful we only have to learn these runes and not all the other alphabets they teach in the class. That would have been the death of me.” Ron said as he stretched his legs.</p><p align="justify">“It wasn’t that bad. Professor Babbling is a great teacher who knows how to make her subject interesting. She had us write and translate jokes to each other sometimes.”</p><p align="justify">“Like Snape had us try out each other’s volubility solutions that one time?”</p><p align="justify">“Maybe? But we didn’t end up with a talking gerbil infestation at least.”</p><p align="justify">One of the rare good memories Harry had of his five years of potion classes. He’d also heard rumours that one gerbil had escaped and could still be heard pondering the mysteries of the universe in the dungeons’ walls. Maybe it took a page off the Basilisk’s book and made its nest in the castle’s pipes?</p><p align="justify">His zoological musings were quickly interrupted by Ron however.</p><p align="justify">“Come on mate, let’s get this over with.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">Another week of training and monitoring the crew had come and gone and the whole thing had begun to feel like a routine for Harry. A tiring and mostly boring routing but it did have its exciting moments. Now, however, coming to break this well-oiled machine was the first weekend of October and his second lesson with Dumbledore. The headmaster seemed to have his own worries and had been a rare sight in the castle these days. His seat was empty more often than not during meals, and it had been a while since anyone had seen him walk around the halls like he loved to.</p><p align="justify">Two days ago, however, a ghost found Harry busy in the fourth floor’s bathroom to inform him of his availability this weekend. Once the embarrassment passed, curiosity took its place. Their first session had only been some cryptic talks of the prophecy and memories about Voldemort’s past, which did provide some context. Harry still didn’t see how that was supposed to help him fight against him.</p><p align="justify">It was with a head full of questions that Harry climbed the stairs to the headmaster’s office that Saturday evening. He’d made sure to leave his stone on the ship before coming. Not that he wouldn’t share the important parts of the lessons with the crew, but he had promised Dumbledore to be careful with what he learned.</p><p align="justify">He knocked on the door and entered the office when invited to. Dumbledore sat on the side in a heavily padded purple armchair that clashed with his vibrant yellow robes. In front of him, the pensive had been placed on a low table, sending ripples of silver light to the ceiling.</p><p align="justify">Memory night it is then.</p><p align="justify">“Good evening Harry. I must apologise for the sore lack of news this past month. Though I was asked quite rudely to leave my positions in the ministry and the international confederation, I find myself to be quite occupied.”</p><p align="justify">“It’s fine sir. I’ve had a lot to do myself.”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore tilted his head forward slightly with an amused look on his face. He watched Harry from above his glasses as he sat down across from him.</p><p align="justify">“Oh? And may I ask what exactly kept you awake these last few weeks? You do seem terribly tired these days.”<br /><br />Harry squirmed uncomfortably on the plush armchair, his eyes looking everywhere but at Dumbledore’s.</p><p align="justify">“I’d rather not say, sir.”</p><p align="justify">That got a chuckle from Dumbledore.</p><p align="justify">“Then I won’t pry. I will however ask you the same courtesy regarding my activities outside the castle.”</p><p align="justify">That request soured Harry’s mood quickly.</p><p align="justify">“Do not be so dispirited. I did not forget my promise of keeping you informed and I will tell you all I know soon. First, however, there are things you must see so you can understand.”</p><p align="justify">No poker for me then.</p><p align="justify">With his good hand, Dumbledore brought Harry’s attention to the pensive. His eyes, however, were drawn to the blackened and ghoulish hand immobile on the armrest. Another reminder of things he would be told “in time”. He was beginning to think that this newfound trust and partnership with the headmaster was a two-step-forward, one-step-back kind of deal. But it was still better than last year, at least. And if there is one thing he’d learned by having to keep his crew in check, it was patience, he thought as he leaned forward.</p><p align="justify">For long minutes afterwards, the silence of the room was only perturbed by the wheezing and rattling of the various devices exposed around the office as the two wizards kept their heads in the engraved stone bowl. When they finally emerged, Harry’s agitated expression was a far cry from the reaction expected by the headmaster.</p><p align="justify">He stood up, pacing around the room while gesturing widely to punctuate every word.</p><p align="justify">“I got it! That’s what I missed the first time! I couldn’t get a good look at it in the Gaunt shack, but It was so clear now!”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore tried to get up to calm him down, but in his haste put his weight on his bad hand. He fell back down heavily on the armchair with a small cry of pain. Pulled out of his frenzies, Harry hurried to the headmaster’s chair and keeled next to him.</p><p align="justify">“Are you alright sir?”</p><p align="justify">In this instant, Harry could not see Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the greatest Wizard of this age and headmaster of the most prestigious school in the world. All he saw was a tired old man trying to find his breath as he fought the pain in his hand.</p><p align="justify">“I... I will be alright, Harry. Thank you.”</p><p align="justify">“I'm sorry, I shouldn’t have-”</p><p align="justify">“Do not apologise for my mistake, Harry. Everything is fine.”</p><p align="justify">Things sure did not look fine right now though.</p><p align="justify">Crap, was this how Mme Pomfrey felt every time he ended up in the infirmary? He owed the matron an apology.</p><p align="justify">After a moment, Dumbledore’s breathing returned to normal and his drawn features relaxed. He looked up at Harry.</p><p align="justify">“Tell me, what did you see in Burkes’ memory that shook you so much?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s... The locket sir. The Gaunt’s. Slytherin’s. I found it in Grimmauld Place last Christmas. The thing was giving me the most painful headache until I locked it up.”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore’s eyes widened and if not for his painful arm, he had no doubt he would be the one pacing around this time. Instead, he grasped Harry’s arm with his good hand and looked him straight in the eyes, his own full of concern and urgency.</p><p align="justify">“Did you touch it directly? Do you still have it?”</p><p align="justify">Taken aback by his reaction, Harry could only stare at the distress in the man’s eyes for a moment. It’s not like Dumbledore had the strength to hold him tight enough to hurt him in his current state, but he had never seen the headmaster afraid before now.</p><p align="justify">“I-No, I moved it with a fire poker. It’s in a box, in my trunk.”</p><p align="justify">Without losing a second, Dumbledore dropped his arm and called to the air.</p><p align="justify">“Filzib!”</p><p align="justify">An aged house-elf with tufts of white hair coming out of his ears and dressed in a relatively clean pillowcase sporting the Hogwarts emblem appeared with a soft pop in the room.</p><p align="justify">“Head-professor Dumbly called?”</p><p align="justify">“Could you please go and retrieve young Harry’s trunk in his dorms and bring it here, please? A dangerous artefact may be stored in it. Take every precaution and do not touch it under any circumstance.”</p><p align="justify">Wait, in his dorm room? The empty one where no one had slept in for weeks now?</p><p align="justify">“Errrh... Sir? I don’t think that’s really necessary.”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore brought his attention back to him for an instant, before turning his eyes to his decayed hand.</p><p align="justify">“I made the mistake of underestimating these artefacts once, Harry, and I paid dearly for it. I do not want to risk another incident.”</p><p align="justify">“I mean... Now that I think about it, I didn’t want to risk another headache so I hid it somewhere in the castle. I can go get it right now.”</p><p align="justify">The scrutinising gaze of Dumbledore pierced him for a tense moment, as if the headmaster sought to somehow see the truth in his words through him.</p><p align="justify">“Please... Trust me.”</p><p align="justify">With a heavy sigh, Dumbledore sat back in his chair.</p><p align="justify">“Alright. But promise me that you will be careful.”</p><p align="justify">Harry did not waste any time and left to retrieve the locket from its hiding place, which happened to still be at the bottom of his trunk, presently stored in a corner of his room on Requirement. When he returned to the office, it was with a small chest made out of solid silver that he held at arm’s length. The elf was gone and Dumbledore was standing next to his desk.</p><p align="justify">“Quite an impressive box you found. Another forgotten heirloom you found in Grimmauld I presume?”</p><p align="justify">“Er... Yes, sir.”</p><p align="justify">It wasn’t technically a lie. He had first seen it there, though it had been made on the ship and sent to him via owl.</p><p align="justify">After setting the box down on the headmaster’s desk delicately, Harry took a step back and turned, only to be met with the sight of Dumbledore offering him the sword of Gryffindor.</p><p align="justify">“If you would do me the honour of disposing of it. I am afraid my strength is not quite what it used to be.”</p><p align="justify">Awkwardly taking the sword by its ruby-encrusted hilt, Harry hesitated an instant. Sure, the locket was definitely a dark artefact, one passed down by Voldemort’s family, but stabbing it with a sword seemed a bit overkill. Dumbledore, however, did not seem perturbed in the least. He watched Harry with a serious look, all traces of the joyful headmaster searching for the castle’s mysterious chamber pot room gone.</p><p align="justify">Harry opened the box and was instantly taken by a severe headache. Whispers of words he could not make out filled his ears and his scar throbbed in pain. Gritting his teeth, he took the sword with two hands and raised it above the box before thrusting the blade downward.</p><p align="justify">The instant the tip of the blade made contact with the locket, the whispers became incoherent screams of fear, rage and agony, and thick black smoke spread from the box as a black liquid boiled from the locket’s wound.<br /><br />The moment seemed to last an eternity until Harry felt a hand rest on his shoulder. The sights and sounds blurring his senses calmed down, the pain and his strength fading away as Dumbledore guided him to a chair. He sat down heavily and lost his grip on the sword, which fell to the floor with a metallic clatter. Dumbledore carefully picked it up and stored it away in a display case on the wall before he sat down at his desk</p><p align="justify">They stayed like this for a moment, Dumbledore giving him the time to settle down before he spoke once more.</p><p align="justify">“I need your word Harry, that you will not speak of what I am to tell you to anyone, for as long as you live. The task ahead of us is perilous and you will be tempted to share it with your friends. Its secrecy is vital however if we are to ever win this fight against Voldemort and any who would rise to replace him.”</p><p align="justify">Forget the step back, it seemed like tonight was a sprint to the finish line.</p><p align="justify">“Of course, professor.”</p><p align="justify">What followed was a long retelling of Dumbledore’s quest of these last few years. He had always suspected Voldemort somehow managed to escape death that fateful night, but his suspicions as to how began when Harry brought him the remains of the diary. This was a magic so dark and obscure that few dared speak of it, and fewer still to record traces of its existence. The very purpose of the magic made its secret both its best defence and the greatest insurance against its use. One could not create or destroy what they did not know existed. Dumbledore did however manage to gather enough information to make an educated guess as to the nature of these artefacts, before finding century-old texts describing them.</p><p align="justify">Horcruxes. Phylacteries. Soul jars. They had borne many names since ancient times but those abominations could be found spread out throughout history if one knew what to look for.</p><p align="justify">He was unsure of how many Voldemort made but he had a lead to obtaining this information. He searched for any artefacts linked to the founders and Voldemort’s own past that he could have used to host fragments of his soul. He’d even considered Hogwarts to be the hiding place of one such object but he did not find anything after searching the castle from top to bottom. It was only this summer that his search bore fruits when he found the ring and lost his arm to its protection. The last things he revealed were the very rare and dangerous ways of destroying a Horcrux and the importance of the sword in their endeavour.</p><p align="justify">The moon shone high in the sky and the candle in the office melted the last of its wax when he finished.</p><p align="justify">That... Was a lot to take in. But it also explained a lot. And as long as these Horcruxes were out there, Voldemort would keep coming back to haunt them. Harry’s traitorous mind was quick to imagine the worst possibility, however. While they were on earth, the artefacts could be found and destroyed. But if Voldemort ever managed to send one into space...</p><p align="justify">They talked for a while about what they would do and how Harry could help with the search. They agreed that they would continue to explore Voldemort’s past, looking for clues, and once Dumbledore managed to track down another Horcrux, they would go retrieve it together.</p><p align="justify">“... I fear, however, that the hour is drawing late, and we could both gain from some rest. We can continue our talk during our next lesson.”</p><p align="justify">As he got up and ready to leave, a thought came to Harry’s tired mind. One that had nagged at him those last few weeks. He stilled as he picked up the now empty box before he gave an apprehensive look to Dumbledore.</p><p align="justify">“Professor? I’ve thought a bit about that memory of the orphanage you showed me the last time and... I can’t help but think that the way you used magic on the director and to intimidate Riddle was just plain wrong. The scale isn’t the same but it’s the same thing the ministry or the Death Eaters do, playing with muggles and bullying people into compliance.”</p><p align="justify">Since the day Hagrid had burst into his life and showed him the wonders of magic, he had seen amazing, beautiful things. Even today, while they used it around the ship, it never failed to surprise him. It certainly had its darker aspects, a perversion of nature’s gifts, but he knew that it wasn’t what magic was at its core.</p><p align="justify">He had expected Dumbledore to look shocked or at least a bit angry at the accusation. For the man to take offence to being compared to what he fought against his whole life.</p><p align="justify">Instead, the headmaster gave a deep sigh, looking at his empty hands.</p><p align="justify">“Yes, I can see how it can seem like that. I never claimed to be perfect Harry, no matter what others say about me. I am but a silly old man who made as many mistakes in his life as the next man. And my approach to the young Tom was no doubt one of the greatest among them. I did not try to understand him or his reasons. I thought I could give him a little scare, to put him back on the right track. I failed spectacularly, permanently marring his opinion of me and helping to create the worst disaster of our time. When I understood my error, it was already too late to fix it. The damage had been done.”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore looked up at Harry.</p><p align="justify">“Instead of suspicions and punishments, I should have guided him with forgiveness and kindness. I was not as empathetic as I should have been, battling as I was with the rise of Grindelwald and my own ego. I would like to think that I have changed for the better since then, however, I cannot stop wishing that I had acted differently.“</p><p align="justify">“Great minds have spent their lives pondering how things could have been different if some events had happened differently, though I will leave those musings to the historians. Could Tom have grown to not become Lord Voldemort? Perhaps. Would the world be a better place or would something worse have happened? No one knows. I personally prefer to spend my time trying to improve what I can instead of pondering questions without answers. It is only by working on improving the present that we may build a brighter future.”</p><p align="justify">“If there is one thing you learn tonight, Harry, please make it this one: Fighting with hate and anger instead of empathy and understanding will only lead you to grief.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">In the early hours of the next day, the castle slowly came to life as students and teachers enjoyed the peace and warmth it provided them on a Sunday morning before the start of another week of scholarly pursuits.</p><p align="justify">Detached from this peaceful dawn, a lone figure watched the sun rise above the mist-covered forbidden forest from one of the balconies, holding on tight to the stone railing with the vigour of rage and desperation.</p><p align="justify">The only sound one could hear was that of tears falling to the stones below him.</p><p align="justify">At his feet lay the crumpled remains of a special edition of the daily prophet. The front page was almost entirely reserved for a picture of the smouldering ruins of what must have been a great manor surrounded by beautiful gardens.</p><p align="justify">Below it, the headline announced the death of Augusta Longbottom and Amelia Bones.</p>

  <p align="justify">The sound of his shoes hitting the metal floor was Neville's only companion through the deserted corridors in the late hours of the night. The last of his tears had been shed hours ago, leaving him with nothing to distract himself from all too familiar thoughts.</p><p align="justify">As he felt his ruminations slip once again into darker territories, he reached for the nearest control panel, opening a door. Behind it was one of the many observation decks, furnished with a rug and a couple of sofas on which two of his crew mates talked in hushed voices. At the soft hiss of the opening door, they turned toward him in surprise... and there it was again.</p><p align="justify">The pity in eyes that wouldn't even meet his own.</p><p align="justify">At first, full of rage, he had not wanted to hear their condolences and righteous anger. When it faded, leaving behind an agonising sorrow, they had been welcome signs of support from his friends and shipmates. Now though, dulled after days of grief, he was sick of them walking on eggshells around him and looking at him as if he was a sick dog they'd have to put down.</p><p align="justify">He gave them a curt nod before pressing the door panel again, closing it before they would say a word.</p><p align="justify">He resumed his heavy walk, letting his feet carry him once again in search of a place where he could finally be alone. A place where no one would hover around him ceaselessly to offer the same stale platitudes he'd heard a thousand times.</p><p align="justify">He wandered for a while through the identical metal corridors until, finally, he came out of his brooding in a section of the ship he did not recognise. Though it was hard to tell with the smooth metal corridors looking so similar to one another, he was pretty sure he had walked all the way to the uninhabited part of the ship. It wouldn't be strange, really, what with more than three-quarters of it being repurposed as a storage area.</p><p align="justify">With the completion of the station, they had begun to empty those rooms and explore them from time to time, though they must not have reached this floor yet, as the room was filled with crates and large gas tanks. Neville closed the door behind him, advancing through the room in the dim light that came from a small window opening in the star-filled darkness of space. He went to sit on one of the crates lying in front of it, intent on losing himself in the view before he ended up lost to his own thoughts.</p><p align="justify">As he reached it, however, he found it already occupied. Susan made for quite a sorry sight as she sat on the floor with her back to the crate and held her knees to her chest. Her long copper hair were in disarray and her eyes were red from tears that had long since dried on her cheeks. He might have commented on it if he didn't suspect he would have seen the same thing, had he looked in a mirror.</p><p align="justify">For a moment, he stood there and looked at her with what must have been a dumb look on his face. Unsure of whether he should say something to the only person who could understand him right now, or just leave her alone with her thoughts. She had come here to be alone, as he had, but seeing her like this...it was hard to bring himself to simply turn back and find another room.</p><p align="justify">So he spoke, with a hoarse and uncertain voice, ignoring the part of him that called out his hypocrisy as he had fled the people ready to do just that for him.</p><p align="justify">"Hey..."</p><p align="justify">"Hey." She answered softly, her gaze still fixed on the sight outside the window.</p><p align="justify">"Can I...Can I sit here?"</p><p align="justify">At her weak nod, he joined her on the floor. They remained here in silence for a long time, a thousand words on the tip of his tongue, but none daring to pass his lips. No one had seen much of her since...since they'd heard the news. Thinking back, he was ashamed that he had begun to resent her for leaving him to be the sole recipient of the crew's overbearing considerations. Though he knew she must have been as sick of condolences and pity as he was. So they sat in silence, neither of them saying a word for what seemed like hours as they watched the stars and took comfort in each other's presence.</p><p align="justify">Until finally, she talked.</p><p align="justify">"You know...I don't remember my parents. Not really anyway." She began, her voice barely a whisper. "A few flashes of her hair, of his hands...my aunt's the only one that's always been here for me. It was just us, living in that big empty house, taking care of each other for as long as I can remember. And now she's just...gone. Just like that. And I didn't...I couldn't..."</p><p align="justify">Her voice died as she shut her eyes tight, trying to hold back the tears that swelled in her eyes once more.</p><p align="justify">He knew how she felt. Despite visiting the Janus Thickey ward of St Mungo's every year since he was two, he had never truly known his parents. He still loved them, but he couldn't escape the fact that he had only ever seen the pale husks of their former selves. And since Uncle Algie died two years ago, his gran had been his only real family.</p><p align="justify">"It's the little things that are the hardest, I think. To know that she won't be there, tidying up the house with a swish of her wand after I put mud everywhere coming back from the garden. That I'll never laugh as she sends another petitioner running after they tried to bribe her." She said with a little laugh. "It's weird, but I'd give anything to hear her scold me because I'm not sitting straight enough again."</p><p align="justify">That seemed to cheer her up a little as a smile crept up her face, small as it was.</p><p align="justify">"My aunt used to threaten me that she'd sick one of her aurors on me if I didn't behave during dinner. She nearly did once, too. I'd planted some chomping cabbages in the garden and smuggled a few in the kitchen on a night when we had guests from the Wizengamot."</p><p align="justify">That got a chuckle out of them both until the comfortable silence took back its place for a while, soon to be broken as Neville's brow furrowed and his tone became serious.</p><p align="justify">"I was furious when I learned. If they hadn't stopped me, I would have gone and...I don't know. I was ready to kill someone, anyone even remotely responsible."</p><p align="justify">For the first time, Susan tore her gaze off the window to look at him as he grasped his chest, just over his heart.</p><p align="justify">"But now? Now it's just gone and I feel...empty. I want to be angry. Or sad, or anything, really. But it's like I burned out and there's a...a hole here."</p><p align="justify">"As if they took a part of us when they took them."</p><p align="justify">Neville nodded, his jaw clenched as tightly as his hand that tried to grasp something that wasn't there anymore.</p><p align="justify">His whole body relaxed in surprise as he felt a weight come upon his shoulder and saw long red hair cascade down his arm. Unsure of what to do, he stood perfectly still, never turning his head to look at her. Not even when he felt the tears roll down his arm.</p><p align="justify">"They say that the loved ones who left aren't really gone. That they'll always stay with you in memory...but I don't want memories. I want her back...I just want her back..."</p><p align="justify">He doesn't know how long they sat there in silence after that, watching the stars through a small window that overlooked a space just as empty as they felt.</p><hr /><p align="justify">"Ensign Pryden is due for a visit of the station tomorrow, and his place in the eastern dormitory has been prepared. Once settled in, he'll start helping Hannah sort through the other applications, two of which you still have to review before they can be brought in for their final interview."</p><p align="justify">There was no nice way to say it: Harry's office was a mess. Piles of unread reports that never seemed to go down sat next to clippings from the prophet, unfinished school essays and the odd reference book. Command stones and various magical knick-knacks were used as paper-weights to keep the precariously piled-up parchments from collapsing.</p><p align="justify">Sitting down amongst that bureaucratic chaos, Harry dug around, trying to find the relevant reports as Ernie continued to list everything that needed his attention.</p><p align="justify">"On another note, Katie and Hermione are still waiting for you to green-lit the weapon test they want to conduct next week, now that they have found a suitable target."</p><p align="justify">Oh right. He was sure he'd seen Katie's demand somewhere in the left-most pile yesterday...</p><p align="justify">His hands stopped their search as he uncovered his most recent collection of prophet clippings, previously buried under a monograph on manticores. While the size of the extracts varied, their content was almost always the same. Weeks had passed since that first article, and the prophet continued to announce the deaths of political figures vocal about their opposition to the Ministry's new direction every few days. Most had been portrayed as accidents, but more than a few had been labelled as murders by the press without providing any suspects.</p><p align="justify">There was no doubt Voldemort was preparing the ministry for his conquest, taking advantage of the public's denial of his return. Harry couldn't shake the feeling that some piece of the puzzle was still missing though. The man was certainly brutal and cruel, but he remained a crafty schemer with a love for the theatrical above all else. The murders and this slow takeover were only building up to the next part of his plans, which only promised an escalation of the conflict. However, without any clue as to what it was, they had no way to prepare for it.</p><p align="justify">It's not like they had sat idly while people were dying either. They'd done their best to convince as many of their family members who still worked at the ministry and other potential targets to relocate to their newly bought safe houses throughout the country.</p><p align="justify">While it would work for now, keeping those people hidden in the middle of nowhere was not a viable long-term solution. They needed to keep them supplied and it would become increasingly harder to convince them to stay there. They were already working on getting those who agreed out of the country, but many still felt too attached to Britain and their life here to simply up and leave.</p><p align="justify">And that was those who had listened to them. Percy had been an increasingly sore subject as of late with the Weasley.</p><p align="justify">"You know...There are talks among the crew about taking revenge. To go out and fight."</p><p align="justify">Harry put down the book as he mentally cursed himself for leaving an opening for Ernie. He'd noticed the stares, of course, and he was far from the only one to direct these silent pleas toward him these days. Harry forced his hands to start moving again, pretending to search for whatever report he was supposed to find.</p><p align="justify">"As long as they only talk, there's nothing to worry about."</p><p align="justify">That, it seems, was exactly what he <em>shouldn't</em> have said. He could almost feel Ernie's brows furrow behind him.</p><p align="justify">"You need to address this. Neville and Susan both lost the only family they had left. Everyone's worried theirs will be next. They've been training for this, and we have the ship on our side."</p><p align="justify">Harry stopped again, clenching his fists above the sprawled-out parchments.</p><p align="justify">"So what, you want us to assault the ministry with less than thirty barely trained students? To kill everyone that gets in our way? We'd all be dead before we cleared the second floor, and they'd still be here tomorrow. The worst of them won't even be there, but hiding in their heavily warded manors out in the countryside."</p><p align="justify">In the past, Harry had been brash and impulsive, jumping into danger without so much as an afterthought for his own safety, and he nearly died each time because he didn't stop and think. Oh sure, he'd do it again in a heartbeat, as he was doing the right thing that no one else seemed inclined to do at the time, but it wasn't just him anymore. Having so many friends and comrades eager to join you in the face of certain death had a strange way of sobering you up when their lives depended on you making the right call.</p><p align="justify">And then there was the prophecy. As long as the ministry kept denying his return, Voldemort had to lie low and scheme, avoiding open attacks and giving them time to prepare and learn as much as they could about the ship. It was a great advantage, but one with a steep cost that kept increasing by the day.</p><p align="justify">"I'm on your side in this, but if you don't address it soon, one way or the other, they might try to take matters into their own hands."</p><p align="justify">He understood that feeling all too well. Hell, he wanted nothing more than to go out there himself and actually do something in this war for once. But this ship, everything they'd learned... It changed everything. They opened Pandora's box and what they found inside was both a blessing and a responsibility he wasn't sure they were ready to bear.</p><p align="justify">Every fibre of his being was shouting that he was letting them down, that he was letting <em>himself</em> down by stopping them from saving all the people suffering out there. But try as they might, they weren't ready to face Death Eaters in a real fight to the death. He'd been lucky during his misadventures with Ron and Hermione, but this was a real war against dozens of fully trained killers and veterans, not the insane shade of a dead man. One careless mistake and their greatest weapons would be in the hands of an immortal maniac with delusions of grandeur.</p><p align="justify">So he did the only thing he could. He turned to face Ernie, trying his hardest to look him in the eye despite the worries and concern he could see in them.</p><p align="justify">"What do you want me to say? That they're not the first to lose their family in this stupid war, and that they certainly won't be the last?" His tone was perhaps harsher than strictly necessary, but his own words tasted like ash in his mouth, and he really didn't want to have this conversation right now. Perhaps not ever. "Tell them that if they go out to fight, they will not only die but doom this entire galaxy in the process. We're already doing all we can and I won't risk those still alive to avenge the dead. End of discussion."</p><p align="justify">"Captain, I don't think-"</p><p align="justify">"I said we're done."</p><p align="justify">"Yes but-"</p><p align="justify">"We're <em>done</em>, Lieutenant. Good night."</p><p align="justify">Ernie's expression turned grim as he gave a brisk salute before turning away, leaving the room after giving him one last look.</p><p align="justify">Harry was fuming, and despite what the little voice in his mind tried to tell him, it wasn't because of Ernie. He hadn't done anything to deserve that he took out his frustration on him, only offering his advice and support. No, Harry was furious with himself. He could lie all he wanted to Ernie and the others, but he couldn't lie to himself.</p><p align="justify">So once again, he did the only thing he could. Turning toward his desk to start reviewing the pending reports, he ignored the pale complexion and the dark circles under the eyes of his reflection on the data slate in front of him.</p><hr /><p align="justify">"Captain, we're finishing our approach and settling in at a distance of six hundred twenty mil-sorry, a thousand kilometres."</p><p align="justify">Behind the vaulted windows of the bridge, the distant grey and brown colours of their target clashed against the blackness of space. The asteroïd, which had been nothing more than a barely visible dot on the horizon just a few minutes ago, now looked like a boulder the size of a hill drifting ever so slowly in the void. Distances in space were so vast it was almost ridiculous. There was still nearly the length of Great Britain separating them from their quarry, yet it seemed so close they could almost touch it.</p><p align="justify">Harry's eyes quickly scanned the display above the main console, picking up several words and numbers among the runic gibberish before he gave his orders.</p><p align="justify">"Program us to match his speed then cut power to the engines and bring out the shields to full. This is a fast one and we don't want to lose it."</p><p align="justify">"Aye, aye."</p><p align="justify">Around him, Cho and Marietta were moving command stones around on the console, executing his order with practised ease. On the sides of the room, Ernie surveyed the readings of the ship's sensors while Katie sat in front of the terminal they were about to activate for the first time, restlessly bouncing her leg in nervous anticipation. Observing their work from the corner of their eyes, Ron and Lee were engaged in the final hand of a game of Exploding Snap while Hermione reviewed her notes on her slate. However, regardless of their duties or distractions, everyone's attention was seized by Ernie's announcement.</p><p align="justify">"Engines are off, we're matching the target and shields are up. We're ready."</p><p align="justify">"Alright. Katie?"</p><p align="justify">Hearing her name seemed to break her out of her trance, as she suddenly rose from her chair to place her command stone on her console.</p><p align="justify">"Finally! Let's see what our baby can do."</p><p align="justify">"Let's not be careless, these systems haven't been used in thousands of years. We should try at a lower charge first then go up little by little." Hermione interjected as she put aside her slate.</p><p align="justify">Lee let out a groan. "Come on, everything else works just fine as soon as we turn it on. And even if there was a problem, the ship would repair itself before we could even see it."</p><p align="justify">Though he was quite curious to see the ship in action, Harry had to admit that Hermione was right, even if she was maybe a bit too prudent.</p><p align="justify">"Nothing lost by being a bit cautious the first time. Power to thirty per cent."</p><p align="justify">"Urgh. Fine." Katie groaned.</p><p align="justify">She turned her command stone before moving it to another part of the console where several runes and circles had lit up. Around them, a low humming started building up as power capacitors as old as mankind began to fill up. New information began to fill their displays as the sound grew in intensity and worried glances were exchanged.</p><p align="justify">"Eeerh, is that normal?" Ron asked.</p><p align="justify">"I don't know..." Ernie said as Hermione came to look over his shoulder. "But the internal sensors are not picking up anything wrong."</p><p align="justify">"Let's continue then. Bring it up to fifty per cent and fire a volley."</p><p align="justify">With a more hesitant hand, Katie dragged her stone upward on the console. They heard sounds of discharge as short bursts of twin blue lights darted by behind the window, disappearing in the distance. They barely had time to admire the spectacle, however, as the humming turned into a shrill whistle and purple writings popped up all over the holographic displays.</p><p align="justify">"Ok, there's <em>no way </em>that's norm-"</p><p align="justify">Ron's observation was interrupted when an explosion rocked the ship and sent them to the ground. Smaller detonations followed quickly, and as Harry clung to the edges of the main console for dear life, his glasses were flung across the room. The lights began to flicker, and panicked voices emerged from their communication stone.</p><p align="justify">"Shut it off! Shut it off!" He shouted to no one in particular, only hoping he would be heard through the cacophony.</p><p align="justify">Later, he would learn that Ernie had managed to reach the weapon console and turn it off. At the moment, however, all he knew was that the chaos ceased as suddenly as it had started and everything just stood still.</p><p align="justify">For a minute, Harry believed he had gone deaf. The shrill still echoed in his ears and everything seemed so quiet compared to the madness they had experienced. He stood there, clinging to the console with trembling hands, his head feeling like it had split open as the deck around him was a mixture of blurry colours and flashing lights. Then, as he released the breath he hadn't even realised he was holding, the shrill began to fade, only to be replaced by moans of pain, the crackling of electricity and footsteps.</p><p align="justify">"Reparo."</p><p align="justify">A flesh-coloured blur was thrust in front of him, and Harry brought his hand to meet it on reflex, only to find his glasses being presented to him. He thanked the orange blur he assumed to be Ron as he put them back on and took in the sight around him.</p><p align="justify">The bridge looked like a hurricane had come through. The furniture had been thrown around, command stones and slates littered the floor and sparks were coming out of consoles and wall panels on the right side of the room.</p><p align="justify">"Everyone ok?"</p><p align="justify">Answers came in the form of groans and mangled swears as his crew got back to their feet or crashed on the nearest chairs and bean bags, more than a few of them sporting cuts and bruises.</p><p align="justify">"Good. Now can someone tell me what the hell just happened?"</p><p align="justify">It only took Lee a moment to drag himself to the main console while holding his left arm close to his chest.</p><p align="justify">"It looks like the power conduits of the starboard cannon blew up somehow. The ship detected that the weapon wasn't getting the power it required and kept sending more in to try and shoot. It only made things worse and the damage spread out throughout the entire conduit."</p><p align="justify">"I thought this wasn't supposed to happen. That there were too many security measures making sure everything was working."</p><p align="justify">Harry tried to not sound angry. It wouldn't solve anything to shout, but it was hard not to when his head was killing him. The fact that he was actually quite furious probably didn't help either.</p><p align="justify">"Of course not. We'll have to investigate but there's clearly something wrong with the sensors in that part of the ship or we would have detected it before it came to that. We may want to check every one on the ship to see if any other is malfunctioning."</p><p align="justify">"So it just didn't show up? That bloody conv-"</p><p align="justify">"Guys? You better come and see this."</p><p align="justify">Once the pain and anger that clouded his thoughts had faded, Harry would be thankful to Katie for stopping him from saying things he didn't really mean. At that moment, however, his head snapped in her direction, the barb on the tip of his tongue dying as he saw her standing in front of the great vaulted windows.</p><p align="justify">Slowly, and without tearing their eyes off the sight outside the ship, everyone stood up and joined her.</p><p align="justify">They had aimed to leave a crater or two on the asteroid, maybe send a projectile through it entirely if it was really powerful. It seemed like they had slightly miscalculated, however, and all they could do now was stand and watch as the myriad of stone fragments that once composed the enormous asteroid were flung into space, like a glorious firework of rocks and dust.</p><p align="justify">It was Ernie who managed to gather the eloquence to describe what they were all feeling at that moment.</p><p align="justify">"Well, shit."</p><hr /><p align="justify">The light of a great chandelier bathed the lavishly decorated office in which Cornelius Fudge sat comfortably with a warm glow. The old ornate clock sitting above the fireplace struck the eleventh hour of Halloween night as he read through another congratulatory letter from one of his many friends, colleagues and donors with a fond smile.</p><p align="justify">It had become customary for him to page through them at the end of this day each year, to remember everything he had accomplished and how far they had come since the war ended. It warmed his heart to read the words of so many good people dedicated to the good of this country, no matter what trouble some agitators tried to stir.</p><p align="justify">A polite knock on the door interrupted his yearly ritual, however, and his brow furrowed as he tore his eyes from the letters. Calynda was out partying until dawn as usual and he was alone in the house.</p><p align="justify">"Who could-"</p><p align="justify">The door opened without waiting for an invitation, revealing the regal figure of Lucius Malfoy, his robes billowing behind him.</p><p align="justify">"Good evening, Cornelius."</p><p align="justify">It took a moment for Fudge to regain his composure as his unexpected visitor sat down across from him as if he was simply settling in to drink a cuppa in his own house.</p><p align="justify">"L-Lucius? What are you doing here so late? Did Nobby let you in?"</p><p align="justify">"I hope you can forgive my intrusion at such a late hour, but it was imperative that I saw you right away. I'm afraid that I have come bearing tragic news." Lucius said, completely ignoring his unwitting host's questions.</p><p align="justify">"Surely we can talk about whatever this is tomorrow?"</p><p align="justify">"Unfortunately, this matter cannot wait."</p><p align="justify">Fudge sat back in his chair with a sigh. Being the Minister has its perks, but it also meant he was the one person distressed people came to in the middle of the night to put down the fires of their idiocy. At least he might be able to get a nice end-of-the-year "bonus" if Lucius needed his help for something...</p><p align="justify">"Very well, I'll have Nobby get us a bottle."</p><p align="justify">"That won't be necessary, Cornelius. We won't have the time to enjoy your collection tonight."</p><p align="justify">Lucius refusing a free glass of fine wine? That was a first. He must really be desperate for his help...which bolstered his hopes for a consequent donation.</p><p align="justify">"What's this about then? You know I'm always ready to help a good friend." Fudge said as he put on his best smile.</p><p align="justify">The one Lucius offered him in return was as charming as ever, but the look in his eyes gave it a more... sinister tone. One of "those" favours then.</p><p align="justify">"I regret to inform you that Sirius Black and an associate of his have been found to be behind the numerous deaths we have seen recently. They hid like rats while plotting their revenge all this time and have come out to finish the work of their master."</p><p align="justify">All pretence of joviality left Fudge at the mention of the murderer.</p><p align="justify">"W-What ? Black? Didn't he flee the country years ago?"</p><p align="justify">"We all know how devious and deceitful he is. I fear his bloody quest for vengeance will bring him to strike against those responsible for his imprisonment."</p><p align="justify">"B-But...That's...This can't possibly be true! I'm the one who brought him in. I <em>testified</em> against that monster!"</p><p align="justify">Fudge's shaking hands crisped around his chair's intricate armrests as his fearful eyes were fixed on Malfoy's, as if to discern some sort of answer in the man's expression. Lucius remained perfectly calm, however, his smile never faded as he played with the head of his cane and continued his explanation as if he were talking about the outcome of the latest quidditch match.</p><p align="justify">"It truly is a regretful turn of events that we did not find this out before the Aurors were called to your residence, my friend. Indeed, while his accomplice was killed as she delayed the Aurors outside of your house, they were too late to save you. When they entered, they found you dead and Black fleeing on a broom with several bottles from your cellar. A shame, really."</p><p align="justify">"What are you talking about?"</p><p align="justify">"Why, of your death of course. You have been a useful acquaintance, and I admit that I will miss our little chats. However, we have reached a point where your death is now more useful than your incompetence."</p><p align="justify">All colours drained from Fudge's face as he finally realised what was happening. His mind reeled at the inconceivable betrayal before his eyes darted to his wand, sitting on the desk in front of him. It could have been in the other side of the country for all the good it did him.</p><p align="justify">His mouth opened and closed several times as he tried and failed to express his shock at the impossibility of the situation. This couldn't be happening. He was the Minister of Great Britain for Merlin's sake. This was just a sick joke of Calynda to punish him for something, right? There was no way...</p><p align="justify">"Goodbye, Cornelius."</p><p align="justify">A flash of sickly green light filled the office, illuminating the well-tended garden and the mangled corpse of Hestia Jones like lightning in a storm before the darkness of the night reclaimed its place once more.</p><hr /><p align="justify">The atrium was abuzz with half-whispered talks as it seemed every single Ministry employee waited uneasily in the crowd amassed before the grand podium. It had appeared overnight at the feet of the fountain and its golden statues, and all but the most recent hires knew that it was only used for the most important announcements. Rumours of the unthinkable had been spread around all morning, and speculations were going wild as everyone seemed to know nothing and everything about what had happened during the night. The exceptional assembly had been called shortly after the start of the day and they had already been waiting for far too long when the great doors opened.</p><p align="justify">A large procession of elderly witches and wizards in plum robes, led by none other than Lucius Malfoy himself, walked in with purpose and spread out in front of the fountain as the man took place on the podium. His grey eyes surveyed the multitude in front of him as the hubbub died out, letting tense anticipation fill the air. A quick tap of his elm wand on the rune inscribed on the podium gave it a soft silver glow and the sound of his solemn voice was carried throughout the atrium for all to hear.</p><p align="justify">"My friends. I am sure that by now, all of you heard of the disaster that struck our country at the crepuscule of our most cherished day of celebration. Our dear Minister was cowardly assassinated by those who wish for the dark days of the war to begin anew."</p><p align="justify">Animated whispers and gasps shook the crowd as Lucius marked a pause, waiting for them to abate.</p><p align="justify">"Cornelius Fudge was both a great man and a dear friend who tirelessly dedicated himself to healing our country after the war, and he will be dearly missed. However, his trust in the better nature of man, while admirable, became his undoing. He let himself grow complacent in his efforts to bring back our normal way of life, and greedy individuals took their chance to sow the seeds of corruption and depravity in our society. Today, those seeds have sprouted and their thorny vines have taken root in the very heart of our nation. Beloved heroes fell from grace and are grasping for whatever power they can while seditious elements try to divide us and take our beloved minister from us. But I tell you my dear compatriots: No more!"</p><p align="justify">"In an emergency session, the Wizengamot has chosen to place their trust and the fate of this country in my hands. They know that I am intimately familiar with the horrors that plagued our past and that I shall do my utmost to prevent them from happening again. As Minister, I shall dedicate my administration to purging the Ministry from its corruption and to bring back proper morale and values into our government. We shall bring a swift and decisive end to those who seek to destabilise our society and our hard-earned peace!"</p><p align="justify">Applause rippled through the audience at his promise. Few of the assembled employees truly understood the implications it brought, and fewer still had the moral decency or goodness of heart to be terrified and disgusted by what they now knew the future would bring.</p><p align="justify">"To prove my dedication to the responsibilities that have been placed upon me, I have already acted my first ministerial order, which has already been approved by the Wizengamot. With it, I aim to begin to right the wrongs of the previous administrations and heal our country's very soul. I have issued a pardon to the victims of the overzealous war-time tribunals when their only crime was to fall prey to the foulest of magics and coercions."</p><p align="justify">The acclamations were more subdued this time, but nonetheless numerous. The menacing glares of the new Aurors in sombre garb guarding the crowd quickly motivated the sceptics to show their appreciation of the motion. This lack of enthusiasm did nothing to dampen Malfoy's excellent mood, however, as he continued his speech, undeterred and dignified as ever.</p><p align="justify">"I know this decision might raise some concerns for some of you, but rest assured, my friends: I only have the best of interests for every true witch and wizard of this country."</p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="justify">The new reforms flowed so quickly and smoothly during the first few weeks under the new administration that one could almost think that they had been carefully planned and prepared well in advance. Such ideas were only entertained in whispers though, as no good and well-meaning member of society could conceive that anyone would have predicted the death of Minister Fudge. If one lent an ear to those conspiratory whispers, however, they would also hear tales of disappearances, and of Aurors drastically increasing their numbers as the Ministry's flying memos took longer to arrive and looked as if they had already been opened.</p><p align="justify">Very few had the time to spare to consider such tall tales, however, as most magical citizens of Great Britain were far too busy focusing on more important matters. One of those was this strange concept called "taxes". Some of the more ignorant of the ways of the world spoke of it like a concept borrowed from Muggles, but those in their right mind knew that the new administration would never stoop so low as to sully their society with such things.</p><p align="justify">As such, these "taxes" on shops and businesses could only be a perfectly well-meaning innovation, meant to strengthen their rebuilding economy. Fortunately for the important people of this country, they were implemented in such a way that only the most recent establishments were obligated to pay exorbitant amounts, and those were almost all owned or frequented by those of less fortunate magical parentage. The older shops had long proved their use for society after all, and should not be troubled by considerations which could interfere with their vital activities. Those who could afford it even had the opportunity to be exempted from these monthly impositions by donating a substantial amount to the ministry's brand-new Integrity and Stability department.</p><p align="justify">Some dissidents were far from sharing those views on the greatness of the new reforms, however, and the topic sparked many heated discussions in Neptune's orbit. It was during one such talk that Voldemort's plan finally became clear to Harry. For months now, he had rooted out any opposition in the Ministry, either by getting them fired or outright murder, while steadily making the life of muggle-borns harder. And now, he had managed in one fell swoop to centralise the wealth of his richest followers, while putting the few shops that were still employing or selling to muggle-borns out of business.</p><p align="justify">It was only a matter of time before the desperate and angry masses decided to take the matter into their own hands and take a stand against the Ministry... Only to be crushed by a brutal and bloody retaliation in the name of peace and stability.</p><p align="justify">The novel experience of knowing what hardship awaited them did nothing to wash away the bitter taste of helplessness and doubt from his mouth.</p><hr /><p align="justify">In the middle of the night, three masked figures draped in dark robes appeared in the deserted alley in front of a renowned wandmaker's shop. Without a sound, they advanced as one and closed its metal curtains with a flick of a wand, hiding the many wands on display from view as the door opened without a sound.</p><p align="justify">Two of the figures disappeared in the shop, and could soon be heard making their way to the apartment above while the last stood guard outside. His gaze surveyed the alley for any undesirable, unperturbed by the muffled sounds of a struggle coming from the door left ajar behind him.</p><p align="justify">When his two companions came back, it was with an unconscious man marked by age and blows, several bags filled to the brim with wooden boxes floating behind him. With but an inquisitive look, answered by a faint nod by the guard, the two turned on their heels and disappeared with a cracking sound that seemed deafening in the dead of the night, taking their prisoner and bounty with them.</p><p align="justify">The last masked figure raised his wand to the door, watching it close and lock, before pointing it down the alley, toward a business owned by a woman well-known for her distasteful views. A dull orange light flashed from the wand and blasted through the door. The storefront exploded in white flames as the figure disappeared as his accomplices had before him.</p><p align="justify">Windows up and down the alley lit up, fearful eyes peering through the gaps of their curtains. The fires roared and burned, climbing to the apartment above and its helpless tenants as none of the onlookers gathered the courage to come out and help, knowing all too well that they risked being next if they did.</p><p align="justify">Those of them deprived of morbid curiosity were quick to turn off their lights, and to go back to huddle in their beds for another sleepless night. Those were the ones who never saw the disparate group of colourful youngsters and grizzled veterans appear in the street and fight off the fire. One of them braved the flames without hesitation to bring back a burned, but living, apothecary out of the collapsing building. And as quickly as they arrived, they were gone, leaving behind them the charred remains of a life's work.</p><p align="justify">Such nights had become an awfully common sight amongst the wizarding settlements of Great Britain...</p><hr /><p align="justify">The nauseating feeling of being squeezed through a spinning straw stopped as his feet touched the carefully waxed floor of Dumbledore's office. Repressing the urge to hurl, Harry leaned on the nearest bookcase and avidly took in great gulps of air. He stood there for an instant, shivering in disgust and soaked to the bones before the heat of the fireplace burning comfortably in the corner washed through his beaten and freezing form.</p><p align="justify">"Next time, we're taking the bus, sir."</p><p align="justify">Next to him, Dumbledore chuckled before bringing out his knobby wand in a wide motion and Harry could feel his clothes peel off from his skin as they promptly dried up.</p><p align="justify">"I'm afraid we will be hard-pressed to find a stop quite near that particular place. Though it might be for the best I suppose."</p><p align="justify">Harry humphed. That was one way of saying it. The cave carved in the face of the tide-beaten cliff was lost in the middle of nowhere. Why couldn't Voldemort hide his Horcruxes in the middle of London or something? At least they wouldn't have to climb down a damn cliff under a downpour. Though knowing him, they'd still have to smear blood on something, like they had to open the cave.</p><p align="justify">Bloody creep.</p><p align="justify">Inside, they had made their way in the dark until they reached a lake filled with hundreds of inferies and a small isle smack in the middle of it. They'd used an invisible boat to go across, only to find a very familiar locket bathing in something that was definitely not water.</p><p align="justify">They had spent a good while inspecting the pedestal and the potion protecting the locket, trying to extirpate it from its aqueous prison or to drain the potion. Conjuring animals to drink it, emptying the goblet on the ground or trying to catch the locket's chain in it... nothing worked. Dumberlore's insistence to confirm the duplicate's nature was met with Harry's firm rejection of drinking whatever cursed potion Voldemort had left here, doubly so if it was to retrieve a fake. They had finally agreed to give up their attempts for the night and to come back with Snape to investigate further at a later date.</p><p align="justify">All in all, the night could almost have been called bearable if the boat hadn't failed them on the way back, plunging them into the freezing waters filled with undead abominations. Getting out of there had been messy.</p><p align="justify">"I hope our failure tonight did not discourage you from joining me for these little outings." Dumbledore said as he pocketed his wand and took place at his desk. His soaked beard and hair and his torn mint green robes brought back memories of him driving back the hordes of undead as they ran for the exit.</p><p align="justify">Despite his tiredness, Harry shook his head vehemently, sending droplets of seawater around him.</p><p align="justify">"Never. I haven't come this far to stop now."</p><p align="justify">"Of course," Dumbledore said with a smile, his eyes full of mirth and pride. "I'll leave you to the careful arms of Morpheus then. I dare say you look like you dearly need it."</p><p align="justify">With a nod, Harry excused himself from the headmaster's office and began his descent of the tower. He felt the excitement of the night drain from his muscles with each step, leaving only a sore tiredness behind. When the gargoyle stepped back to let him out in the hallway, he felt miserable and aching all over, but these feelings paled in comparison to his rebelling stomach. The light dinner he had wolfed down in a hurry before going to see Dumbledore was nothing more than a distant memory by now.</p><p align="justify">He couldn't wait to get back on the ship, or better yet, to the castle's kitchen. However the idea of going down the entire castle in his current state, only to go back up later was unappealing, to say the least. Fortunately for him, he was a wizard, and if he couldn't make his way to the kitchen, he could make the kitchen come to him.</p><p align="justify">A smile came to his lips as memories of his early years in Hogwarts came to mind. Ron would be so proud of his progress.</p><p align="justify">"Dobby?" He asked hesitantly, his voice resonating in the empty corridor.</p><p align="justify">With a crack, a house elf dressed in brightly coloured clothes far too big for him, with his large bat ears covered by gigantic mismatched socks appeared at his side, seemingly unsure if he should look worried or overjoyed.</p><p align="justify">"Harry Potter has called Dobby? It is very late. Students shouldn't be-" He stopped, as his bulging eyes went from the cut on Harry's cheek to his damp hair and singed clothes. "Heep! Is Harry Potter hurt? Dobby will warn-"</p><p align="justify">"Calm down Dobby, everything's fine. I was on a trip with the headmaster and we got caught in the rain, that's all."</p><p align="justify">"Is Harry Potter sure he is alright? Does he need a towel or a blanket or-or-"</p><p align="justify">"It's ok, I'm fine really," Harry said, lowering himself to Dobby's height. "but I could kill for supper right now. Could you bring me some leftovers from dinner, please?"</p><p align="justify">Dobby looked him in the eye, wringing his hands, before nodding. "Dobby can do that, Harry."</p><p align="justify">And just like that, he was gone with a crack, leaving Harry alone in the corridor once again. It was not to last, however, as Harry barely had the time to drop to the floor and prop his back against the wall before Dobby reappeared with a tray in his hands. On it was a mug of steaming hot chocolate and an enormous sandwich filled with ham, lettuce, eggs, sausages, beans, carrots and a dozen other ingredients.</p><p align="justify">On any other day, the combination would have turned his stomach, but tonight Harry was just too hungry to care. Giving his thanks, he took the tray on his knees and wasted no time as he brought the mug to his lips, letting the chocolate goodness spread much-needed warmth inside of him. When he put it down, he realised that Dobby was still looking at him worriedly.</p><p align="justify">"Now that just won't do. Why don't you get yourself something to drink too and join me down here so you can tell me what you've been up to since last year." He said, tapping the spot next to him on the floor.</p><p align="justify">Finally, a tentative smile grew on Dobby's face and, after another quick trip to the kitchen, he sat down next to Hatty with a mug of his own.</p><p align="justify">Being here, chatting with Dobby about nothing and everything, catching up on his life in the castle, offered Harry a much-needed break. It reminded him of life before everything went south before this same little elf told him about the room of requirements and every waking moment turned to the war and how to survive it. It was hard to think that it was all just a few months ago, and staggering to think of all that had changed because he had bumped into Dobby in the kitchen. They had been searching for a place to hide their training from Umbridge and ended up uncovering mankind's greatest discovery since magic itself...</p><p align="justify">His mind came to an abrupt stop as he was about to take another bite out of his sandwich.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>A place to hide? </em>
</p><p align="justify">There's no way it could be this easy, could it?</p><p align="justify">If you needed a place in the castle to hide something and make sure no one would find it... It had been the D.A. for them, but other students could have found themselves with the same problem and ended up with the same solution. Voldemort had hidden his Horcruxes in places important to him, and if there was one thing Harry knew and understood all too well about him, it was that for him, no place was as important as Hogwarts. What better hiding spot could he have found than a room that didn't exist until you specifically asked for it? And in his hubris, he was probably convinced no one else would ever find it.</p><p align="justify">Harry quickly finished his sandwich and, interrupting a tale about missing gloves and feral books in the dungeons, gave back the tray to Dobby with an apology and a promise to see him soon. The elf only nodded before waving him goodbye enthusiastically. He really didn't deserve a friend like Dobby.</p><p align="justify">He scurried himself up and started running, ignoring his aching muscles as he darted through the corridors. The following week, after days spent searching the room with the help of Ron and Hermione, Harry came back to Dumbledore with a sapphire-encrusted diadem locked in a box of pure silver.</p><p align="justify">And if they also sent a few pieces of furniture and knick-knacks to the ship so they could conjure duplicates later, no one had to know...</p><hr /><p align="justify">Far from the boring preoccupations of less interesting people, things were going as usual in the office of Weasleys' Wondrous Innovations. Plans were concocted, inventions were brought to life and candies were made and savoured with relish. The only notable exception that particular day was the absence of Fred's better half, who had no doubt gone to wreak havoc and laughter somewhere else.</p><p align="justify">His absence, however, did not mean that Fred was stumped in his quest for new gadgets and gizmos to devise for the D.S.F. As someone or another probably said at some point, nothing and no one shall stall the march of progress! And speaking of progress, he had just finished the calibration of his newest marvel. Fred put on a pair of protective goggles with hands covered by comically large latex gloves before he pressed a small button on the side of the egg-shaped device and threw it at a wind-up toy in the likeness of a Death Eater across the room.</p><hr /><p align="justify">Today was Saturday, and like every Saturday, Ernie was going around the station, collecting the past week's reports from each division. As he made his way through the section of the ship attributed to engineering, he could not stop himself from frowning at the sizable pile of rolled-up parchments under his arm, as if doing so could make them disappear somehow.</p><p align="justify">While they kept discovering amazing things with every day spent studying alien technology, he couldn't help but think that this part of his job was one big waste of time. After each weekly collection, he spent a non-negligible time skimming through the reports so he could bring the most important or urgent of them to Harry's attention. And while it could be a bit boring at times, learning everything that had been discovered by the crew wasn't a bad way to spend his Saturday nights. No, the real problem was Harry himself.</p><p align="justify">If he hadn't come to know him last year, Ernie would have sworn the man was devoid of any ability to trust other people. He was not satisfied with just hearing Ernie's summary and insisted on being informed of every little detail of everyone's research and discoveries, supposedly so he could supervise and direct them as he thought best for the crew. But in truth, Harry rarely ever gave them such directives, letting them research whatever they fancied or needed as long as they didn't put the integrity of the station and its inhabitants at risk. That was one of the things everyone liked about having him as a captain.</p><p align="justify">No, Harry trusted them to know what they were doing and not to push their enthusiasm too far. And although accidents did happen sometimes, they were always minimised by the security measures they had put in place. It had taken him some time, but Ernie had finally understood the real reason for Harry's obsession with the minutiae of everyone's occupation. He was burying himself under an overwhelming mountain of work to give himself an excuse for not being out there fighting.</p><p align="justify">Even after he had fled to the stars, and despite trying all he could to distract himself from it, the war and its weight had caught back to him. Whether he did it consciously or not didn't matter, as it seemed everyone but him could see it eating him up from inside. The worst part in all of this was how pig-headed he was about it, not letting them help him, or even outright ignoring their advice. Despite his friends' and Ernie's reprimands, Harry slept a lot less these days, trying to catch up on his work and draft plans for their future. Gone was the peace they had seen him find on the ship.</p><p align="justify">Well, if that's how he wanted to go about it, fine. Two could play this game. If he won't let them help him, then they won't give him a choice in the matter. He'd have to talk to the division chiefs about it, but maybe they could find a way to reduce his workload without him noticing what they were doing. Perhaps under the pretence of consolidating the divisions' internal organisation and reducing administrative time that could be better spent?</p><p align="justify">Ernie never managed to think his plans through that day though, as he heard a muffled crackling sound nearby just before the lights across the entire corridor began to flicker. He stopped and looked around in confusion until he noticed the thin smoke coming out of the Weasley twins' lab down the hall.</p><p align="justify">With apprehension, Ernie made his way to the garishly painted door as if it were the gateway to hell itself. He did not fancy finding himself in the middle of one of their jokes gone wrong, but these did not usually affect the station itself. Something was either really wrong or about to be, and he'd better shut them down before they unpressurised the whole section or something.</p><p align="justify">With a press of the control panel, the door began to slide open, only to stop halfway, leaving a diamond-shaped opening from which thick puffs of black smoke came out. Ernie took a step back, coughing as the smoke got in his lungs. He dropped the parchments as he brought a hand to his mouth and twisted his other wrist to take out his wand off the suit's integrated holster.</p><p align="justify">"Ven-" He tried, only for his throat to betray him with a cough. "Ventus!"</p><p align="justify">A burst of wind blew past him and dispersed the smoke, revealing the unconscious form of Fred Weasley. He laid on the floor, behind a worktable while a clearly malfunctioning egg-shaped device flailed around across the room, sending arcs of electricity everywhere. A light fixture exploded as it was hit, sending burning fragments in every direction and causing the ones in the corridor to flicker with renewed vigour.</p><p align="justify">"Crap."</p><p align="justify">While it was true that, in spite of a succession of incompetent teachers, every member of the crew had received some self-defence training during their D.A. days, Ernie would be the first to admit that he was at best a mediocre duelist. It's not like he didn't try, he really did, but he just didn't work well in the heat of the moment. He was more of a peaceful charms kind of guy. Ask him to turn a coconut into a porcelain ballerina, and he'll have it dancing across the room in no time. Charging headfirst toward a crazy machine that zapped and exploded everything around it, however? Not quite his thing.</p><p align="justify">That's why Ernie surprised himself when, instead of running away to get help, he followed his first instinct and dived into the door's opening, taking cover behind a scorched desk. Trying to stop himself from trembling, he began to throw stasis charms in the direction of the offending object. However, as he dared not raise his head above his shelter to aim, his spells all missed their mark by a long shot. He had to bring his arms up to shield himself as another stray bolt of lightning arced above the desk and struck the wall behind him, sending sparks and melting bits of metal all over.</p><p align="justify">Hissing in pain as he felt the heat of the burning pieces penetrate right through his suit, Ernie swirled and swished his wand in a complex motion before taping the desk, turning it into a large rubbery umbrella. He picked it up and tried to make himself as small as possible as he ran awkwardly toward the second desk. Once again behind cover, and with the added protection of the umbrella overhead, Ernie ventured a peek above the desk. This time, his spell struck true while sparks washed up on the rubber above him. The blue light impacted the contraption but failed to do anything to stop its rampage, however.</p><p align="justify">Swearing, Ernie ducked back behind the desk as another bolt struck the floor near him. He chanced another glance at the machine, and now that he was closer to it, he could see the silver and gold inlays swirling around the device's sleek frame.</p><p align="justify">"Had to make it resistant to magic. Of course, he did."</p><p align="justify">He took a deep breath and brought the umbrella closer to him before rising to his full height, his wand slashing the air in precise movements fueled by desperation. The debris lying on the ground near the egg-shaped device gathered and fused into a gaping maw with sharpened teeth.</p><p align="justify">A sharp cry escaped his lips, and his grasp on the umbrella failed him as an arc of electricity shot across the room and impacted his non-wielding arm. He could feel the skin of his arm blister under his suit and his nerves ablaze as his legs collapsed under him and he fell onto the desk.</p><p align="justify">Sprawled amongst parchments, broken inkwells and half-assembled gizmos, Ernie pained to raise his shaking wand for an abrupt upward swish, sending his steel trap to envelop the machine. With the sound of folding metal, the Weasley doomsday device was covered in a sheet of crumpled steel. He had merely bought himself a short respite, however, as he could already see the metal turn red with heat, menacing to melt away in several spots.</p><p align="justify">Out of ideas and with every movement bringing lancinating pain to his left arm that dangled limply at his side, Ernie looked around for something, anything that he could use to finally put an end to this madness. His eyes finally found a large hammer, lying on the ground with every other item that fell when he transfigured the desk they were resting on.</p><p align="justify">When magic fails...</p><p align="justify">Ernie summoned the hammer to him, and let go of his wand to catch it with his good hand before it could crash into him. He dragged himself to the now glowing ball of metal trembling on the floor and fell on his knees before it. Gritting his teeth, he raised his last resort high above his head before slamming it down with all his strength, repeating the motion with reckless abandon until only scraps remained under him.</p><p align="justify">He stood there for maybe a minute, clutching his left arm and waiting for his strength to return. When he finally got back up, his limping gait brought him to Fred's side, and a quick check reassured him that his pulse was still beating, albeit a bit weekly. Ernie gave a deep sigh as he sat on the floor, and brought his hand to his communication stone to call for medical help. This had been entirely too much excitement for his taste.</p><p align="justify">In retrospect, he really should have known not to drop his guard in this particular room.</p><p align="justify">Above him, the lights flickered a last time before settling back to their normal state, and a small square of the ceiling retracted to let out a tube that spewed a blob of rainbow-colored foam. It grew and spread as it touched the floor, putting out the small fire that had started in the device's remains and quickly beginning to fill up the entire room.</p><p align="justify">Swearing like a sailor and with his suit already covered with the stuff, Ernie pushed himself back up and struggled to extirpate Fred from the self-replicating bubbles. Outside, a crowd of onlookers were gathering at the door and some hurried to help them through the opening.</p><p align="justify">As if pursuing them, the foam began to spill out in the hallway, ruining the reports forgotten at their feet. After an uncomfortably soap-filled minute that left many with damp ankles, the foam finally stopped its advance and began to shrink as an over-enthusiastic recording could be heard coming from the room.</p><p align="justify">"Thank you for choosing WWI's unpatented emergency fire suppression system! We hope you'll be more careful next time."</p><p align="justify">It was a good thing Fred hadn't died in the accident because it meant Ernie would be able to kill him himself.</p><hr /><p align="justify">"Remind me why we're doing this again?" Harry asked, making no effort to hide his grumpiness as he'd been woken up at the ungodly hour of eight o'clock a Sunday morning for this.</p><p align="justify">"Because I wanted to see if Seamus's crazy muggle stories about training under a heavier gravity were true," Ron answered way too cheerfully while busying himself with the control panel near the room's entrance. "and because you need to get out of your room more often."</p><p align="justify">They were both standing in the station's training room, dressed in nothing but their suits, which still stuck to them far too much for Harry's comfort and had left off the armoured plating. Soon, the door closed smoothly, making a loud clicking sound as it sealed itself, and the walls began to shine with the soft blue hue of the protective shield.</p><p align="justify">"You're turning into a muscle brain."</p><p align="justify">"Hey! It's my job. The one <em>you </em>assigned to me, need I remind you." Ron exclaimed with a grin. "And at least I'm using my brain. That's got to be an improvement."</p><p align="justify">"Sure is." Harry muttered, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Did you at least check if it was safe with Hermione? Or even Lee?"</p><p align="justify">"Well... I didn't get to ask." Ron said sheepishly. "I tried to bring it up last night but we kind of started arguing about...It's not important" He shook his head and turned to examine the room as if he suddenly found it fascinating. "Anyway, we can just try it out ourselves and see if it works."</p><p align="justify">"I suppose...What do we need to do then?"</p><p align="justify">"Just normal training stuff, for a start." Ron said before tapping his communication stone. "Ernie? You're ready up there?"</p><p align="justify">"Yep. Just waiting for your signal."</p><p align="justify">"Ok, let's start small. Could you give us like...ten times the normal gravity here, please?" Ron</p><p align="justify">"Ten times? Are you sure that's a good idea?" Harry asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p align="justify">"We have to start <em>somewhere</em>."</p><p align="justify">"Well, yeah, but why not two? Or five?"</p><p align="justify">"Relax, mate. From what Seamus told me, they go up to a hundred or something in what he saw on the tilly-vision." Ron said, trying out the unfamiliar word.</p><p align="justify">"Wait, he saw that wher<em>-</em>"</p><p align="justify">Before he could finish, Harry suddenly felt as if his limbs were made out of lead. He couldn't move, let alone lift them, and he quickly found himself on his knees before he crashed down hard on the metal floor.</p><p align="justify">"Me...and my...big...mouth." He heard Ron spit between gritted teeth.</p><p align="justify">Harry tried to turn his head and catch a glimpse of Ron, but the crushing weight kept him pinned down. His entire body felt like Hagrid had decided to take a nap on him, and he could feel his bones pushing down against the rest of his body. Drops of sweat came down his brow, crashing on the floor like bullets. Black spots began to appear in his sight as he struggled to drag a hand to the communication stone uncomfortably pressed against his chest.</p><p align="justify">"Er...nie...stop...now!"</p><p align="justify">He felt his consciousness start to slip, the pressure in his skull becoming unsustainable, when the gravity shifted again, freeing them from the prison of their own weight. Harry rolled around on his back and just stood there for what seemed like hours, his gaze lost in the ceiling and savouring the feeling of the air coming in and out of his lungs without them being crushed. He could hear Ernie's worried questions through the room's speakers and Ron's own laboured breaths, but his brain refused to acknowledge them, preferring to focus on the knowledge that they had both made it.</p><p align="justify">"Next time...you have a brilliant idea like that..."</p><p align="justify">"Yeah...you better...hex it out of me"</p><p align="justify">"Without question...but still...run it through Hermione first."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="justify">There were times when some members of the crew found Harry’s habit of wearing his suit everywhere to be a tad strange. Given the way most magicals dressed themselves, Harry himself didn’t see anything weird with it. It was definitely better than his own clothes, which wasn’t very hard since most of them were Dudley’s castoffs. And it’s not like he didn’t wear anything on top of it.</p><p align="justify">Harry had never been one to pay attention to fashion, though, and the practical side of the suit combined with the fact that he didn’t have to put it on and off twice a day easily won the debate. And most importantly at this moment, it kept him warm.</p><p align="justify">He raised his hand to shield himself from the latest gust of wind that tried to throw another fistful of snow onto his face as he continued to walk up the stairs. The steps were dry, fortunately, as he didn’t fancy falling into the lake from the highest tower in the castle because he slipped on black ice.</p><p align="justify">“Meet me upstairs.” said the note he found in Dumbledore’s office. Was it too much to ask to warn him that said stairs went outside the tower and would leave him at the mercy of the late December Scottish weather? Knowing his luck, he would definitely catch a cold that would force him to bed rest for a week since this was the night before the holidays.</p><p align="justify">Despite his internal complaining, the climb soon came to an end as he stepped on a wide sheltered balcony. One moment he had been battling the wind and the snow, and the next warm air and a soft breeze hit him in the face like a bludger. It was as if he had walked in on a pleasant summer day, exclusively localised on the balcony.</p><p align="justify">“Good evening, Harry.”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore sat comfortably on a swivel chair with a stocking cap on his head, happily knitting with his good hand while the second needle worked by itself. His other hand was hidden under a plaid blanket on which rested the multicoloured scarf born of his handicraft. While the garment was uneven and some knots were clearly far too loose, Dumbledore’s enthusiasm remained intact as he hummed to himself while continuing his work.</p><p align="justify">“You wanted to see me professor?”</p><p align="justify">“Why yes. Take a seat, please, and don’t hesitate to try the scones.”</p><p align="justify">Harry turned his head to see a second swirling chair and a low table which had not been there a moment ago. A steaming teapot with two full cups and an assortment of freshly baked goods had been placed on the table. As he sat down and picked up a cup,</p><p align="justify">Harry took a moment to bask in the balmy atmosphere. He began to drink as he watched the falling snow try to enter the balcony, only to be turned away by an invisible force.</p><p align="justify">The view beyond was simply breathtaking, even for one who had gotten used to the sight of whole planets outside his room’s porthole. The lake and highlands below, covered as they were by a dense blanket of snow, seemed to shimmer under the moonlight as they went on to the horizon. Even the never-wilting trees of the forbidden forest seemed peaceful and not so menacing when the treetops were painted white.</p><p align="justify">"Fascinating thing, knitting, though I’m afraid that even when I had two good hands, I never quite managed to get the hang of it."</p><p align="justify">“I-err-I wouldn’t know sir.”</p><p align="justify">“Do you want to give it a try?” Dumbledore raised an amused eyebrow.</p><p align="justify">Whatever Harry had expected when he had been summoned to the headmaster’s office, this wasn’t it.</p><p align="justify">“It’s... It’s not exactly the kind of thing I like to do in my free time.”</p><p align="justify">“A pity. I do hope you have a hobby or two to occupy your many class-free days, however. I would hate to think you spurned your education in order to be bored all day.”</p><p align="justify">Ok, unsubtle jab and inquiry at his lack of class put aside, this was starting to get weird. He could hardly remember the last time Dumbledore had wanted to talk to him about something else than Voldemort.</p><p align="justify">“I’ve started learning how to bake, actually.”</p><p align="justify">“Did you? You will have to let me try some of your creations then.” Dumbledore smiled contentedly as he continued to work on his awfully long scarf.</p><p align="justify">“It’s not really much at the moment, but... Excuse me, sir, but did you really call me up here to talk about my hobbies?”</p><p align="justify">“Among other things. It occurred to me that we had spent far too much of our time together talking about unpleasant matters and not nearly enough just appreciating each other’s company. I had hoped you would agree to satisfy the curiosity of a meddling old man while we talk about more joyful things.”</p><p align="justify">That was new. Not entirely unwelcome, though.</p><p align="justify">He had spent so much time lately brooding about Voldemort, the war, the D.S.F... More often than not, he even had to cancel his weekly baking session, one of the few times he allowed himself to relax. There was always some urgent report or other development on the ship that needed his attention.</p><p align="justify">And, let’s be honest, this was a far better way to spend an evening than watching more of Riddle’s memories.</p><p align="justify">With his doubts and reservations gone, Harry gladly took a scone with what he guessed to be raspberry jam generously spread on it.</p><p align="justify">“Sure we can. So, I’ve been trying some things with Yorkshire puddings...”</p><p align="justify">And just like that, they began to talk about everything and nothing, exchanging anecdotes both recent and ancient of their time at school. Dumbledore eventually judged his creation to be of a sufficient length and draped himself in it several times over while they watched the last lights of day hide behind the horizon. Despite their valiant efforts, they seemed unable to empty the teapot or finish the various food and sweets that kept appearing on the table.</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore was in the middle of retelling the absurd story of an encounter between a muggle biplane and an Erumpent that supposedly happened in Nepal at the start of the century when they finally noticed the bright stars dotting the sky.</p><p align="justify">“Oh my, so late already? This has been a delightful evening, but I think you should get back to your dorm now, lest you miss your train.” The look he gave him almost made him regret telling him about the start of his second year. Almost.  “I wish you an excellent Christmas, Harry.“</p><p align="justify">“Won’t you be coming to headquarters?”</p><p align="justify">“I will not be able to join you there, unfortunately, but do try to enjoy the holidays. Pardon an old man for rambling if you heard this too many times already, but in these troubled times, we should still take what opportunities we have to see our loved ones and enjoy their company.”</p><p align="justify">He thought of Sirius and Hedwige, waiting for him at Grimmauld place. Of Ron and Hermione, probably bickering about what to bring for the holidays. Of Dobby and Hagrid, who stayed at the castle to care for the students who did the same.</p><p align="justify">“And you sir? Don’t you have anyone you want to see?”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, but I’m seeing them right now Harry.” His brilliant eyes full of mirth turned in his direction as he smiled. ”One of them at least. Other businesses require my attention during the holidays, though I will still go out and drop a gift down my brother’s chimney after you leave. I do have to fulfil my filial duties after all, even if he doesn’t wish to see me anymore.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">Despite Dumbledore’s words of caution at the last feat of the term, most of the crew had elected to leave the castle and spend Christmas with their families. Some, more concerned than others, forwent the train altogether, preferring the more discrete route of the vanishing cabinet.</p><p align="justify">Those few that stayed in the castle, either by choice or because they had nowhere left to go, had taken to decorating parts of the station in an effort to bring some holiday cheer to the austere metal halls. They had even set up an enormous tree in the main observation deck and hung many magical bits and bobs on its branches. Someone had even managed to make small replicas of the Requirement, enchanting them to fly around the room in some sort of aerial ballet.</p><p align="justify">For his part, Harry and the Weasleys had gone back to Grimmauld Place, expecting a sombre Christmas in the disrepaired house, only to find it full of colours and life. While Ms Weasley ran a tight ship in the kitchen and forcefully recruited her eldest sons to help her, Sirius was neck-deep in competition with Kreacher to redecorate the place.</p><p align="justify">Literally.</p><p align="justify">When they arrived, the man had been bound from neck to toe with purple and green wrapping paper. A big black bow completed the ensemble and had the added benefit of tapping his mouth shut, keeping the foulest swears he knew out of impressionable ears.</p><p align="justify">Once freed, he led Harry, Ron and Ginny on a hunt through the house, trying to catch the half-mad house elf. They chased him as he peeled the fresh paint and Christmas lights from the walls, revealing the faded wallpaper and put back the portraits of Black ancestors and tortured muggles to their “proper” place.</p><p align="justify">After nearly a day of running around, avoiding flying furniture and a bad encounter with a cursed wardrobe, they managed to stop his rampage. To keep him out of his hair for the rest of the holiday, Sirius sent him away to sort through the attic’s century-old collections. </p><p align="justify">Harry couldn’t bring himself to blame Kreacher, however. The elf was never really all quiet there, and he seemed to have gone off the deep end since his tantrum a year ago, barely listening to Sirius’s order any more. At least he seemed more happy at his punishment than anything else.</p><p align="justify">Once it was properly lighted and the mounted house-elf heads had been taken down, the place looked downright livable. The holidays were also brightened up by the presence of most of the order, bringing warmth and life into the old home. Tonks and the twins even disappeared at one point, reappearing half a day later with their arms full of party goods. </p><p align="justify">Then began the Great Hat War of 96, where they all tried to find the silliest hat they could in wizard crackers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it quickly devolved into a mad quest to steal and keep hold of the bright pink jester hat Remus had found. Harry felt pretty good about managing to keep it for almost two whole days until Padfoot fell down on him from the bathroom’s ceiling and snatched it.</p><p align="justify">While there were still some tensions, what with Mr Weasley and Percy’s absence, Ms Weasley fusing about Bill and Fleur’s wedding preparations and the ever-present thoughts of the war, it remained one of the best Christmass Harry ever had.</p><hr /><p align="justify">Ron had been the first to notice it.</p><p align="justify">Intent on beating Remus at chess before they went back to school, he had stayed up to study the book on unusual tactics that Hermione had sent him. The rest of them were quite content to simply fall into the warm embrace of their beds after such a long day. At first, he thought he was hallucinating, or that Kreacher was taking advantage of the night to rekindle his crusade. When he heard the muffled cries of pain, however, he knew something was terribly wrong.</p><p align="justify">He shook Harry awake, whispering to him to get up quickly before making his way out of the room, wand in hand. After making sure he wasn’t dreaming, Harry hastened to follow him, only to find Ginny and the twins coming out of their own rooms. With a silent nod, they started their descent toward the kitchen door, behind which the muffled voices were becoming more urgent.</p><p align="justify">As one, they opened it with their wands raised, and Harry became sure that he hadn’t pinched himself hard enough, for the scene in front of them was nothing short of a nightmare.</p><p align="justify">Tonks lay unconscious on one end of the table, her left arm nowhere to be seen and her leg was a mangled mess of flesh, jeans and blood. Remus stood over her, tending to her wounds as quickly as his own allowed him.</p><p align="justify">The blood-covered form of Kingsley sat across the table, his head hanging limply revealing large cuts that marred his face from the remains of what used to be his right ear to the left side of his jaw, barely missing his eye. A haggard-looking Sirius shouted for Ms Weasley as he applied green mucus on the most grievous parts of the wound.</p><p align="justify">Bill and Fleur were tending to each other’s wounds near the sink, and Harry’s eyes quickly passed on the black mass slumped against the wall before he recognized an unbreathing Mundungus Fletcher. </p><p align="justify">Agast and speechless, Harry and his friends let their wand arms falter, petrified on the doorstep by the sight in front of them.</p><p align="justify">“W-what happened?” He asked.</p><p align="justify">The sound of his voice tore Sirius from his frantic ministrations as he finished wrapping bandages around Kingsley’s wounds with swirls of his wand. His usually piercing grey eyes were bloodshot and stained with remains of tears. They jumped between them as he held his wand tightly, relaxing only once he saw Harry. He opened and closed his mouth several times, trying to find his words as his gaze refused to meet theirs. When he finally spoke, his broken voice carried his loss and disbelief.</p><p align="justify">“He... he’s dead. They’re all dead.”</p><p align="justify">However, his voice was quickly drowned by Ms. Weasley’s shrieks as she came out of the basement, arms full of jars of Dittany, potion vials and bandages. “What are you doing here? Out! You shouldn’t see this.”</p><p align="justify">Cries of protest and injustice rose from Harry and his friends, ready to ash out the all too familiar arguments of a now routine dispute. They were immediately cut short, however, as Sirius snapped out of his daze and raised a hand toward Ms Weasley.</p><p align="justify">“Molly. This is <em> not </em> the time!” He growled before turning to them. “Grab bandages and start helping kids, this is going to be a long night.”</p><p align="justify">His words ended up being quite the understatement, as they all spread out around the kitchen to help however they could. Hours later, as they finally managed to clean and bandage the worst of Tonk’s injuries and were preparing to move her to a bed, the dying fireplace burst back to life. The injured that stepped out of the green flames were but the first of the dozen members the Order Harry had never even heard of that came to seek refuge at headquarters. </p><p align="justify">From what he managed to glean while tending to them, they were from semi-independent cells that occupied safe houses all around the country, which were now under attack by death eaters and hit wizards. Those who made it back here were but the lucky few who managed to escape the massacre. The fact that the ranks of the Order had greatly expanded during the last year was news to Harry, but learning of it by witnessing their decimation... Gritting his teeth, he put those thoughts aside and focused back on infusing a bandage with Dittany.</p><p align="justify">The sun was already high and his rays peered through the windows of the drawing room when the teenagers, accompanied by Sirius and Remus, collapsed into its antique chairs and couches. While they rubbed their eyes and took care not to let the antique teapot bite them as it served them tea while floating about, Remus began to recount what he knew of that night’s disaster.</p><p align="justify">“Nymphadora was on a mission for the order, researching a place we suspected to be a Death Eater hideout. We don’t know what happened there, but when she called for help, everyone who could hurried to her... right into a trap.” His voice was barely more than a whisper and his gaze was lost in the burning fireplace. “They were everywhere, hidden in the shadows, the houses... It all went by so fast... When the spells started to rain down on us, we ran for cover, but the next thing I knew, Lenard and Roost were dead. We managed to reach Nymphadora and we made a run for the fireplace while Moody covered us, but...”</p><p align="justify">Like the light in his eyes, his voice died as he let his head rest into his hands while Sirius took over.</p><p align="justify">“They blew him up. I’d bet my wand arm that it was the same damned curse Wormtail used when he framed me. Kingsley, Duncan and Adams were hit too, and I went back with Mundungus to drag them out. I managed to drag Kingsley through the floo, but the others... didn’t make it.”</p><p align="justify">The others...</p><p align="justify">One person had been conspicuously missing that night while the entire order was being decimated. Harry’s voice stuck in his throat as the implications dawned on him. Of the many order members they had seen that night, none displayed a long silver beard. Hermione was finally the one who dared to ask the question they all thought about.</p><p align="justify">“Was... was Professor Dumbledore among them?”</p><p align="justify">He could feel relief course through his body like a cold balm when Remus shook his head as Sirius frowned in contempt.</p><p align="justify">“He wasn’t there. We tried to contact him but-”</p><p align="justify">“Sirius.”</p><p align="justify">“No. You don’t get to defend him. Not for this.” Sirius rose in anger, raising his hand as if to strike him “He left us to die, Remus. We needed him and he wasn’t there and now... now...”</p><p align="justify">His voice died as his arms fell back to his sides. With gritted teeth and a quick stride, Sirius left the room. In the distance, they could hear a door being slammed and the portrait of Wrabulga Black beginning to shriek obscenities before being promptly silenced.</p><p align="justify">When the silence of the grave took back its place in the halls of the house, Remus excused himself and left them to their thoughts. Some drifted back to sleep, huddled together under a blanket, while others whispered about the implications and began to plan for the ever-more uncertain future. Harry, for the most part, just sat there, ruminating on the events of the night as he watched the sunrise through the windows.</p><p align="justify">On the merriest night of the year, like a twisted gift from Voldemort, the Order of the Phoenix was consumed just as it began to rise for the sun. And after seeing the wounded and terrified few that remained, Harry doubted that it would truly ever come back from its ashes.</p><p align="justify">In his tired state, he was only distantly aware of the eerily familiar laughter that echoed deep in his mind and soul, behind a door not quite yet closed...</p><hr /><p align="justify">None of them was surprised when the Daily Prophet failed to report the events of that night. The precious space on the first ten pages wall was filled with far more important and joyous topics. The most prominent was by far the new “Muggle-born Registration Commission”, on which congratulations and new expert opinions were printed daily.</p><p align="justify">It had been announced by Lucius Malfoy during the Ministry’s Christmas reception and had been judged to be a necessary and important step in the betterment of the country’s future. Of course, the fate of those judged unworthy of Britain’s tightening standards was a detail that very few publications dared to even mention.</p><p align="justify">Try as they might, time did not stop its course to let them mourn the loss and the holidays soon came to an end. When the time came and students from the whole country made their way back to the castle, the tables at the first feast of the term seemed emptier than they had been before. The only consolation to be found was that Harry knew some of those missing seats belonged to those they had finally convinced to go into hiding.</p><p align="justify">One of these seats, however, was more worrying, as the high chair at the faculty table remained empty the whole evening. Not in the mood to await another cryptic summon for weeks, Harry let the others go back to the ship after dinner and made his way to the Headmaster’s office, determined to get some answers. His first guess for the password died in his throat when the gargoyle stepped aside as soon as he approached it. He climbed the stairs and passed the ornate door with a swift stride to find Dumbledore sitting at his desk, looking like he hadn’t slept in days.</p><p align="justify">“Good evening, Harry. I thought you would want to rest after your trip, but I find myself once again surprised by the vigour of youth.”</p><p align="justify">His skin was almost as white as his unkempt hair and beard, clashing against the dark circles under his eyes, and looked as dry as parchment. And speaking of parchment, the desk itself was crumbling under the weight of open tomes and scrolls that overflowed down to the ground. The fact that some of the books were muzzled, wrapped up in chains or that one seemed to be bound in human skin was not a good sign, to say the least.</p><p align="justify">As he approached slowly, he could see the scribbles on the parchments move and twist in unreadable patterns. And although he had never taken the class and would be hard-pressed to decipher them, he had seen Hermione do her homework enough time to recognize more than a few arithmantic symbols.</p><p align="justify">“Are you... Are you alright sir?”</p><p align="justify">With a weak smile, Dumbledore began to answer, only to hesitate for an instant as his eyes fell on his blackened hand. With a sigh, he closed the book in front of him and cleared his desk with a swish of his wand. The scrolls rolled themselves up and flew up to the bookcases with the tomes, leaving the desk between them bare of any obstruction.</p><p align="justify">“Of all people, you do not deserve to hear false reassurances. I am old, Harry. Too old to once more wage a war and see dear friends go well before their times because of the greed and madness of the few, most of all mine.”</p><p align="justify">“None of what happened was your fault.” Harry shook his head vehemently.</p><p align="justify">“While I like to believe that I am only partly responsible for the path Tom chose and the birth of Voldemort, I am most certainly responsible for the demise of our friends. That night, I sent Nymphadora to look into one of my leads for the location of a Horcrux. I knew the risks and I trusted in her capability, but I should have been on the lookout for her call...”</p><p align="justify">There were many things Harry wished he could say. Words of reassurance and compassion. Of resentment and accusations. He was their leader, and he had sent them in harm’s way without being here to help them. The fact that none of the members of the Order knew what they were after, what they were dying for, only made this worse.</p><p align="justify">A part of him wanted to scream, to tell him that he was right, that he should have been there and fought with them. The other part though... He could see the regrets etched in every line of his face as if each one was a wound caused by the loss of an old friend. He could not bring himself to condemn the man when he was already down.</p><p align="justify">Trying to put aside the chaos of his thoughts, Harry held on to the question that had burned in his mind since that night, hoping to centre himself around it.</p><p align="justify">“Where were you then? What was so important that you couldn’t be there for them?”</p><p align="justify">In silence, Dumbledore opened a drawer and, with great care, brought out a small vial containing a glimmering silver substance. Harry’s suspicions became a certitude when the pensive gently floated up to the desk and he could feel his anger begin to boil anew.</p><p align="justify">“You let all of that happen just to get another memory of Voldemort?”</p><p align="justify">“Unknowingly, yes. This one has proven to be the single most important I have obtained until now. It took a great deal of persuasion and, unfortunately, some threats and a memory charm to acquire.”</p><p align="justify">Opening the vial, Dumbledore emptied it into the pensive and began to swirl it around with his wand.</p><p align="justify">“Shall we?”</p><p align="justify">With a dubious glance at Dumbledore and still unsure of how he should feel about all of this, Harry followed his lead and plunged his head into the stone bowl.</p><p align="justify">In the puzzling, but nonetheless illuminating, exchange between Tom Riddle and Slughorn that they witnessed, they found the last piece of Voldemort’s mad puzzle.</p><p align="justify">Seven.</p><p align="justify">The madman had torn his soul seven times. How could anyone willingly mutilate themselves to that extent? And not just once, but <em>seven</em> <em>times</em>? Or six, if Dumbledore’s theory that he died as he tried to make the last one was right.</p><p align="justify">The revelation was enough to drag Harry out of his hesitation and they soon began to talk about the possible nature and hiding places for the remaining two items. While one still eluded them, a great many clues Dumbledore had gathered soon gave them some certitude as to the last one. </p><p align="justify">Nagini, the snake. The one that never left Voldemort’s side.</p><p align="justify">Why couldn’t they have all been easy?</p><hr /><p align="justify">As the new term began and the crew settled back into its now familiar routine, the much-awaited Apparition lessons were announced for those nearing the required age. Every crew member that was sixteen years old and above threw themselves at the practice with a determination rarely seen by the examiners. Angelina and Cho even organised additional lessons on the station for those who felt they needed the extra practice.</p><p align="justify">While they had little regard for the Ministry’s approval and the obtention of a licence, Apparition was one of the most useful magic a wizard or a witch could master. Doubly so when you were out in space. Their disregard for the legal formalities was quickly vindicated when they met the instructor sent by the Ministry. </p><p align="justify">The man was far from inclined to allow unimportant concepts like professionalism or impartiality to get in the way of his job and was all in all just a sycophant. While Malfoy and his ilk received special attention and even dispensations to take the exam before they turned seventeen, every single muggle-born and known sympathisers failed their final examination.</p><p align="justify">That is not to say all his decisions were politically motivated, however, as some were rightfully rejected. Dean, for example, came out of the great hall with a missing fingernail. The examiner seemed to find something wrong with almost every one of them, however, going as far as inventing missing body parts on them. Hermione had been incensed after he failed her for “missing some hair in that nest of hers”, only to give Goyle a passing grade when he reappeared without all his toes.</p><p align="justify">Ignoring the screwed official judgement, a bit over half of them had reached a point when they could apparate without splinching by the end of the lessons. They didn’t let that stop them, however, and still held their own lessons for those who needed more time to master it. Just in case, though, Harry sent Clarissa and Pryden to purchase as many healing potions as they could from an apothecary in Bristol, since the one on Diagon Alley wasn’t an option anymore.</p><p align="justify">With the enthusiasm of first years who discovered the tickling jinx, most of them began apparating everywhere aboard the ship and station. It came to a point where Harry had to step in and ban them from doing it anywhere near the laboratories and sensible areas after one too many nearly-avoided accidents. Apparating was free game out in space, however, and it made moving around in the absence of gravity much easier.</p><p align="justify">Not a week after he was deemed adept at it, Seamus had the bad idea to try and reach Mars by apparating. The far greater distances and the lack of landmarks, or anything really, to properly visualise their target location made the endeavour hazardous at best, and downright deadly at worst.</p><p align="justify">He had been incredibly lucky that they managed to pick up his suit on the ship’s sensor to rescue him after he fainted from exhaustion after having travelled a hundredth of the distance. Even more fortunate was the fact that, despite the hazardous limitations to determine the three Ds in space, he had managed not to splinch and tear a hole in his suit. Though of course, Seamus had claimed that just served to show how good he had become at apparating.</p><p align="justify">All his boasts did not help him when Harry came looking for him after that, however, and he tried to put as much distance between them as his new “mastery” allowed.</p><p align="justify">He did not make it far enough.</p><p align="justify">On the plus side, the frontal hull of the Requirement had not been this clean in millennia.</p><p align="justify">Still, going outside the ship to practise moving in low gravity with newfound ability was as good an excuse as any to leave their worries behind for a few hours and just have some fun. They decided on a late afternoon lunar outing and parked the ship behind the moon to make sure no one from Earth could see it. It wouldn’t do to come back to Hogwarts to discover that they had been spotted during that day’s astronomy class.</p><p align="justify">After a short practice session, the crew was given free quarters and they began to jump around gleefully. They tried out all sorts of stunts and found increasingly outlandish ways to send each other flying. After a while, all but the most turbulent of them began to calm down. Some made a trip back to the ship to bring back their quidditch equipment and a pickup game without brooms or hoverboards started in a small crater. Others were content to sit and chat under the breathtaking view of the Earth being slowly bathed in the light of the rising sun.</p><p align="justify">In one such group, some began to wonder about their place and that of others in the galaxy.</p><p align="justify">"I mean, It's one thing to think of Centaurs or Goblins, but real aliens? From across the universe?"</p><p align="justify">“I doubt they come from that far. They’re most likely from another part of the galaxy, one we haven’t charted yet or astronomers would have seen them.”</p><p align="justify">"Yeah, that’s a thing too. We’re the first people on Earth to have actual proof that they exist.“</p><p align="justify">"Oh no, we’re not the first. Muggles know <em> all </em> about them.”</p><p align="justify">“Wait, really?”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t think-”</p><p align="justify">”Well, their ministries do, at least. My father wrote about it in the past. Muggles have been conquered by aliens years ago, you see. Now, they try to prepare the masses with stories and movies before revealing the truth and serving their unsuspecting populations to their alien overlords."</p><p align="justify">“Then why haven’t we heard about them before?”</p><p align="justify">“Because the Nigerian and Swedish Ministries are already in their hands and covering up the truth, of course. I’m quite surprised that they haven’t found us out yet, actually. They would have sent their agents to silence us.”</p><p align="justify">Not far from there, Harry, Ron and Hermione found themselves apart from the rest of the crew, laid out on a crater slope. After the sombre mood of the holidays, just sitting here with the two of them as they talked and laughed was a true breath of fresh air. He wanted to enjoy it for as long as he could.</p><p align="justify">So what if the low gravity was beginning to make him feel sick? He was exactly where he wanted to be, laughing at a joke Ron had just butchered and he would stay as long as he could. They were content to watch the Earth above them as it turned among the stars.</p><p align="justify">“I know we’re not supposed to leave too many traces of our passage, but I wonder if we could find the moon landing site. We would have to be careful not to touch anything, though.” Hermione thought aloud.</p><p align="justify">“Forget that, if we go looking around the moon, I want to find Merlin’s cauldron.”</p><p align="justify">“Merlin’s what?”</p><p align="justify">Hermione’s question mirrored Harry’s raised eyebrow. While he had picked up a lot of things about Merlin since he came to Hogwarts, this was the first he had heard about a cauldron. Granted, “Merlin’s saggy bollocks” didn’t have much to teach in the sense of historical value, but still.</p><p align="justify">“His cauldron? The one he used to brew Arthur’s antidote?”</p><p align="justify">“I’ve never heard anything about that anywhere.” Hermione scowled. ”It’s not even mentioned in his biography.”</p><p align="justify">“With Binns teaching History? Not surprising.” Ron said with a large grin on his face. It was not every day that he managed to teach Hermione something, and he relished every one of these occasions. ”When Morganna cursed King Arthur to wither in eternal sleep, Merlin came up here. He’d gathered some rare ingredients and a special cauldron to extract the full power of the lunar cycle to make an antidote that cured Arthur from the curse.”</p><p align="justify">“That sound... Improbable, but it’s true magic can sometimes be like that.”</p><p align="justify">“Well, it’s true. Thing is though, after he gave it to Arthur and it got rid of the curse, they found out that it kept healing him of every wound, disease and even death. Merlin judged it to be too powerful for anyone to have, so he took back the antidote from Arthur and hid the cauldron so no one could make it again.”</p><p align="justify">“Sounds like the Philosopher’s Stone. We sure could use something like that these days...”</p><p align="justify">The silence that fell on them this time was not a merry one. Ron’s posture slumped as Hermione came to rest a hand on his shoulder. Their opaque helmets made it impossible to see his expression, but they didn’t need to. Harry felt his own guts churn at the thought of Mr Weasley, still trapped in stasis at St Mungo's with no hope of ever being cured.</p><p align="justify">“Ron. I-”</p><p align="justify">“Captain? I think we have a situation.” Susan’s voice interrupted him as it came to life in his helmet.</p><p align="justify">Of all the damned times...</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p dir="ltr" align="justify">“And you haven’t experienced any other symptoms aside from the nausea?”</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">“For the last time, no, nothing. Are you done yet?”</p><p align="justify">The look Susan gave him made it clear just how unimpressed she was with his desire to leave as quickly as possible. Not that it mattered to Harry though, he’d ended up in Mme Pomfrey’s care often enough to learn to ignore it.</p><p align="justify">“You know, if you’re going to be the ship’s doctor, you could at least work on your bedside manners”</p><p align="justify">“If I’m going to be the dedicated healer of this ship, I’d like for you to let me do my job. You may be the captain, be in here, you’re just another patient.”</p><p align="justify">All around them, the room they had begun to turn into an onboard infirmary was filled to the brim with sick crew members. Almost everyone had fallen sick one way or another after their little lunar excursion and the relatively small room had quickly overflowed with patients. Those with the most severe symptoms had been eased onto the few beds they had while the others were sent back to their quarters after they had been examined.</p><p align="justify">In the corner of the room, he could see Dean plunge his upper half into the enchanted trunk he used to store their supplies of medicinal potions. As he emerged with his arms full of vials, his pale complexion and the slight tremor of his hands seemed even more pronounced than they had the last time Harry saw him just a few minutes earlier. He had tried more than once, unsuccessfully, to make him stop and rest like the others. Nothing seemed to convince their other healer in training to take care of himself when others needed him.</p><p align="justify">Well if he was going to be stubborn, two could play this game. Staying put and doing nothing while others worked had never been Harry’s strong suit anyway. He jumped down from the examination table he was sitting on and put the top half of his suit back on while glancing at Susan.</p><p align="justify">“So, any idea about what’s going on? If we all caught some sort of space disease, we can't let anyone go back to Hogwarts until it's gone.”</p><p align="justify">She sighed as she put down the slate she was holding and leaned on the table.</p><p align="justify">“We’re not sure yet. The nature and intensity of the symptoms vary from one person to another, so we can’t pinpoint the exact cause. So far we’ve had people complaining of fever, nausea, vomiting, headaches, vertigo... The list is growing by the hour.”</p><p align="justify">Her traits were drawn and he could still see the numerous vials of pain relievers he had seen her drink through the night. The sooner this was all over, the sooner he could order them all to bed.</p><p align="justify">”We’ve seen some improvement in most of the patients after some general care and bed rest, but we can’t go beyond that without knowing exactly what we’re dealing with. Administering the wrong treatment could worsen the symptoms for all we know.”</p><p align="justify">“Not much to do than keep looking, then. I’m sure you’ll find out soon enough.”</p><p align="justify">From the speed at which she turned toward him with a frown, he knew he must have said exactly the wrong thing. How did he always manage to get on the bad side of the people responsible for keeping him in one piece?</p><p align="justify">"We're lucky that it seems like nothing too serious happened this time, but it won't always be the case.”</p><p align="justify">“Well, yeah but-”</p><p align="justify">“We need a real healer.” She interrupted him, shaking her head. “With so many of us experimenting all day with alien stuff, it’s a wonder no one has lost an arm yet. Relying on two students doing the bare minimum after a few weeks of light tutoring and praying for the best is a recipe for disaster."</p><p align="justify">“I know, we’re working on it. We need to be careful with the people we bring in on this, and these things take time. Can’t you use the alien stuff to make do in the meantime? There’s got to be medical equipment in here.”</p><p align="justify">“You’re kidding, right? We’re still cataloguing everything on the ship and browsing a computer library the size of London.” She picked up a nearby device with a cylindrical shape and protuberances on both ends, abruptly bringing it up right under his nose. ”For all we know, this thing could be used to detect problems with your spleen, or it could rearrange your insides to whatever is normal for aliens.”</p><p align="justify">“Probably best not to put it in people’s faces then.” He slowly pushed down the offending gadget before he took it out of her hand and placed it on the table. Susan offered no resistance, her exhaustion catching up to her as her expression softened.</p><p align="justify">"I know you want to protect us, but we can't do all of this ourselves. We haven't even finished school yet and now we have to learn completely different things. Amazing and wonderful things, but it will take time. Until then, the mistakes we make along the way can have real consequences. Especially if..."</p><p align="justify">Her voice faltered for an instant, before she clenched her fists, took a deep breath and raised her head to look him in the eyes, brimming with determination.</p><p align="justify">"<em>When </em>we fight against You-Know-Who, it's gonna be a lot worse."</p><p align="justify">"Some of us don’t exactly have a choice in the matter, and we will have to fight. But not everyone-"</p><p align="justify">"Don't." She raised her index to his face, as she would a wand ready to unleash a deadly spell. "Don’t you dare. This is our fight as much as yours. You're not the only one to have lost your family to these... to these monsters."</p><p align="justify">“I...”</p><p align="justify">There are many things he could have said. Many half-hearted arguments, sensible reasons and reasonable alternatives he could have brought up. But since when did any of them do the logical things? When you were a magical teen caught between a terrorist government and a spaceship while still going to class every Thursday, logic was the last thing you cared about. </p><p align="justify">And with every sick friend and acquaintance filling the room standing as shining beacons of how right she was... He couldn’t bring himself to rebuke her.</p><p align="justify">Especially since, deep down, he knew she was right.</p><p align="justify">And he really didn’t want her to point something at his face again.</p><p align="justify">“Alright, I get it. I’ll see what I can do, ok?”</p><p align="justify">“Good. And don’t you forget it.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">The soft whirring and buzzing of various devices and half-finished inventions that filled Lee’s office could be heard even before he opened the door, but it was at least expected. What wasn’t, was that the room looked like a tornado had ravaged the place since he was last here. Large sheets of parchment covered in schematics, schemas and equations had been scattered around as if it was the latest hit in home decoration. On the large desk occupying the middle of the room, a suit lay half-dismantled while the missing parts had been thrown around haphazardly.</p><p align="justify">Neither Lee nor the Wesley twins seemed bothered by the mess, however, as they continued to argue in front of a large whiteboard covered in scribbles and drawings of a suit. They seemed so engrossed in their quarrel, battling to be heard or for ownership of the only marker, that they did not hear the faint hiss of the door. For a second, Harry was tempted to let them continue, just to see how long it would take them to notice his presence. Unfortunately, the night itself had already been far too long for him to indulge in anything that would delay his reunion with the soft sheets of his bed anymore.</p><p align="justify">He stepped into the room, putting enough strength into his steps for them to be heard by the squabbling trio.</p><p align="justify">“Guys. Care to tell me what’s this all about?”</p><p align="justify">As one, the three stopped and turned toward him, looking like deer in headlights. Their surprise only lasted an instant, however, and they soon gathered their bearings. Fred crossed his arms with a sour look while George sheepishly started to rub his neck and looked everywhere but at him. Lee, for his part, gave an exasperated sigh that Harry would have happily echoed.</p><p align="justify">This was off to a great start.</p><p align="justify">Just as Harry opened his mouth to press them for answers, George’s lips seemed to unsew themselves and the words flew like arrows.</p><p align="justify">“It’s our fault! I swear, we thought everything was fine, we did a lot of testing, but we hadn’t-”</p><p align="justify">“What are you talking about?”</p><p align="justify">"The whole sickness thing... It's our fault."</p><p align="justify">That... Wasn’t what Harry was expecting. The admission seemed to sour Fred’s mood even more, however.</p><p align="justify">"We couldn’t have known. We’re only responsible in the sense that we failed to prevent it."</p><p align="justify">"It’s <em> still </em>our fault."</p><p align="justify">“We can’t be held responsible for not knowing everything!”</p><p align="justify">“That’s not the point and you damn well know it.”</p><p align="justify">Harry could feel the irritation simmering in his blood flare at the bickering contest flaring up once again in front of him. With half the crew still stuck in the infirmary and the last echoes of his own nausea making him feel like he was about to throw up, he had very little patience to spare at the moment. Still, he forced his voice to stay levelled, keeping all hints of his annoyance from it. Shouting would help no one right now.</p><p align="justify">"Guys, focus. Why is it your fault? Did you slip us all one of your jokes sweet?"</p><p align="justify">Fred and George stopped squabbling mid-sentence and exchanged a few glances as if silently discussing what they should say without managing to agree on something. Next to them, Lee gave them a look of his own, thoroughly unimpressed, but seemingly unsurprised. He most likely has seen them like that more than a few times over the years.</p><p align="justify">They seemed to finally find a compromise as they started talking again, albeit with clear reluctance.</p><p align="justify">“It’s not like that...”</p><p align="justify">"Yeah, that would have been much better."</p><p align="justify">"None would have been in danger then."</p><p align="justify">“Now, it wasn’t <em> that </em> ba-”</p><p align="justify">"It was a flaw in the suit.” Lee interrupted, frustration clear in his voice. ”When we conjured them, we had to enter quite a few environmental parameters, including the amount of radiation they could shield us from.”</p><p align="justify">Finally, a straight answer.</p><p align="justify">“I remember. But I thought you guys took care of it?”</p><p align="justify">”We did!” Fred piped up. “The suits work perfectly and they <em> do </em>protect us from radiations, thank you very much.”</p><p align="justify">”As long as you’re not exposed to the enormous quantities that permeate deep space or stay in them too long." George grumbled as he sent an accusatory look to his twin. “We prioritised the ease of movement and comfort since we thought the armour platings would be enough protection.”</p><p align="justify">"Now hold on, why is it only becoming a problem now? We've gone out of the ship plenty of times before, and no one fell sick like that."</p><p align="justify">"Because we were protected without even knowing it. Here, I'll show you." </p><p align="justify">Lee summoned one of the sheets of parchment and inkwell that were lying around the room and took out his quill. He spread it out on a nearby console and quickly drew a rough sketch of Earth, the moon and the sun. He then added small waves coming out of the sun in every direction, dotting the parchment with small blots of ink in his haste.</p><p align="justify">"It's a gross simplification, but the sun is like a giant continuous nuclear explosion, releasing an insane amount of radiation into space.” He added two rounded half-circles around the earth, joining the two poles. “Now, the Earth and its atmosphere are protected by a magnetic field generated by the planet's core-"</p><p align="justify">"Just like the shield on the ship, protecting us from all the bad stuff space throws at us." George supplied.</p><p align="justify">"Exactly. Every time we went out, we stayed close enough to a planet or the ship to be protected by these shields. That greatly reduced the amount of radiation the suits were taking in and we never stayed out too long anyway. We even built the station close enough to Neptune that it is inside its field. This time, however..."</p><p align="justify">"The moon is too far away. It's not in the field." Harry nodded in grim understanding as he looked at the drawing.</p><p align="justify">"Bingo. And it doesn’t have one of its own."</p><p align="justify">Knowing what happened was all well and good, but the churning in his stomach reminded Harry of the more important question here.</p><p align="justify">"Alright, but do you know if we are going to get sicker?"</p><p align="justify">Harry vividly remembered a man burned by radiation in a movie Vernon watched, years ago. He could only see a part of the telly through the openings in the cupboard's door, but the sight remains engraved in his memory to this day.</p><p align="justify">"We should be ok. We’re not sure if magicals are more resistant to radiation or if we weren't exposed long enough for serious damage to be done, but Susan told me that even the sickest patients are well on their way to recovery the last time I checked."</p><p align="justify">"That doesn't mean we can ignore this going forward," George announced, a bit of his usual cheerfulness coming back.</p><p align="justify">"And that's why we're gonna work on a new version of the suits that'll let us go out in deep space safely."</p><p align="justify">“Might be a bit bulkier though.”</p><p align="justify">“As long as we don’t die while taking a stroll, I’ll consider it a win.”</p><p align="justify">With the twins perking up, the weighty mood of the meeting was lifted and they talked for a while longer of their plans going forward. There was still so much they didn't know about this new environment where no wizard had gone before, just like the ship itself. They were still unsure what half of the consoles did, and they had only managed to access and translate a small portion of the enormous databanks of the ship.</p><p align="justify">Hopefully, they wouldn’t kill themselves by accident before they could figure it all out.</p><hr /><p align="justify">“Harry! Harry, a moment please!”</p><p align="justify">His blood froze in his veins and his feet stopped mid-stride at the call. This day had been going so well before that. Just another normal Thursday where the only dark cloud should have been his morning class with Snape. The daily routine he had fallen into had finally betrayed him to complacency and nothing could have prepared Harry for Him.</p><p align="justify">With a look and a nod, he told his friends to go on ahead and leave him to his fate. He could see the look in their eyes, how they hid their derision behind a thin veil of concern. Well, except Ron of course. The traitor was smirking at him, barely containing a laugh and taking delight in his plight as they resumed their march up the stairs.</p><p align="justify">Left alone to face the coming enemy, Harry closed his eyes and took a big breath to steady himself. Gathering both courage and patience, he turned around a crisped smile on his face.</p><p align="justify">Merlin knew he was going to need both of those things if he was to deal with this today.</p><p align="justify">“Good afternoon, professor.”</p><p align="justify">“Harry, my boy! Just the man I was looking for.” Horace Slughorn announced with his usual exuberant cheerfulness as he reached the stair landing below Harry. “I hope you are doing well.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m... fine, sir.”</p><p align="justify">“Good, good. I hope I’m not intruding on your free day. Then again, you do have a lot of those this year, don’t you?” Harry could only stare as Slughorn gave him a knowing smile and a complicit wink.</p><p align="justify">“I-”</p><p align="justify">“Still. Quite the luck that I bumped into you now. You are an awfully hard man to find, you know? If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you spent your days away from the castle!”</p><p align="justify">“I’m just... busy. With homework, helping out the quidditch team, and... and everything else. You know how it is.”</p><p align="justify">“Quite, quite. But any longer and I would have begun to think you were avoiding me.“</p><p align="justify">That... wasn’t completely inaccurate. One might even say it was the complete truth of the matter. Ever since he attended the one on board the Express, Harry had been doing his best to avoid him and his invitations to the “little gatherings” of his club as much as possible. And although there had been a few times when his excuses had been more than a little flimsy, he had so far managed to escape the man’s insistence.</p><p align="justify">“Still, I digress. I wanted to invite you to a little party I’m organising this Saturday to celebrate the new term. Many of your classmates will attend, and it will be a good opportunity to get your mind off the schoolwork that keeps you so busy.”</p><p align="justify">Around them, a few students had stopped around the stairs, watching his complete lack of social grace like dogs would a butcher preparing them a treat. Two younger Slytherins in particular seemed far too interested in the situation for his rapidly dwindling patience and failed miserably to conceal their eavesdropping.</p><p align="justify">This was just great.</p><p align="justify">“Actually, I already made plans with my friends for this week-end, sir.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m sure they can manage without you for a night. And you can still see them the rest of the weekend. This is an opportunity you shouldn’t pass on. I’m sure everyone will be thrilled to see you since you have been such a rare sight these days.”</p><p align="justify">Could they manage the flight training without him? Cho knew the flight path and he trusted her not to try anything too dangerous, but the idea of not being there in case things went wrong just didn’t sit right with Harry. Unfortunately, he didn’t even get a chance to refute him before Slughorn launched himself into an impassioned sales pitch about his club.</p><p align="justify">“Since it is the first one of the year, I wanted to go all out. Peter Dwinkley and Florence Robert will be there, you know? They’re chasers for the national team. It’s a shame they couldn’t play last season because Ireland wouldn’t have stood a chance, let me tell you. And let’s not forget Archibal Swansforth, the head of the Sanctimus Price ward at St Mungo’s who-”</p><p align="justify">He could feel the gazes of the amassing audience burning through him as Slughorn droned on about the merits of his party and guests until, finally, he cracked.</p><p align="justify">Slughorn wanted him to go? Fine then, he’ll go. For the first and last time. At least then he would be able to shut him up quickly the next time by telling him how bad it had been.</p><p align="justify">“I’ll come, sir. I’ll have to talk to my friends, but I’ll come.”</p><p align="justify">“Fantastic! I look forward to seeing you there this week-end by boy.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes... Great. Now if you’ll excuse me...”</p><p align="justify">“Oh right, right, of course. Don’t let little old me hold you. And don’t forget not to overwork yourself!”</p><p align="justify">Harry was gritting his teeth as climbed the stairs with heavy steps. Surrounding him were the mocking looks and snickers of his impromptu audience and the sound of two children running away down one of the corridors...</p><hr /><p align="justify">The hot air that blew in his back was the only warning Harry got before a wave of flames came crashing down upon him. Reacting on instinct, he twisted on his heels and reappeared a few metres away with a loud cracking sound. Before he could even take a breath, however, the pavement all around him began to turn into metallic spikes, ready to impale him.</p><p align="justify">Harry brought up his wand above his head in wide circles, willing into existence a wind that grew in strength as he did. The quickly forming tornado drew in its current the growing spikes, tearing them from the ground and pulling them in the air. Bringing down his wand with a swish, Harry broke the pattern to send the gust and its deadly charge toward Ginny.</p><p align="justify">Not one to be taken down so easily, Ginny tore the wall of the nearby building and brought it in front of her, just in time for the first spikes to hit and pierce halfway through it. Confident in her rapidly breaking wall, Ginny stabbed the air with her wand before twisting it. A thick smoke burst from it, quickly engulfing her surroundings and hiding her from Harry’s sight.</p><p align="justify">Lately, Harry’s workload had lightened to the point where he found a lot more free time than he knew what to make of. Whether it was because they were starting to slow down in their discoveries about alien technology, or because they reorganised themselves to make the divisions more independent as Ernie suggested, he didn’t know. He certainly wasn’t complaining, though.</p><p align="justify">Gone were the nights spent hunched over a never-ending pile of reports or pondering the planning of the crew’s various divisions. Sure, there were always more runes to learn and unused parts of the ship to explore, but he far preferred to spend his time training with Ron and the rest of the combat team.</p><p align="justify">At least it gave him the impression of actually doing something in this war while Dumbledore searched for the remaining Horcruxes.</p><p align="justify">Standing in the middle of a road torn asunder, Harry listened and watched his surroundings carefully, trying to pick up the slightest hint of Ginny’s presence. The crackling of the fire and the clouds of dust and smoke left by their latest bout made the task difficult, however. The sting of the bruises and burns that covered his body didn’t help either, but he hadn’t been hurt to the point where he couldn’t just ignore the pain.</p><p align="justify">He sent a blasting curse to his left as he heard the sound of a rock rolling on the pavement, only to shout in pain as a cutting curse sliced the back of his shoulder. He raised his wand as he ran for cover, manifesting a glowing shield that flared when another curse hit it. As he jumped behind a low garden wall, Harry sent another basting curse in the general direction of the attacks but only succeeded in raising more dust in the air.</p><p align="justify">Harry reached for the little pouch at his hip and brought out a vial filled with a brightly yellow and viscous substance. The pouch was slightly singed, but overall undamaged by the violence of the fight, courtesy of Parvati’s insight of adding strands of gold and silver in the threads. The same could not be said of his muggle clothes, however. The oversized hand-me-downs looked like he’d walked through a war zone. </p><p align="justify">Though he supposed he had, in a sense.</p><p align="justify">Gritting his teeth, Harry poured the vial’s content on his hand and spread it on his wound, igniting a fire in the flesh as it mended itself. He gave himself a few moments to recover before chancing a glance above the wall, ducking back down when he was almost immediately greeted by a stunner. He was about to try and crawl along the wall when Ron’s voice boomed through the village.</p><p align="justify">“Alright, that’s enough hiding. Assume enemy reinforcements are coming. You need to finish this <em> now </em> and escape.”</p><p align="justify">Months ago, when their studies of the ship had turned into an actual organisation, Harry had relinquished the tutoring role he had when they were still just a study group. As captain, he simply couldn’t give their new combat team the time they needed to prepare and oversee their training sessions. The transition had worried him slightly in the beginning, because although he trusted Ron to step up and take care of things, the same could not be said of Ron himself.</p><p align="justify">At first, he had come to him often, asking for advice or brainstorming ideas on the best ways to teach one subject or the other, trying his best to become the teacher Harry had been to the D.A. That wasn’t what Harry wanted though. Nor was it what they needed. They weren’t preparing themselves for exams anymore, and Ron had to find his own way of doing things instead of seeking to fill a role that wasn’t his.</p><p align="justify">With time, practice, and one near hit too much during training, Ron had cracked down on his squad. Gone were the hesitant tutoring sessions that mirrored the days of the D.A. His new exercises and drills were a lot closer to what Harry would expect to find in the army. Ron had found more confidence in his own ideas and begun to experiment, progressively developing his own teaching style and expecting in return more discipline and rigour from his team.</p><p align="justify">Today’s session was focused on one-on-one duels without their suits, a scenario Ron insisted was necessary since they wouldn’t always be able to rely on them. The lack of technology did nothing to hamper them, however, as neither Harry nor Ginny were holding back. Their fight was a brutal one, using their spells using the environment to their advantage with no regard for the conjured replica of Hogsmeade that served as their battlefield.</p><p align="justify">Swearing as he pushed himself off the ground, Harry brought another shield to life as he saw Ginny jumping down from a roof across the street. From her dishevelled look and the way she favoured her right leg, one of his latest curses must have been a close miss.</p><p align="justify">He stepped over the low wall as he sent one hex after the other in Ginny’s direction, watching her own shield flash in increasingly dimming lights as they splashed harmlessly on it. Determined to end this, he brought back his wand, raising it in preparation for a more powerful spell that would break the shield and finally end this fight.</p><p align="justify">Ginny wasn’t just going to stand there and allow him to rain down spells upon her unpunished, however. He heard a wet sound behind him, and a quick look revealed that the garden wall had become a wave of greyish water rapidly advancing in their direction.</p><p align="justify">This was going to be close.</p><p align="justify">“Magnus Fulgur!”</p><p align="justify">“Accio!”</p><p align="justify">Completing the wand movement, a great bolt of lightning crossed the distance between the two of them and shattered Ginny’s shield. As the sound of rushing water grew too close for comfort, Harry’s eyes widened as he saw one of the conjured metal spikes floating near an unscathed and smirking Ginny Weasley. </p><p align="justify">When the water licked his heels, Harry leapt forward, twisting in mid-air as hIs gaze remained fixed on Ginny. He reappeared in the air behind her, his momentum intact, and tackled her to the ground before she had any chance to react. He brought his knee up to press on her back and caught her wand hand to hold it against the ground as he braced himself for the incoming wave...</p><p align="justify">“And we’re done. Good job you two. Alicia, Seamus, you’re up.”</p><p align="justify">The wave never managed to reach them. A flash of light engulfed it along with the entire replicated village, breaking them down into their base elements and leaving them on the bare floor of the enormous training room.</p><p align="justify">Breaking his hold on Ginny, Harry let himself fall to the side where he took the time to catch his breath before standing back up. Next to him, Ginny rolled onto her back and propped herself up on her elbows, wincing as she pulled on her bruised limbs.</p><p align="justify">“You got lucky.”</p><p align="justify">“Sure I did. Like every time we fight, right?”</p><p align="justify">She huffed, but her brilliant smile as he helped her up betrayed her lack of resentment and sent butterflies to dance in his stomach. Shaking his head to clear his thoughts, Harry brought one of Ginny’s arms around his shoulder to support her as they made their way out of the room and into the observation deck above it. There, he helped her sit on one of the last available couches while Ron and the others welcomed them. </p><p align="justify">The observation room stretched through a good half of the training room, with all but the floor and back wall being one of the alien force fields to allow them a great view of the battles below. When it was first built, Harry didn’t think they would need so much space for spectators, especially since there was only a half-dozen of them in the combat team, including him. What he hadn’t expected was the fact that many of the crew still came to take part in the training from time to time, although they tended to limit themselves to less brutal exercises.</p><p align="justify">Among them today were most of Angelina’s research team and part of the bridge crew, who began to cheer as Alicia and Seamus shot their first spells in the middle of a wide Londonian roundabout. Not all of their unofficial trainees were as excited as they were, however. In the far side of the room, Neville and Susan sat in silence, their eyes focusing on the duel in an effort to glean something, anything they could use to better their own fighting styles.</p><p align="justify">Ginny must have noticed him staring at them as she lightly pulled on his arm, prompting him to sit beside her.</p><p align="justify">“I know it’s hard to see them like that, but staring will only make it worse.”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, sorry. It’s just... I haven’t really talked much to them since... since it happened.”</p><p align="justify">“You’ve been busy. And so have them. They’ve been here almost every time we trained since Halloween. And from what I’ve heard, they haven’t sat idle during the holidays either.”</p><p align="justify">Risking another glance to the corner of the room, Harry would see the dark shadows under Neville’s eyes and the way his body seemed far too thin in his usual robes. Since the death of his grandmother, he had grown quiet and withdrawn, only opening up to Susan, despite the efforts of many amongst the crew.</p><p align="justify">Unlike Neville, Susan did not look like death warmed over, and seemed to be dealing with her grief better. From what he’d heard, she had received a lot of support from the crew. Her position as healer kept her well surrounded every day, unlike Neville who lost himself with only Goldstein and his plants for company. Yet, doubt remained in his mind, as he sometimes caught an all too familiar dullness in her eyes when she thought no one was watching.</p><p align="justify">One he had seen far too many times in the mirror after Cedric’s death.</p><p align="justify">“Is he eating properly?”</p><p align="justify">“Not until recently. It may not look like it, but he’s come a long way. It took some time to convince him, but he’s been coming back to eat with everyone more often now.” A small, hopeful smile lifted the corners of Ginny’s mouth before her eyes darted back to Harry’s. “Unlike a certain someone.”</p><p align="justify">Suddenly very interested in the content of his pouch, Harry pulled out two vials of Wiggenweld potion. The doses were small, but they would be enough to soothe their cuts and bruises. He uncorked one of them and offered it to Ginny, his eyes refusing to meet hers.</p><p align="justify">“As you said, I’ve been busy. And I could say the same to you, with how often you and Dean seem to be missing at dinner time.”</p><p align="justify">Damn it Potter. Expertly done, you just change the subject to one you dislike even more.</p><p align="justify">To make matters worse, the feeling seemed mutual. The laughter and mischief in Ginny’s eyes died as quickly as it had come. She turned away as she brought up her knees on the couch to bury her head in them.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah... That's not going to be a problem anymore. We... we broke up.”</p><p align="justify">Her voice was barely a whisper, carrying notes of sadness and regret that seemed to echo the ones that had filled Harry’s heart. In his mind, all sorts of alarms were blaring. Dread and self-loathing filled him as he realised what he had done. Panic and discomfort arose at the unexpected turn of the conversation, exacerbated by his lack of romantic experience.</p><p align="justify">And somewhere, buried under all that chaos, the embers of hope flickered.</p><p align="justify">“That’s... I’m sorry, I didn’t know.”</p><p align="justify">“It’s alright. I haven’t exactly been going around telling everyone.”</p><p align="justify">“Still, I-”</p><p align="justify">“It’s done. Neither of us can do anything about it.” She raised her head to rest her chin on her knees, her gaze losing itself in the battle below. “The last few weeks, we always ended up arguing when we were alone, so I can’t say I’m not glad it’s over but...”</p><p align="justify">Harry didn’t know what to say. He never had to comfort someone after a break-up before, let alone his own crush. So he did the only thing he could think of and brought his hand to her back, rubbing it gently. Ginny leaned toward him ever so slightly, huddling closer as they silently watched Angelina rain down birds of fire upon Seamus.</p><p align="justify">“You know...” Harry said after a few minutes. ”Slughorn invited me to this party Saturday night. It’s probably gonna be stuffy and boring, but at least there’ll be food? And maybe some quidditch pros?”</p><p align="justify">Ginny turned to look at him, eyes widening slightly and a teasing smile came to her lips.</p><p align="justify">“Why, Harry, are you asking me out on a date? Right after I tell you I’m single? Quite bold of you I must say.”</p><p align="justify">“As-As friends of course! Just... Just friends. But if you don’t want to...”</p><p align="justify">Great job Harry. Very smooth.</p><p align="justify">“No... No, I'd love to.” A smile crept on her face, almost shyly. “But you really know how to sell a night out, hum?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s just... I really didn’t want to go.” Harry sighed as he brought his free hand through his hair. “But going in good company might make the evening bearable, and you look like you need to get your mind off things, so...”</p><p align="justify">“So we’ll go together,” Ginny said, smiling in earnest once more. ”I’m sure it won’t be that bad. And it could be good for you too, you know. You've been far too broody lately, so a night out as <em> friends </em> might be just what you need.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">The whole affair ended up being, just like he feared, overly stuffy and full of pompous gits. The unwelcome surprise of entering the dining room to find himself face to face with Malfoy, whose father’s “promotion” had earned him an invitation, had cemented his bad impression.</p><p align="justify">Though, in retrospect, the party hadn’t been <em>that </em>bad. The room had been decorated like a Victorian palace, the fancy food had been delicious, even served in small portions. After a seemingly never-ending series of introductions by Slughorn, they had snatched a large plate and a bottle from the buffet before appropriating a couch in a corner of the room.</p><p align="justify">They spent most of the night making fun of the pricks in hushed whispers, trying and failing to be as discreet as they could while getting increasingly tipsy. They had a great time laughing at everyone’s overly serious expressions, inventing increasingly ridiculous reasons for their presence in Slughorn’s collection.</p><p align="justify">The dirty looks the other guests sent them didn’t deter them in any way, and even Slughorn gave up on trying to get the pair to join them after a while. There had also been that Mallow girl... Brigitte? Bridgett? Not that her name had mattered, anyway, since she didn’t stay very long. She had come to him when Ginny left his side to get another plate and had seemed a bit too interested in Harry’s opinions for Slytherin company, asking far too many questions and getting a bit too close for comfort.</p><p align="justify">Not that he would complain about it now, mind you since he would have missed the sight of Ginny chasing her from their couch otherwise. There was something to be said about cute redheads acting all jealous over you and sticking close to deter the competition.</p><p align="justify">The night had been far more enjoyable after that last little snag. Their hilarity and what his alcohol-addled brain suspected to be a bottomless bottle did wonders to distract Harry from his daily worries and turn his mind to much more interesting matters.</p><p align="justify">Like how well Ginny had dressed up, for example.</p><p align="justify">When she came down to the entrance hall, she had looked even better than she had during the Yule ball a couple of years ago. And his traitorous wandering eyes couldn’t help but notice that she had grown quite a bit since then, in a way that the bulky armoured suit she usually wore really didn’t do justice...</p><p align="justify">They had ended the night after far too many drinks when they lit up the two Filibuster’s Fireworks Ginny had pulled two from somewhere and thrown the stifling reception into chaos. They ran away from Slughorn’s dining room roaring in laughter until they lost themselves, breathless, in the corridor.</p><p align="justify">And if they had held each other a bit too close when they unsteadily made their way back to the seventh floor... Well, it was no one’s business but theirs, really.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="justify">The sound of heavy, mechanical breathing filled the hallway as a tall figure advanced toward his target, an old man in tattered hooded robes. Both figures ignited and raised their colourful blades in anticipation of a climactic clash of destinies which would decide the fate of the galaxy. Haughty threats and quips were exchanged, as the blades of a master and his fallen apprentice met in a battle of strength and will.</p><p align="justify">“This is <em> awesome</em>.”</p><p align="justify">Katie’s remark was quickly shushed by the rest of the audience, but with her undivided attention focused on the great screen on the wall of the lounge, she did not even notice it. This movie night was a special one, as an overly enthusiastic Lee had brought back the new re-release of the first Star Wars movie he’d been talking about for months now. And as the last jedi and the lord of darkness fought one another in a duel on which hung the destiny of all things, the room was filled with an almost palpable tension and awe.</p><p align="justify">"Could we make some of those laser swords? It’d be dead useful stuff to have."</p><p align="justify">“Not to mention awesome.”</p><p align="justify">"I don't know... Maybe? I’m not sure if maintaining a laser, or whatever the blade is, in that shape is even possible."</p><p align="justify">“Don’t bother. It’s not like he would be able to swing one without cutting his own leg or something.”</p><p align="justify">“Hey! I’d be great with a sword! Better than you, at least.”</p><p align="justify">The argument was shushed down again as the dramatic fight concluded with the death of the old Jedi and the film carried on. As the climactic end neared, the space battle on the screen had them at the edge of their seats. The small Rebel forces were slowly being picked off by the merciless troops of the Empire as they made their desperate dive through the Death Star’s trench.</p><p align="justify">“Forget the swords, I want one of these x-ships.”</p><p align="justify">“Why bother with the small fighters when you can have one of those dreadnoughts we saw earlier? It’d be like the entire station could move around and shoot things down.“</p><p align="justify">“And you’d just be a big target standing there, impossible to miss and too slow to avoid anything. Think of what we could do with real fighters instead of just hoverboards.”</p><p align="justify">“Well, the Death Eaters aren’t exactly flying around in spaceships, thankfully. So it’s not like we would have any use for either of those anyway.”</p><p align="justify">“Speak for yourself. I’m sure the big brains of engineering are already working on it.”</p><p align="justify">“Oi! Stop calling us-”</p><p align="justify">“We looked a bit into it, but there are just so many problems and things to consider that the project was shelved for now. We’ll definitely get back to it when we’ll have a better grasp of how <em> Requirement </em> works, and have access to more efficient generators to allow-”</p><p align="justify">“Will you all shut up? We’re trying to watch a movie here!“</p><hr /><p align="justify">“At first, we thought she’d finally been caught sneaking into the library at night one too many times and they wanted to punish her. It wouldn’t have been the first time, you know? So when the Professors took Amanda aside, we weren’t really worried. B-But when she missed lunch <em> and </em>dinner, we knew something had happened. Sure, we sometimes had to d-drag her out of her books to come down to eat, but-”</p><p align="justify">Padma’s rambling became unintelligible as her words devolved into messy sobs, and Ginny’s comforting hand began to gently rub her back to sooth her.</p><p align="justify">“It’s ok. Take your time.”</p><p align="justify">Ron, who stood awkwardly in front of them, pulled out a tissue from one of the many pouches he had added to his suit and offered it to Padma without a word. Despite all he had been through the last few years, consoling crying girls was definitely not something he was comfortable with. After several deep breaths and nose blowing, she managed to steady her voice enough to resume her tale.</p><p align="justify">“When she came back to the dorms, she told us... She told us that her entire family was dead. Her house had been burned to the ground and a dark mark was floating above it. She looked so... broken. We tried to console her, but what can you even tell someone when they lost-Merlin, her brother was <em> five </em>. How could someone even do this?”</p><p align="justify">“Do you have any idea why they were targeted? I mean, they haven’t exactly been going after specific people out in the muggle world before. Not since the last war at least.”</p><p align="justify">“I... No, I don’t. They are-<em> were </em> gardeners. Amanda didn’t even want to tell them about all the bad things happening in the magical world... They were so happy when her brother had his first bout of accidental magic. They didn’t even know <em> why </em> they were-”</p><p align="justify">Her voice broke once more as new tears filled her eyes.</p><p align="justify">Ron’s brow furrowed as his mind began to race. This could be bad. Very bad.</p><p align="justify">“Wait, her brother had magic too?”</p><p align="justify">“Not the time, Ron.”</p><p align="justify">“No, hear me out here. This might be the reason they were attacked. The ministry can’t go after the students in Hogwarts while Dumbledore is there, right? And the Trace can detect us if we use magic outside school. What if they decided to prevent the next generation of muggle-borns from ever reaching Hogwarts?”</p><p align="justify">The girls’ eyes widened in fear and shock at the implications. Padma’s mouth opened soundlessly a few times before she managed to find her voice again.</p><p align="justify">“You mean... They’re after the <em> kids </em>?”</p><p align="justify">“It never stopped them before. And even if that’s not how or why they did it, I doubt it will be long before they start using the Trace like that.”</p><p align="justify">“Can we even do anything about that? I’ve never heard about anyone fooling the Trace.”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t know... The magic’s pretty much unavoidable.” Ron crossed his arms as he dug deep into his memory, bringing out faded remembrances of a long past talk. “I think they use an artefact to interpret it though. Dad told me it's like a big map that lights up every time someone who’s not supposed to use magic, but he never went into the details. He was mostly warning me <em> not </em> to use my wand.”</p><p align="justify">Ginny was not exactly in a pleasant enough mood to discuss magical theories, however, and stood up abruptly, her entire being burning in righteous fury.</p><p align="justify">“Who cares how it works? If it’s just a piece of parchment then, we just have to burn it down and they won’t be able to find those kids anymore.”</p><p align="justify">Her outburst made Padma flinch, but she soon nodded at her words, her tears flowing freely from her eyes where sadness turned into determination.</p><p align="justify">“Hey, I’m not saying we let them do it. But we can’t exactly walk in and destroy it. We’re talking about one of the most secure parts of the Ministry here. <em> And </em> they’ve increased security since Malfoy’s dad took over.”</p><p align="justify">“We can’t just sit here forever! We have to do <em> something </em>!”</p><p align="justify">“I know Gin. I’ll...” Ron fought back a sigh that was becoming far too familiar lately. “I’ll bring it up to Harry and we’ll see what we can do.”</p><p align="justify">If he even let them do <em>anything</em>.</p><hr /><p align="justify">Neptune shone brightly through the large windows of the station’s corridor, its light a pleasant companion to Harry in the early hours of the evening. The recent incidents had been an unwelcome highlight of their need for greater medical expertise and resources, and the daily reports he was now receiving made sure the issue remained on his mind. While he could understand their impatience, their insistence was now dangerously bordering harassment and did nothing to warm Harry to their demands.</p><p align="justify">After a heated talk with Ernie, Harry was now making his way toward the infirmary, intent on keeping his frayed nerves in check when he would reassure Susan and Dean that he was, in fact, trying to solve their problems. Taking one last calming breath, he made the final turn that brought him to the door he sought and stopped in his tracks.</p><p align="justify">“-shouldn’t have to tell you that the suit can only take so much. Especially since you guys don’t bother wearing the armoured parts down there. It’s a wonder why you even made them in the first place.”</p><p align="justify">“It’s not exactly safety equipment. They were supposed to be for—Outch!—for battle so they’re far too heavy to lug around all day. I don’t know how Potter does it.”</p><p align="justify">“Habit I’ll say. I think he even <em> sleeps </em> in his armour these days.”</p><p align="justify">Amidst the soft beeping of the consoles and the sound of simmering potions, Dean and Terry’s voices were carried out of the infirmary with such clarity that they could have been right next to Harry. Awkward as silently standing out of sight of the open door was, it was a far better prospect than interrupting the conversation at this point. Trying to distract himself, Harry brought up his slate and did his best to focus on the logs of the last flight of <em> Requirement</em>.</p><p align="justify">“Jokes aside, you’ll need to be more careful down there. It’s like I can’t go a day without someone from your team coming in for a burn or a broken nose. No one has ended up as bad as Fred did yet, but it’s just a matter of time at this rate.”</p><p align="justify">“We don’t exactly have the time to be careful. You heard about Brimingham?”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah... Can’t say I’m fond of how things are turning out down there.”</p><p align="justify">Despite his efforts, the runes displayed on Harry’s slate could have been dancing around while balancing trolls on their branches and he wouldn’t have noticed.</p><p align="justify">Brimingham...</p><p align="justify">Whispers of the events had come to the crew through the families of their muggle-born members. Hundreds of people suddenly fell into vegetative states when an unpredicted cold front descended upon the city. Now, two days after the first reports, the streets remained in chaos as people fled the city while more and more victims continued to be found.</p><p align="justify">The true nature of the wave of dread that befell upon the unsuspecting muggles was the largest pack of dementors in living memory. While the motivation behind this atrocity remained unknown, rumours were spreading like wildfire through the station. Some thought the Ministry had decided on new feeding policies for their jailers, while others grimly suggested some Death Eaters simply wanted to have a good laugh that day.</p><p align="justify">During that time, the Daily Prophet had preferred to report on other, more pressing subjects. No doubt they had judged that these events were unworthy of the ink they would need to spend on them. They instead elected to publish an edifying multiple-page piece on the oh-so-important need to lift the restrictions on freshwater creatures' breeding in order to compete with the mainland by repelling century-old laws.</p><p align="justify">The fact that these laws had been established to protect the few merpeople communities remaining in Britain was of course conveniently left out of the passionate plea in favour of the Minister’s agenda.</p><p align="justify">In stark contrast to the Prophet’s enthusiasm to lick Lucius Malfoy’s boots, the Quibbler had become a surprising, and sometimes worrying, herald of the truth. The tabloid was now publishing reports on the atrocities condoned by the new administration in between its usual crackpot articles and was gaining in popularity among the British muggle-borns.</p><p align="justify">Having the conspiracy theories on their side wasn’t quite the win Harry would have hoped for, but it was still far better than not being able to get news and warnings out to those who still hoped to get through those troubled times.</p><p align="justify">“If we can’t go out and fight directly, this is the only way we have of helping those who do. The more he works, the more chances there are that we’ll invent something that’ll actually save lives or help to end the war.”</p><p align="justify">“Can’t say I’d like seeing you all throw yourselves against Death Eaters, but... You’re right. We can’t just sit here and do nothing forever. Just... be careful, alright? You won’t save anyone if you-”</p><p align="justify">Despite the soft tone of Dean’s voice, Terry and him never heard Harry’s footsteps as he went back the way he came without a word.</p><hr /><p align="justify">Like every other day of the week, Toke Trail, a sprawling hub of all things magical niched in Bristol’s old city, was teeming with activity. The hundreds of people marching in the alleys were not the usual candid shoppers or sauntering passersby, however. The upsets and desperate, marginalised by the recent reforms, had taken to the streets to proclaim their discontent with anger-fueled chants and colourful signs floating in the air. United in outrage, confidence filled their steps and voices, for they knew that the rest of Magical Britain’s downtrodden walked with them in London, Durham and Canterbury.</p><p align="justify">Brayden Selwyn, one of the many new recruits of the Auror Office, hid in the shadows of a side alley with the half-dozen hit wizards under his command. The low-ranking enforcers were far from pleasant company and made the wait for his colleague’s signal all the more unpleasant. Even now, they were yet again exchanging vulgar jokes about the protesting mudbloods, despite his many injunctions to keep silent.</p><p align="justify">Not that the idea of ridiculing those animals was unpalatable, but one had to consider the time and place for such things. A dirty alley with overflowing garbage bins that smelled like a Troll’s undergarment during his first official assignment certainly did not fit the bill on either point.</p><p align="justify">Bringing back down the too-short sleeve of his uniform to cover the barely visible ink on his left forearm, Brayden sent an impatient look across the crowded street. Behind the boarded-up windows of a condemned shop, he knew that another group was preparing one of the dozen anchors for the anti-apparition wards being erected around the district.</p><p align="justify">Unlike the last hundred times he had surveilled the building, however, the smoke lazily coming out of the shop’s chimney darkened to a charcoal black and Brayden’s every muscle tensed in anticipation. His grasp on his wand tightened and, with a quick reprimand to his men, brought them to order as he stepped into the street.</p><p align="justify">The protesters had finally passed by his hiding place, and he could see the back of the procession continuing their march a few shops down the street. Quickly, the hit wizards formed up around him as the second group came out of the shop to join them as the mudbloods began to slow down. The other groups, dispatched around the district, had begun to block the path of the protest as it passed through a square, essentially trapping them as the lines of Aurors and hit wizards surrounded them. It did not take long for the protesters to grow restless and begin to throw insults and threats at them, but it was the few who brought out their wands that caught their attention.</p><p align="justify">These were the ones that would need to be neutralised first.</p><p align="justify">Unfortunately, and to Brayden’s great disappointment, their orders were not to clean the streets of the filth that dirtied them, only to keep them contained. It did not stop a satisfied smirk from spreading on his lips distant shouts of fear began to fill the air, however. The weak wind that had blown all morning grew cold as panic swept through the crowd when they finally understood that dementors were feasting on the other side of the procession.</p><p align="justify">The street was plunged into chaos as hundreds of people tried to flee in every direction, all attempts at restraint and civility forgotten, only to be stopped by the cordon of Aurors and hit wizards. Try as they might to open a path by hexes and fists, the protesters were stopped by conjured obstacles and dark curses that left them incapacitated.</p><p align="justify">Of those who managed to keep a cooler head, a few tried to apparate away only to be violently thrown to the ground when they hit the wards. Others attempted to make their own way out by going through the buildings and a thin silver mist began to spread as a handful of wizards tried and failed to conjure Patronuses. Despite their best efforts, however, very few managed to break free.</p><p align="justify">When the dust and frost settled on the square, dozens of unresponsive bodies littered the pavement, bringing an end to what the Daily Prophet would call “a sedition act years in the making” the next morning. And for the first time in thirty years, the Quibbler’s printing press remained silent when the time for a new edition came.</p><hr /><p align="justify">“I said no.”</p><p align="justify">Harry didn’t want to have this discussion. Not again. He had thought that today’s training session would allow him to decompress a bit from all the bad news they had received lately, but his hopes were quickly dashed when he ran into Ginny on his way there.</p><p align="justify">Under any other circumstances, the coincidence would have been a godsend and they would have shared a few playful moments before joining the others. Any chance of that happening died with what remained of his good mood when he saw her expression and the anger in her every movement as she stomped toward him.</p><p align="justify">“That’s why I’m not asking anymore.” Her hand closed around Harry’s arm as it would a quaffle, forcing him to a stop. “We’ve been patient, but since you decided that you’d rather keep your head buried up your arse than be helpful, someone has to get it out for you.”</p><p align="justify">“We’re not discussing this. I told you already, we can’t take that risk! Not yet anyway.”</p><p align="justify">The finality in Harry’s tone was sharpened by annoyance, as he shook his arm free of Ginny’s grasp and resumed his walk. He already had this conversation several days ago with Ron, and so many more with others these last few months. Unfortunately for him, none of them seemed to understand that they were simply not ready. Then again, how could they? Few of them had to fight for their lives before, and none had had to face Voldemort himself in a duel. They simply didn’t know just how outmatched they were.</p><p align="justify">And they also didn’t know when to quit it seems. Ginny picked up her pace, passing him and blocking the way to the door.</p><p align="justify">“They took Luna's dad, for Merlin’s sake!”</p><p align="justify">Harry stopped in his tracks.</p><p align="justify">That... That he did not know. Sure, he had a passing thought or two about how unusually late this week’s Quibbler had been, but this is the first time he had heard of Mr. Lovegood’s disappearance.</p><p align="justify">He did not have long to ponder this revelation, however, as Ginny was not one to let the opportunity of his surprised silence slip away.</p><p align="justify">“The more we wait, the more we lose. We can’t keep doing nothing while you do whatever it is you do with Dumbledore every other month.“</p><p align="justify">“We-”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t. I’ve had enough of your excuses. So here’s what we’re gonna do.” Without turning away or breaking eye contact, Ginny pressed the door panel behind her, revealing the training room. “We’re going to duel. Right now. Using everything we have and without holding back. If I win, you’ll stop with this overly cautious crap and you’re finally going to start acting like a proper captain.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m not going to fight with you over this.”</p><p align="justify">“Well, that’s too bad.” She took a step back as she grabbed Harry by his collar, pulling him with her into the room. ”Because I will.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">When he noticed the slight tremor in the air in the corner of his eye, it was far too late.</p><p align="justify">The invisible punch hit him square in the side of the head, breaking his concentration on the shield he was painfully holding up. The semi-transparent shimmer in the air shattered as the blow made him lose his footing. He fell on his sides and quickly rolled away before a flash of red hit the floor where he had been a second ago.</p><p align="justify">“We found this ship. We’re the ones training every day to fight. We’re the ones who got rid of Umbridge.”</p><p align="justify">Gritting his teeth, Harry pushed himself up as fast as his painfully throbbing head and leg allowed him, Squinting as he looked around for the tiniest distortion in the seemingly empty space around him. Without his helmet, he had no way of knowing where Ginny was and his spells missed more often than not. His only option was to stay on the move, keep his guard up and use spells with a wide area of effect. </p><p align="justify">“And <em> we </em>are the ones losing our family while you keep us leached here!”</p><p align="justify">Her shout gave Harry enough warning that he could raise another shield behind him in time for a nasty yellow hex to splash harmlessly against it. Breaking into a run on the left, Harry sent a large wave of flames in the direction the spell had come from, knowing full well that Ginny wasn’t there anymore.</p><p align="justify">The most annoying thing about fighting against an invisible opponent using one of their hoverboards was that they could adjust the size of its electromagnetic cushion. By making it as thin as possible, the board would almost be touching the ground, but it would also reduce the sound made by its generator to almost nothing.</p><p align="justify">“You’re not some sort of martyr. Stop trying to protect us by shouldering everything yourself. We’re all in this hell together for Merlin’s sake!”</p><p align="justify">Harry ducked, avoiding a series of spells by a hair’s breadth, and decided that enough was enough. Whipping his wand downward, he brought it back up in circles, turning the pavement under his feet to the sand. Harry closed his eyes, holding his breath as he brought his wand back down.</p><p align="justify">“Depulso! Protego!”</p><p align="justify">He felt the sand being blasted upward and fall back down on his shield before he dared to open his eyes again. When he did, he saw that a sizable portion of the room had been covered in it, and the floating silhouette that stood out against it had not escaped the dry rain.</p><p align="justify">Not wasting any time, especially since he could already see her move, Harry raised his wand high in sharp motions.</p><p align="justify">“Magnus Fulgur!”</p><p align="justify">A blinding flash of lightning burst from his wand, hitting Ginny right as she tried to flee. Her cry of pain made Harry wince but did not dampen his satisfaction as he saw her. Small arcs of electricity ran across her armour and the board before dissipating, leaving her visible as her hoverboard fell to the ground with a loud clanking sound.</p><p align="justify">“It’s ove-”</p><p align="justify">Fighting through the pain, Ginny leapt from the ground and started running toward him, her wand whipping the air as she sent one spell after the other in his direction. Taking a step back, Harry brought his shield back up and hastily deflected a spike of stone before it could pierce his side.</p><p align="justify">"You keep saying that we need to fight this war, that we can't leave it to the adults. But you’re the one stopping us from actually doing something!"</p><p align="justify">"That's not fair! We need to prepare-"</p><p align="justify">"Prepare? That's all we've been doing for a year!"</p><p align="justify">"We're not ready!"</p><p align="justify">"We have the training!"</p><p align="justify">As he deflected another hex, Harry lost his footing, slipping on the oil that Ginny had turned underneath him the sand into.</p><p align="justify">"We have the tech!"</p><p align="justify">As he readied a blasting curse that would have brought him time to get up, Harry was suddenly blinded when Ginny brought up her other hand, a small stone shining on her suit-covered wrist.</p><p align="justify">"We have the numbers!"</p><p align="justify">His sight quickly recovering, Harry leapt to the side and stood back up in the same movement, avoiding another spell as he sent one of his own. Ginny easily deflected his haphazardly thrown stunner and finally closed the distance between them.</p><p align="justify">She dropped on one knee and swept his legs with her own, making him fall once more. Harry’s armour took the brunt of the fall but the show made him drop his wand. Ginny straddled him, pinning his wand hand to the ground as she brought back her own, fist closed.</p><p align="justify">“We. Are. Ready."</p><p align="justify">“Stop!”</p><p align="justify">Ginny’s fist stopped inches before his nose. One of her eyebrows was raised in a silent interrogation.</p><p align="justify">”I give up. We’ll do it. Happy now?”</p><p align="justify">“Very.”</p><p align="justify">Grinning, she brought back her fist and stood back up before holding out her hand to him. With a defeated sight, Harry took it and pushed himself off the oily ground.</p><p align="justify">He was so going to regret this.</p><p align="justify">And yet, deep down, he felt a knot of anxiety and fears begin to loosen up as he looked at Ginny in all her dishevelled, singed and smiling glory.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="justify">“If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it right.”</p><p align="justify">The light of Neptune cast wide shadows against the carmine panels covering the walls of Harry’s office. At his desk, Harry and Ron were trying to bring some sense of order to the piles of books and parchments, in search of any relevant one that had been cast aside. Nearby, going through his own notes on a data slate, Ernie wrote down a list of preparations they had been working on for the last hour.</p><p align="justify">“I want a full report on the Ministry’s new security measures and suggestions on how to bypass them by the end of the week.”</p><p align="justify">“I’ll get Angelina on it.”</p><p align="justify">Since Ginny successfully “convinced” Harry, it seemed like the entire crew had been shaken out of its resigned lethargy and the station bustled with activity. While a few remained uncertain, the corridors were once more filled with the sounds of excitement and hope, the eagerness to fight spreading like wildfire through the crew.</p><p align="justify">They had been chomping at the bit for months now. Training, studying the ship, securing safe houses and moving around supplies for the people they had relocated... It was time for something real. Something that mattered. </p><p align="justify">Something that proved that they mattered.</p><p align="justify">“We’ll also need an inventory of everything the engineers have found or made that we could use.”</p><p align="justify">“You’ll have it tomorrow. I think the twins finally managed to fix that damned egg grenade of theirs.”</p><p align="justify">“That’d be useful. But make sure they’re properly tested first. I don’t want anyone getting injured because their tech exploded when they tried to use it.”</p><p align="justify">“Send me the list once you’re done.” Ron piped up. “I’ll get a few of each and have the team play with them for a bit.”</p><p align="justify">Harry hummed in agreement.</p><p align="justify">“Better they learn how to use them now rather than when we’re inside. Speaking of which... I want you to take the lead once we’re in.”</p><p align="justify">The look Ron gave him in return would not have been out of place if Harry had just professed his undying love for Snape.</p><p align="justify">“Mate, I’ve spent five years in the castle and I still get lost sometimes. You do <em> not </em> want me to guide you anywhere.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, I do. You’re the only one of us who’s actually gone to the Auror office before. You also know most of the surveillance stuff they have lying around that we’ll need to avoid.”</p><p align="justify">Well, that wasn’t exactly true.</p><p align="justify">Harry had gone there once in passing the previous year, to wait for his hearing, though he would have been hard-pressed to remember the way now. Ron, for his part, had gone there multiple times over the years with his father, whose office was located beyond the Aurors’. While it could have been enough to justify the appointment, it was little more than an excuse in Harry”s eyes.</p><p align="justify">Umbridge removal may have been their first operation, but they had not been in any real danger given their tech and the fact that they were still in Hogwarts. This time, however, would be far, far different. They would need to infiltrate the heart of the hive, surrounded by all sides by death eaters and sympathisers. And while they couldn’t afford to make any mistakes, there would be no better opportunity for a trial by fire of their combat team and their commander.</p><p align="justify">“I’m...” Ron held his stare for a few moments, and Harry could almost see in his eyes the self-deprecating words of refusal that died before they could pass his lips.</p><p align="justify">They stayed like this for a few moments, saying nothing and everything at the same time. This was the boy who had not hesitated for a second before sacrificing himself for his friends on the chessboard. The boy who had jumped into the chamber of secrets with him to face a monster that could kill with nothing but a look. The boy who had stood on his broken leg to protect him from whom they thought was a murderer.</p><p align="justify">The boy who had his complete and utter trust.</p><p align="justify">Finally, Ron straightened himself, all traces of doubt and hesitation fading away from his expression, though a slight tremor in his voice remained. “Alright. Yeah, I’ll ... I’ll do it.”</p><p align="justify">Harry gave him a confident smile and a nod, certain that he had made the right choice. He may be in charge of the crew, but this was Ron’s team, and just like Ron himself, they needed to be reminded of that.</p><p align="justify">“Sorry to interrupt your little staring contest, but we still have work to do. I’ll be joining your training sessions until the day of the mission, Ron. Knowing you two, I've got a feeling that I’m going to need to get better at dodging.”</p><p align="justify">Finally breaking eye contact, Ron and Harry both turned toward Ernie with similar looks of surprise.</p><p align="justify">“What? You thought I’d let you guys go without me?”</p><p align="justify">“Well ... kinda.” Ron gave a quick glance back at Harry. “You aren’t exactly a duelling pro.”</p><p align="justify">Harry, for his part, did not look away. He narrowed his eyes, searching for any trace of doubt in Ernie’s expression, only to be met with a self-assured, almost amused grin.</p><p align="justify">"You sure about this? This isn't going to be a walk in the park. You might be better off staying here."</p><p align="justify">"And let you get yourself killed after all the work I had to put in to train you just right? I'm not starting over with a new captain, thank you very much."</p><hr /><p align="justify">This was it.</p><p align="justify">A year of training, research and preparations and the concerted efforts of the entire D.S.F had made this moment possible. There would be no more holding back. No more watching from orbit as the country went to hell.<br />
<br />
It all started now ... By flushing far too many toilets.</p><p align="justify">Angelina’s team had made good on their reconnaissance of the Ministry. An invisible Zacharias Smith had followed Ensign Pryden while he visited under the pretence of negotiating the exorbitant taxes they paid each month to keep the shop running. His observations had been completed by Angelina’s own after she attempted to break into the Ministry at night, only to be stopped each time by Dementors and seemingly unbreakable locks.</p><p align="justify">Even if they managed to repel the dark creatures and make their way in, some rudimentary detection charms favoured by curse-breakers had revealed an impressive set of wards protecting the building. If they tried to force their way in, one way or the other, the entire Department of Magical Law Enforcement would come crashing down on them before they had the time to cross the atrium.</p><p align="justify">Not even the more hot-headed of them were foolish enough to think that a full-blown assault would result in anything less than a massacre. Which meant they only had one solution that didn’t include using the ship to blow up the entire Greater London area.</p><p align="justify">They would simply go in through the front door.</p><p align="justify">Or more precisely, the newly installed toilet stalls of the Whitehall underground station reserved for the Ministry’s low-ranking employees. Each member of the infiltration team had invisibly followed an employee in the toilet cubicles and quickly flushed themselves down after them before the next one stepped in.</p><p align="justify">Side-stepping the security checkpoints that awaited every freshly flushed arrival, they had regrouped in the atrium proper, where the higher-ranking officials casually stepped out of the Floo and went on to their business, unhampered by any security measure.</p><p align="justify">Their intrusion had almost ended abruptly when Alicia had crossed one of the checkpoints, and a sneakoscope a bit too sensitive for their well-being came to life. As the device spun and whistled sharply, the crowd around the checkpoint hurriedly distanced themselves from the poor sod that was being checked at the time. Each one of them tried their best to appear as innocent as possible as Hit Wizards made their way toward the commotion. Thankfully, in their hurry to dissociate themselves from the potential criminal, no one seemed to notice the invisible girl who had to push her way out of the crowd.</p><p align="justify">This little incident only served to reassure Ernie that Ron had been right to keep their group small, despite the many others who had wanted to join in. Neville and Susan in particular had been the most vocal about it, and their insistence had almost made him feel guilty that he had used his closeness to the Captain to impose himself on their first real mission. Almost.</p><p align="justify">“While we’re here, we should go to the Department of Mysteries and release Fudge’s Heliopaths army. That way the Death Eaters won’t be able to use them against us later.”</p><p align="justify">"For the last time, Heliopaths don’t exist, Luna.”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, and there’s plenty of strange things in the Ministry already, so you don’t need to invent some.” Seamus piped up. “Did you know the building isn’t hooked up to London's power grid? The whole complex is powered by literal bottled lightning, collected in high sea by a fleet of storm-chasing sailboats that-"</p><p align="justify">"Guys, this isn't a tour. Keep radio silence unless strictly necessary."</p><p align="justify">Cautious not to bump into the many employees going about their business, the group made their way to the elevators. They passed next to the disgusting monument that had replaced the golden fountain at the centre of the atrium and saw far too many banners and posters that promoted something called the Department of Merit.</p><p align="justify">The snippets of conversation and the slogans as subtle as a Troll in an apothecary shop on the posters quickly painted a grim picture of the goal of this new branch of law enforcement. They were Aurors and Hit Hizards who had been assigned to investigate and root out the “corrupt and lazy holdouts of the previous administration”, or anyone that would go against the new order both inside and outside the Ministry.</p><p align="justify">As if getting rid of the muggle-borns had not been enough for them. How far would they push their witch hunt, and how few would be left after they’re done? They had enough trouble recruiting as it is without the Ministry going after every-</p><p align="justify">Hold on.</p><p align="justify">“Guys...”</p><p align="justify">“Just keep going, we’re almost there.”</p><p align="justify">“No-I mean, we are, but I think we should make a detour.”</p><p align="justify">“Ernie, we’re on a mission. We don’t-”</p><p align="justify">“No, listen. This Department of Merit thing? It’s investigating everyone who doesn’t agree with them, right?” With the silence that was his answer, it wasn’t hard for Ernie to imagine them looking at each other in confusion behind the blank metal of their helmets. “They’re looking into the people who would oppose the ministry and making <em> files </em> on them.“</p><p align="justify">Perhaps unsurprisingly after the last few months, the mention of paperwork seemed to have sparked understanding in the Captain’s mind.</p><p align="justify">“You mean ... They’ve already compiled a list of people we could trust?”</p><p align="justify">“Exactly! We don’t have to waste time doing background checks on everyone if we know the Death Eaters don’t want them. If we find those files, we could have a thousand people on Requirement by next week!”</p><p align="justify">That seemed to finally get their interest, as excited chatter filled their communication channel, only to die out as quickly as it came when Harry spoke again.</p><p align="justify">“Alright, but we need to think this through. Chances are they’ll raise the alarm as soon as we destroy the map so we’ll need to go find those files before that. Ron-”</p><p align="justify">“Look. I’d love nothing more than to go around and take care of everything wrong in the ministry, starting with Malfoy’s dad, but we have a mission to complete. There are hundreds of families out there who have no idea of the danger they’re in. We can’t take any unnecessary risks.”</p><p align="justify">“And we can’t pass this up!” Ernie interjected. “We’ll never get an opportunity like that again. Once they notice we’ve managed to get in, they’ll tighten up security even more.”</p><p align="justify">“You’re both right.” Harry said as he stepped in between them. “We have to take the risk, but not at the cost of the mission. That’s why we’ll split up. I’ll go with Ernie and we’ll go search the new department while you complete the mission. Chances are we’ll need time to go through the files anyway, so you should have enough time to destroy the map.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m going too.” Ginny stepped forward, placing herself beside Harry and Ernie. “I’m not letting you get yourselves killed by going down there alone.”</p><p align="justify">“... Fine.” Ron relented in a tone that left no doubt on his opinion. “But you don’t need to go there.”</p><p align="justify">“Ron-”</p><p align="justify">“Not like that. What I mean is you need to go to the central archives. Every piece of paper in the building will end up there eventually. And I doubt it’s as well guarded as the other department if they have Aurors leading it.”</p><p align="justify">“Noted. That should make things easier.” The comm channel fell silent, and Harry’s silhouette on their helmet’s display seemed to look at them all in turn, hesitating for a brief moment before speaking again. “We’ll see you when it’s done. Good luck.”</p><p align="justify">And just like that, Harry was off. Ginny and Ernie followed him a moment later, leaving behind the rest of the group while Ernie added motivational speeches to his mental list of the things he would need to have Harry work on.</p><hr /><p align="justify">"You know, you never told us it would be this big.”</p><p align="justify">After arriving on the second floor, Ron had led his team through the law enforcement offices until they’d reached a door guarded by a Hit Wizard. Above it, next to an opening through which paper planes came and went, an engraved silver plate announced it to be the Improper use of Magic office, the most likely location for their target.</p><p align="justify">Shortly after their arrival, an older woman with a strict look passed by them and went in. He’d taken the opportunity to send Luna to slip inside after her to assess the situation inside while they waited outside behind a corner of the hallway.</p><p align="justify">“I take it that means it’s in there? Do you see anything else?”</p><p align="justify">“Well, there are a lot of desks and bookcases and a huge chandelier made of floating glass balls filled with light...”</p><p align="justify">“Still not here to visit.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, and there are three Hit Wizards, a dozen clerks and a couple other doors.”</p><p align="justify">“Alright, we’re going in. Give me the name of one of the clerks.”</p><p align="justify">“Okay! Hmm ... Not that one ... This one’s nose is too big...”</p><p align="justify">“Any will do Luna.” Ron sighed.</p><p align="justify">“Fine. There’s one named Corren Davis.” Luna humphed. “You really are a lot more fun when we’re in space, you know? We need to get you back on the ship as soon as possible. Or maybe it’s because of this place? Do you think it’s something in the walls? Or maybe-”</p><p align="justify">Having already tuned out Luna’s rambling and the snickers of Katie and Seamus, Ron took out a sheet of paper he’d picked up on a desk earlier and pressed the tip of his wand to it.</p><p align="justify">“Mr. Davis, it has come to my attention that one of your recent reports regarded the child of one of our most well-regarded citizens.” As he spoke, taking great care to sound as insufferably stiff as he could, the words inscribed themselves on the paper in a neat and professional handwriting that couldn’t be further than his own scribbles. “While I’m sure this is just a dreadful misunderstanding, I need you to come to my office immediately so we can sort this out before I need to fill a report of my own about your work. Signed Pius Thicknesse.“</p><p align="justify">He tapped the sheet with his wand and released it from his hold as it folded itself in the form of a plane and took off around the corner in the direction of the door.</p><p align="justify">“When the clerk comes out, we confound the guard and we go in. Don’t hesitate. Ready?”</p><p align="justify">Sounds of agreement in the comm channel answered him and he guessed that most of them, having found their seriousness, only nodded back.</p><p align="justify">Everyone being invisible like that was weird, even with the helmet giving him a rough idea of their position. At least with Harry’s cloak, you could see the other person under it.</p><p align="justify">Hearing the door opening got Ron out of his thoughts and around the corner in a second. With magic deafening the sound of their steps, they rushed for the opened door as a heavy man came out of the room. He hurried around the man and caught the door before it closed as Alicia and Seamus whispered the incantation of the confusion charm.</p><p align="justify">Once everyone was through, he closed the door behind them and took in the sheer size of the room. It was easily as large as the great hall back in Hogwarts. Rows of mostly empty desks were lined up against the walls on bleachers like a rectangular amphitheatre overlooking the glass floor below that covered most of the room.</p><p align="justify">Underneath said floor was a giant and yellowed map of the British Isles that looked like it had been drawn when Godric Gryffindor was still crawling around on all fours. Copper rings of various sizes were moving around the map under the glass, and each time one stopped somewhere, it glowed and one of the clerks would take note.</p><p align="justify">“Luna wasn’t kidding. This thing is huge.”</p><p align="justify">“The ministry doesn’t really do things by halves when it comes to the Statute.”</p><p align="justify">“It’s almost sad that we need to destroy it. I don’t know if there’s anyone alive that could make a new one.”</p><p align="justify">“I think that’s a good thing. Wouldn’t want to have to come back if there was.”</p><p align="justify">“Let’s burn this one before we start thinking of the next. Spread out and get ready to neutralise everyone on my signal.”</p><p align="justify">Without a sound or even a shimmer in the air, the six of them scattered around the chamber, its occupants none the wiser until a bored clerk looked down to a strange metal egg that rolled under his chair.</p><p align="justify">“Hey Craig, you dropped some-”</p><p align="justify">An intense blue light and a piercing sound burst from under him echoed from five other parts of the room, and bolts of electricity arced from one clerk to the next. At the same time, the red hue of stupefying charms impacted the three Hit Wizards.</p><p align="justify">For a brief moment, the room seemed frozen in time as the unconscious bodies of the ministry workers lay motionless where they fell. Then, the empty air distorted as the teenagers became visible one after the other and gathered in the centre of the room.</p><p align="justify">“Nice work everyone. Now let’s finish this and we can go get Harry from whatever pitfall he managed to fall in. On three.” Ron raised his wand toward the floor, aiming as far away from the group as he could, the others following his lead. “One. Two. Three. Bombarda!”</p><p align="justify">Five voices joined his own and Ron hurriedly raised his other arm, activating the shield emitter embedded in his vambrace to protect himself against the glass shards of the broken floor.</p><p align="justify">Or at least it would have protected him if their spell had done any damage whatsoever.</p><p align="justify">“What the-”</p><p align="justify">Where their spells should have hit, barely visible engravings in the glass began to glow and spread out, forming a complex array of runic circles that progressively lit up the entire floor of the room. They attempted a few other spells, only to face the same result as they dissolved harmlessly on the enchanted surface without leaving as much as a scratch.</p><p align="justify">“Well, that wasn’t the bloody plan.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">Deep in the beating heart of the Ministry’s bureaucracy, entire flights of colourful paper planes flew above the trio’s invisible heads, filling the drab corridors with some much-needed life. More importantly, their coordinated flight served as a perfect Ariadne’s thread in the real labyrinth of offices, record storage and meeting rooms that made up the fifth floor.</p><p align="justify">They advanced in silence, following the planes with their wands at the ready until Ron’s voice came to life in their helmets. The range of the suit’s communicator being limited, it was currently relayed by the communication stone attached to Harry’s suit.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t know about you guys, but we’ve hit a bit of a snag here.”</p><p align="justify">“A snag?”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah ... We secured the map, but it’s well protected and we can’t do anything to it.”</p><p align="justify">“Any idea how long it’ll take to destroy it?”</p><p align="justify">“I’ll call you as soon as we figure out if we even can.”</p><p align="justify">“Great” Harry sighed. ”At least we shouldn’t have any problem finding those reports...”</p><p align="justify">The trio emerged in an enormous circular room, clearly too big to fit on this floor alone. All across the room, a multitude of clerks busied themselves in cubicles overflowing with stacks of papers and parchment. At the centre of the room, a gigantic cylindrical filing cabinet with far too many drawers rose from the floor to the ceiling, like a metallic pillar around which were arranged ten floors of private offices linked by catwalks. The air was abuzz with the sound of a thousand paper planes flying around, filing themselves on desks or in the giant cabinet, where other drawers opened themselves to let new documents fly out and zoom into a hallway.</p><p align="justify">“You know,” Ginny said as they stood at the entrance, transfixed. “I’d joke about Malfoy’s dad compensating for something, but I think we’re long past that point.”</p><p align="justify">“I think this says more about the Ministry itself than the current minister...”</p><p align="justify">“How are we supposed to find what we need in this mess? There could be centuries worth of paperwork in here.”</p><p align="justify">“I think I know...” Ernie said, his eyes fixed on one of the floors above. “Even in a bureaucratic monster like this, there is one place where every piece of information gets abridged and reviewed.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh.” Understanding filled Harry’s voice as his own gaze turned upward, toward a well ornamented door on the first floor adorned with a golden plate. “On the director’s desk.”</p><p align="justify">“Precisely. And I think I see our ticket-in getting up there right now...”</p><hr /><p align="justify">Bookcases filled to the brim, heaps of parchment and filing cabinets stacked on top of each other were arranged around a single desk in the circular office, in a way that mimicked the central record room outside. Documents floated about, occasionally coming down before the eyes of the elderly man settled in a well-worn tall chair that shared his age, to be read and stamped before rolling itself on one of the piles, leaving another parchment to take its place.</p><p align="justify">The soft ticking of a great clock installed against the far wall and the regular sound of the stamp rhythmed the bureaucratic dance as they had done for generations. On the occasion where an error had managed to slip itself into the paperwork, the scratching of a quill and a tap of a wand came to break the monotony of it all.</p><p align="justify">Aldwin Krempet, head of the Department of Archiving and Classifications took great pride in the rarity of such occurrences. The well-oiled machine that he directed had perfected its art since the inception of the Ministry and had bound it with as much red tape as wizardly as possible. If something needed to be done, it would need, among other things, to be ratified three times by seven separate committees, which would in turn need their findings reviewed and approved by a Department Head and the Minister himself.</p><p align="justify">And every time one of these documents was drafted, his department would be called to audit their adherence to the many, many regulations put in place over the years. While most only needed some minor corrections before being submitted anew, others required more peculiar attention.</p><p align="justify">If a proposition was deemed too dangerous, or threatened the foundations of the county’s traditions, its formulation or structure would inevitably be found lacking or going against a great number of regulations at every step. At least until its content was reviewed and brought down to a tamer and less dangerous state. The system had worked splendidly for a long time now and had always managed to curb the excesses of overeager or overambitious ministers.</p><p align="justify">Of course, such actions had to be taken with great care and consideration. While some administrations were easier to work with, the most recent has proven to be quite persistent in their desire to implement sweeping changes to the country. Oh, they had been exceedingly clever and subtle with it, and it had taken weeks for Aldwin to grasp the true nature of these new laws, even with his trained eyes watching over their propositions.</p><p align="justify">The first wave of documents they had submitted the very day the new minister was elected had been well-prepared and absolutely flawless. His staff’s weak attempts at contestations had been easily dealt with, leading to swift reforms and the birth of the new Department Merit. Now, however, it seemed the time for subtlety had passed, and more extreme propositions arrived on his desk each day. The usual tactics were met with increasingly harsh repercussions for those who dared impede the march of the Minister’s agenda.</p><p align="justify">The door was slammed open, breaking both the serene atmosphere and Krempet’s sombre ruminations.</p><p align="justify">A man in a slightly too small Auror trench coat stood at the doorstep, flanked by two men in dark Hit Wizard uniforms and a young secretary.</p><p align="justify">“I must say, Mr. Selwyn, this is highly irregular!” The secretary complained. “I’ll have to make a report to the Minister.”</p><p align="justify">“Well, this isn’t exactly a regular visit either. Isn’t it, Krempet?”</p><p align="justify">The men stepped inside with their wands in hand, leaving the door wide open behind them. No doubt that they wanted this to be a show to serve as an example.</p><p align="justify">“Of course.” Aldwin took great care to roll the parchment in front of him and to tap his wand to send it to the correct pile before looking up at the visitors. “I am, after all, the first Head of Department your masters have decided to arrest openly instead of having me murdered in a back alley like the others. Quite the honour, I must say.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, I like it when they know they’re already done. Still, I would watch my tone if I were you, old man.” Selwyn’s eyes narrowed. “Your treasonous behaviour already landed you in quite a bit of trouble. You wouldn’t want to worsen your case now, would you?”</p><p align="justify">“Mr Selwyn! You are a representative of the Minister’s authority! This is no way to-”</p><p align="justify">Selwyn turned on his heels, his wand raised menacingly toward the taller secretary’s face.</p><p align="justify">“Clam it, Weasley. My orders come from your precious Minister himself. You’re only here as a courtesy. So shut your mouth and take your notes or whatever it is you do, or you’ll join this traitor in Azka-.”</p><p align="justify">One of the drawers of a filing cabinet against the wall opened and came off its tracks. It came crashing down onto the floor with a loud clanking noise, scattering dozens of files at their feet and stopping everyone in the room.</p><p align="justify">“Looks like this whole department is falling apart, just like its head.” With a warning look at Weasley, Selwyn turned back his attention to Krempet. “Now, are you gonna come with us quietly, or are you gonna make this difficult? I was asked to bring you in, but they didn’t say how many parts they wanted you.”</p><p align="justify">“I fear that I am well past misplaced displays of violence. Though I do not doubt my fate will be no different either way.”</p><p align="justify">“What did you expect? Betraying the Ministry has consequences, even for you.”</p><p align="justify">“Betray the Ministry? It is the last thing I or the dozens of unfortunate souls of my staff you have already taken would ever do, young man. And you would know that if you took a bit more from your uncle. At least Desmond did not live to see you disgrace his name.”</p><p align="justify">“I told you to watch your tone, Krempet.” Selwyn walked up to the desk, his jaw set and his grasp on his wand tightening. “I won’t repeat myself again. Now get up!”</p><p align="justify">With a swish of his wand, Selwyn sent the desk crashing into the bookcases covered wall, scattering their content to the ground as he continued toward Krempet, relishing in the unmasked fear he had finally found in the older man’s eyes.</p><p align="justify">“Mr Selwyn!”</p><p align="justify">“I said shut up!” Turning on his heels, Selwyn raised his wand toward Percy Weasley. “Crucio!”</p><p align="justify">Shamed and terrified for the poor man, Aldwin Krempet could not bear to watch this infamy. He looked away as he shut his eyes, waiting in apprehension for screams that never came.</p><p align="justify">Daring to open one of his eyes, he found himself just as baffled as everyone else in the room at the sight of a young girl covered from head to toe in a bulky red and gold armour, standing between Selwyn and Weasley with a crackling shield coming out of her raised arm.</p><hr /><p align="justify">Back in the map room, Ron and his team were busy trying everything they could think of to break the enchanted glass. Every tool, gadget and weapon they had brought with them had been discarded on the floor and their spell repertoires were running dry while they had yet to even chip the glass. Desperate for a solution, Ron had even contacted Hermione using his communication stone, though the engineers’ ideas had proven just as unsuccessful as their own.</p><p align="justify">Leaving the others to their failing attempts after his own ideas encountered a similar fate, Seamus went around to pick up everything they had left lying around, starting with the stun grenades the Weasley twins had provided. The last thing they wanted would be the ministry putting its hand on their technology. Once back to the centre of the room, he turned his attention to the scattered tools and his hand stopped as he was about to pick up one of them.</p><p align="justify">Despite having been dubbed “blow torch”, it looked more like a wrench with both ends closed and enlarged if you asked him. It did not use a flame, but a stream of light of which they could adjust the output, turning its colour from white to purple and everything in between. Now, Seamus didn’t have the slightest clue of how it worked beyond “the darker the light, the hotter it burns”, and the glass had remained impervious to its heat, even after they had followed Terry’s directions to increase its output but maybe...</p><p align="justify">“Hey guys, we could-”</p><p align="justify">He never got the chance to voice his idea, however, as an alarm began to blare in the entire ministry, shocking every one of them to a standstill. Regaining his senses quicker than the others, Ron’s hand flew to his stone and brought it to his mouth.</p><p align="justify">“Harry, what’s going on?”</p><p align="justify">“A bit busy at the—Get down!” Unintelligible shouts and the sounds of a struggle came through the stone for a few moments before Harry could be heard again. “Crap, run for it!”</p><p align="justify">“Put your wands down, all of you! Now!” </p><p align="justify">The shout brought the rest of them out of their shocked trance and they turned around, wand raised to see the guard they had confounded earlier raising his own wand at them from the doorstep. Cowering behind him was the clerk they had duped to open the door, who looked at the slumped forms of his colleagues with a horrified look before turning tail and running away.</p><p align="justify">Snapping into action, Luna lunged forward. As she disappeared from view, her left hand reached to the latches securing her hoverboard to her back.</p><p align="justify">“What the-”</p><p align="justify">Barely a moment later, the guard was blown back into the wall and slipped to the floor, unconscious, while Luna became visible once more.</p><p align="justify">”Secure the room! No one gets in before that map is destroyed!”</p><p align="justify">As they began to move at Ron’s order, Seamus let everything he was holding fall to the ground in a cacophony of metal and glass to grasp Alicia’s wrist before she would leave.</p><p align="justify">“Hey! Watch it, Finnigan.”</p><p align="justify">“Take off your armour.”</p><p align="justify">“The hell?” She scowled at him, and the few others still within earshot gave him scandalised looks while barricading the doors and tying up the clerks. “We don’t have time for your stupid jokes!”</p><p align="justify">“What?” Confused for a second, Seamus gazed over her body and he felt his fice burn up. ”No I ... That’s not ... I've got an idea for the map. But I need heavy armour since they have the most gold and silver in it, and you’re the only one here wearing one. Plus, you’ll still have the suit so...“</p><p align="justify">Alicia’s scowl hardened as she tore her wrist from his grasp and raised her hand. For a brief moment, he thought she was going to slap him, and frankly, he wouldn’t have blamed her. His cheeks would remain unmolested, however, as she brought up her other hand to detach her vambrace and throw it at him before starting to take off the other pieces.</p><p align="justify">“Here. This better work.”</p><p align="justify">Not daring to meet her eyes, Seamus muttered his thanks and knelt down on the floor, picking up the fallen blow torch. Turning it on, he dialled it back to the maximum output, praying that the jury-rigged modification they had done would hold, and brought the business end just above the vambrace he steadied against the grooves on the glass.</p><p align="justify">It took a moment for the magic-resistant alloy to heat up until a small portion on the edge reached its melting point. Ever so slowly, like the sweat that ran down his face under his helmet, it fell into the groove. As soon as the burning metal hit the glass, the glow of the runic circle flickered for an instant before intensifying.</p><p align="justify">Behind him, Seamus heard a door rattle as someone tried to force it open and he really hoped the others had managed to seal them. In the corner of his eye, he could see Ron coming back from one of the side entrances.</p><p align="justify">“Mate, you’re sure this will work?”</p><p align="justify">“I have no idea.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">"This is <em> not </em> how I imagined this mission would go!”</p><p align="justify">Ernie’s complaints were drowned when the wall on their left exploded, sending large chunks of dark stone everywhere as curses and jinxes continued to rain down upon them. A dozen Aurors and Hit Wizards were hot on their heels, shouting death threats and swearing when they weren’t ordering them to stop.</p><p align="justify">He didn’t know how long they had been running. Their escape from the archives had been a blur of shouts and panic after Ginny revealed their presence. They had tried to disappear again and use the chaos to leave unseen, but the invisibility modules had died out with their hoverboards and most of their equipment when an Auror had washed over the entire record room with a spell. Now, all he knew was that his lungs and legs burned and that he would need to compile a list of every insult he would use if he ever came across the one that had designed this maze of a floor.</p><p align="justify">Running clutching a small stack of files to his chest, Ernie outstretched his free arm backwards and waved his wand in wide and well-practised motions. The largest pieces of debris that littered the hallway’s floor sprouted wings and turned into a flock of eagles that swooped down on their pursuers.</p><p align="justify">Bit of a rush job though, the feathers still looked like stone. Thank god McGonagall wasn’t here to see this or she would have taken back his O.W.L...</p><p align="justify">“Funny, that’s pretty much what I expected.” </p><p align="justify">Not to be outdone, Ginny stopped and turned on her heels. She pulled two fanged Frisbees from the magnetic latches on her back and threw them at the Aurors. She didn’t stay to watch them work, however, and she began to run again, hungry growls and pained cries filling the hallway behind them as they came up to an intersection.</p><p align="justify">“Take a left!” Ernie shouted, an idea coming to him. They took the turn and he stopped, making use of the cover offered by the corner to gather himself for a second before raising his wand in jagged movements. </p><p align="justify">“Maceria Lapidea.”</p><p align="justify">The black stone around them seemed to slide on the walls they composed and reached out to fuse into a new wall of solid stone that closed the way behind them.</p><p align="justify">“Good thinking.” Taking advantage of the brief respite himself, Harry brought a hand to the communication stone strapped to his chest. ”Ron, we’re running out of time here. Are you done?”</p><p align="justify">“Not yet. We’re making progress on the barrier, though.”</p><p align="justify">“Well hurry up! We’ll keep them off your back.” Urgently letting go of the stone, Harry brought his forearm up as stone fragments and spells began to fill the air once more. The energy shield shimmered into existence just in time for a curse to splash harmlessly against it.</p><p align="justify">“And how the hell are we supposed to do that?” Ginny shouted as she failed to stop a vicious yellow curse and winced when it crashed on her pauldron. “In case you hadn’t noticed, we’re barely holding on here!”</p><p align="justify">“There’s got to be a way ... Ernie! What’s on this floor?”</p><p align="justify">“Let’s see ... Offices, dusty records, offices, meeting rooms, and ah-yes, more offices.”</p><p align="justify">“Not helping, Mcmillan!”</p><p align="justify">“Just ... Keep running, OK? We’ll figure something out.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">The glow of the intersecting runic circles engraved on the glass floor flickered dimly as the molten metal flowed and pooled through the grooves, filling every nook and cranny. What remained of Alicia’s greaves pained and gave in to the heat of the blow torch as Seamus moved it with focus and tired hands.</p><p align="justify">All around him, the sounds and shouts of battle echoed through the cavernous hall, his teammates defending their position from the assault of Aurors and Hit Wizards alike. On Ron’s order, they had collapsed two of the entrances to focus their defences around a single door, though it had long been overrun by the ministry’s forces and the battle had moved to the barricades made of overturned desks.</p><p align="justify">Sparks flew off the burning metal and Seamus flinched back to protect his exposed arms before getting back to work. His own vambraces, while not composed of nearly as much magic-resistant metals as Alicia’s armour, had already shared the same fate. The difference between the two armours and their effects on the enchantment had been stark, and he soon had to suffer Alicia’s fury as he asked her to shed more of her protective plating while they ducked under spellfire.</p><p align="justify">“Almost there...”</p><p align="justify">When he completely filled the circle, the connections holding the enchantment broke and the glowing finally died down.</p><p align="justify">“I got it!”</p><p align="justify">Taking a step back, Seamus took out his wand and vanished a portion of the glass at the centre of the metal-filled circle, a nervous laugh escaping from his lips as it disappeared without resistance.</p><p align="justify">“Incendio.”</p><p align="justify">A gout of flames emerged from his wand and plunged into the hole in the floor, turning purple as it quickly engulfed the century-old parchment and spread out under the floor of the entire room. It looked like he was running above an inferno as he rejoined the others behind the barricade, where Ron had already taken out his communication stone.</p><p align="justify">“Harry, we’re done.”</p><p align="justify">“About time!”</p><p align="justify">“We need to find a new way out. They’ll have the atrium locked down by now.”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, we figured that out. Ernie tells me the Department of Transports is right below us on the sixth floor. They should have a porkey or a fireplace we can use.”</p><p align="justify">“You sure?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s not like we have a lot of options at the moment. We’ll distract them a bit longer, but you better get your arse down here fast.”</p><p align="justify">“Alright, but try not to get yourself nearly killed, for once. I promised Hermione I’d bring you back in one piece.” Pocketing the stone in his modified suit, Ron took out his hoverboard and looked at his team. ”Time to disappear, mates. Let’s ride.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">“How did they even manage to replicate the gravity?”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t know, but remind me to thank them once we’re back.”</p><p align="justify">Ernie’s entire body felt like one big bruise, his left arm hung limply at his side and he was pretty sure he had broken at least a couple of ribs, making every breath a painful experience. It did not stop the smile spreading on his face, however, as they finally stopped running at the end of a hallway on the sixth floor, which had mercifully been built by someone less enamoured with the tale of the Minotaur.</p><p align="justify">Their chase through the corridors had almost ended in disaster when the Auror’s reinforcement arrived from the other floors and trapped them in a hallway with no way out. Vastly outnumbered and out of options, Harry had taken out one of the last items they had not used already, a prototype of Fred and George he had brought at their insistence. With most of their equipment out of order, he had not expected it to actually work, but let it never be said that the twins failed to surprise him at every turn.</p><p align="justify">The unassumingly small silver box with a big blue button on top had unfolded itself and turned the entire hallway into a perfect replica of empty space, complete with stars and a disturbing lack of gravity. As he understood, the twins had repurposed one of their old inventions called a Portable Swamp to fit in the theme of the Enterprise as a new product. Using their own experience of spacewalks, and at times using the flailing Aurors and Hit Wizards as stepping stones, the three of them had made their way out of the box’s range and found their way to the floor below.</p><p align="justify">“Still ... It’s strange we haven’t seen anyone on this floor yet.”</p><p align="justify">“Maybe they evacuated when they rang the alarm?”</p><p align="justify">“Maybe...”</p><p align="justify">With Ginny covering their rear in case their pursuers found them again, Harry went ahead to peek around the corner.</p><p align="justify">“This is it. And Ron’s team is already here.”</p><p align="justify">Propping himself up against the wall,  his good arm still grasping the files tightly against his chest, Ernie joined him to take a look. After a few metres, the corridor gave way to an oblong room painted from floor to ceiling with crisscrossing lines, their intersections marked with vivid green dots. The room itself housed a few desks on both ends, but most of the space was taken by a massive fire pit burning with green fire and surrounded by raised stones that would not have been out of place in Stonehenge. </p><p align="justify">On the other side of the room, he could see the silhouettes of their five invisible crew mates.</p><p align="justify">“Wait, they can still turn invisible? That’s <em> so </em> unfair.”</p><p align="justify">“You can tell them that in person in a-”</p><p align="justify">“Harry!” Ginny exclaimed. “Incoming!”</p><p align="justify">“Crap!” Harry brought a hand to his communication stone. “We got company. Let’s move!”</p><p align="justify">Not wasting a second, Ron’s group rushed forward and spread out around the room, checking hiding spots and casting detection charms to find any ambushers. By the time Harry helped Ernie to sit on a stone at the feet of the fire pit, their search had found nothing, however, and they allowed themselves a moment to relax before the storm hit.</p><p align="justify">“Ginny, Luna and Katie. Watch the Doors. Seamus and Alicia, use those desks and block the door, but don’t touch the stones.” Ron ordered, walking up to them. “Glad to see you in one piece.” His gaze strayed a second too long on Ernie. “Mostly.”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, good to see you managed to make it out. Things got a bit tricky there for a second.”</p><p align="justify">“We’re not out yet.” Ron turned toward the pit that burned with abandon not a metre from them, yet brought them no heat. “What now? Do we just ... jump in?”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t know...” Ernie mused. “Usually, you’d need some Floo powder before the flames turn green, but ... this doesn’t seem to work like that.”</p><p align="justify">“I doubt they would leave it in the open like that if it was dangerous. There’d be railings or something.” Harry said. “Then again, knowing wizards...”</p><p align="justify">“If this is the heart of the Floo network, or at least what’s regulating it, then it must be connected to the fireplaces. Every fireplace. We could come out anywhere in the country.”</p><p align="justify">“Anywhere’s better than here, I say. Either way, once we’re out, we can just apparate back at the shop and-”</p><p align="justify">“They’re here!”</p><p align="justify">Katie’s warning came a second too late.</p><p align="justify">A passive explosion took out their hastily made barricade and a good chunk of the wall with it, throwing them to the ground. </p><p align="justify">Pained cries filled the air, but none were as loud as Ernie’s, who had landed hard on his broken arm. His eyes were brimming with tears that blurred his vision and his ears were filled by a strident whistle as pain shot through his entire left side. He could hear the distant voices of the others in his helmet, panicking and shouting muted words as he struggled to lift his battered body away from his arm. A task made that much more difficult by the fact that he could not feel his legs.</p><p align="justify">That was probably a bad sign...</p><p align="justify">With the pain subsiding and his eyes furiously blinking away the tears, his senses sluggishly came back to him. A look around him revealed the chaos of battle, the Aurors flowing into the room en-masse while Seamus, Katie and Ginny tried to slow them down, fallen stones giving them some cover. Harry was running in his direction, dodging spellfire as he went, a shield deployed. More worryingly, the others were nowhere to be found.</p><p align="justify">“Ernie!” Harry knelt down beside him, his shield arm raised to cover them. “Ernie, you’re still with us?”</p><p align="justify">“Captain...”</p><p align="justify">“Alright, stay with me. The others fell into the fire. We’re going too.”</p><p align="justify">“Harry ... The files...” The reason everything had gone wrong. The reason why they had risked the mission and suffered the consequences. His own idea. “Where...” In his fall, his grasp had faltered and the files were blown away. His attempts at extending his neck to look for them only gave birth to new spikes of pain in his back. “I’m sorry, I-”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t worry about that. We need-”</p><p align="justify">“Harry!”</p><p align="justify">He could see Harry look up in the direction of the others and tense.</p><p align="justify">They were out of time.</p><p align="justify">And they both knew it.</p><p align="justify">“Go!” Harry shouted to the others, spells crashing on his flickering shield as he attempted to pass his free arm behind Ernie’s back. “Into the fire!”</p><p align="justify">“Not without you!”</p><p align="justify">“I gave you an order! We’ll be right behind you!”</p><p align="justify">Harry pulled hard, trying to get him back up, and suddenly Ernie shouted his throat raw pain as he could see and feel his legs once again.</p><p align="justify">His broken, mangled and flattened legs.</p><p align="justify">One of the massive stones had fallen on top of him, breaking itself and reducing his legs to a bloody mess.</p><p align="justify">Something hit Harry hard, and they fell to the ground once more.</p><p align="justify">Pushing himself back up, Harry raised his shield again and sent a few spells of his own toward the Aurors. </p><p align="justify">Trying to turn to see how close they had come, Ernie finally found it.</p><p align="justify">Hidden beneath the rubble, just within arm’s reach...</p><p align="justify">His wand.</p><p align="justify">“Harry...”</p><p align="justify">“Give me-Crap!-Give me a second.”</p><p align="justify">Ernie’s hand closed around his wand.</p><p align="justify">“Harry ... You’ve got to go.”</p><p align="justify">“We’re both getting out of here. Then you can scold me all night about my responsibilities or whatever you want.”</p><p align="justify">Ernie brought his arm back and raised it.</p><p align="justify">“Harry. Captain.” Finally, he turned from the battle to look his way. The blank, featureless metal of the helmet hid his face and made him look almost alien. “Thanks. And goodbye.”</p><p align="justify">“Ernie, no!”</p><p align="justify">“Depulso.”</p><p align="justify">He could almost see the shock on Harry’s face as he was pushed back into the fire and disappeared as if eaten by the green flames.</p><p align="justify">Giving out a pained groan, Ernie rolled himself on his back. The battle around him had died out and he could already hear the Aurors approaching.</p><p align="justify">He could only hope that the others had all made it out.</p><p align="justify">The dark, crisscrossed and dotted ceiling above him looked like a weird artistic rendition of a night sky filled with stars.</p><p align="justify">It was weird, how he had gotten so used to seeing the stars since they had found Requirement. Just peek out the window and you can see the entire Milky Way looking right back at you.</p><p align="justify">He would have liked to see it one last time.</p><p align="justify">The footsteps were getting closer. Time to finish this then.</p><p align="justify">He had insisted on coming along, and his idea was the reason the entire mission went pear-shaped. He’d even lost the files in the end.</p><p align="justify">Gathering what little strength he had left, Ernie raised a trembling hand toward the star-dotted ceiling.</p><p align="justify">Today had just been one screw-up after the other.</p><p align="justify">But there was one last thing he could do to make up for it.</p><p align="justify">He could hear the Aurors shouting again. They’d spotted him.</p><p align="justify">Steadying his hand, Ernie tightened his grasp on his wand.</p><p align="justify">It was a good wand.</p><p align="justify">Ten and a half inches. Willow and Unicorn hair. Springy, but with a temperament.</p><p align="justify">He liked his wand.</p><p align="justify">A shame it would go out with him.</p><p align="justify">“Sorry, mum ... I’m not coming home.” Under his helmet, tears flowed freely down his face, and he struggled to keep a strained smile. “Bombarda Maxima!”</p><p align="justify">With a flick of the wrist, the ceiling exploded, bringing several tons of stone crashing down on him, and everyone else in the room.</p>

  <p align="justify">The emerald inferno whirled all around him, flinging him across the flames like a pebble in a storm.</p><p align="justify">How long had it been since he’d jumped into the pit? Since he had lost sight of the others? Everything swirled too fast to see and time had no meaning. His bruised ribs and his mangled hand flared up in pain every time the burning currents twisted his body. Had the magic not paralysed him, he would already have thrown up.</p><p align="justify">All he knew was that there had to be an end to this insanity. He would come back out into the real world at some point.</p><p align="justify">He had to.</p><p align="justify">Something hit him hard in the back of the head, and Seamus knew no more.</p><hr /><p align="justify">“Firewhiskey, Freddy? Really?”</p><p align="justify">“Doug, it’s not even eleven. I’m not takin’ out the good stuff before the Falcons break into the hundreds.”</p><p align="justify">Frederick Bates, a middle-aged man with a receding hairline hidden under a floppy hat, put down a large bottle and two glasses on the table. Douglas Collins, who had been fiddling with the wireless until then, popped open the bottle and filled the glasses generously with a wave of his wand.</p><p align="justify">“Wasps’ new keeper would put Puddlemere’s to shame, I tell ya. They won’t make it past thirty.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh yeah? Care to put down some sickles on that? The brand new couch you won me last month could use some-”</p><p align="justify">The unmistakable sound of bursting flames and a heavy thud echoed through the house. Their banter stopped before it could truly begin, the men exchanged uncertain looks until Douglas turned down the volume of the wireless.</p><p align="justify">“Ya didn’t invite Robert, did ya?”</p><p align="justify">“After last time? He’d better be hopin’ I don’t hex his arse back to Wales next I see him... Wands out you reckon?”</p><p align="justify">“Gotta be these days...”</p><p align="justify">Wands in hand, they made their way to the living room, finding it covered in soot and dust, dark rock fragments littering the carpeted floor. Sprawled out in front of the fireplace was the prone body of a child, clad in a strange gold bodysuit with red parts that looked like those old armours back in Hogwarts.</p><p align="justify">“Barnaby’s butt, the couch! Look at it!”</p><p align="justify">“It’s just soot, ya pillock” Douglas approached the prone form on the ground, pokin’ him with the tip of his feet while Freddy vainly waved his wand above the ruined sofa. “Oi, kid. Ya better have ol’ Grindle after your arse to get in here like that or I-”</p><p align="justify">“Stop yappin’. Boy’s knocked out.”</p><p align="justify">“How’d you know he’s a boy?”</p><p align="justify">“I have eyes, nitwit. He don’t got lady parts.”</p><p align="justify">Douglas humphed as he knelt beside the boy, slipping his hand around the armoured plates to palpate his neck in search of a pulse. After a few moments of awkward flailing, he took the helmet with both hands and pulled. It hissed when he removed it, uncovering the blood caked face of an unconscious dark-haired boy.</p><p align="justify">“Don’t think that’s normal.”</p><p align="justify">“What’d we do? Ain’t no way I’m callin’ the Aurors cause my floo threw up a dead kid!”</p><p align="justify">“Hang on, alright? Ya pick him up and I go grab a shovel from-”</p><p align="justify">“Merlin’s saggy bollocks, he’s still breathin’!”</p><hr /><p align="justify">“And if you don’t forget to burn the incense at the feet of your bed every night, the feathers should be gone by next week, Ms. Genfried.”</p><p align="justify">“Thank you my dear. Bit of a shame, though. The green was pairing so well with my favourite cardigan.”</p><p align="justify">Reginald Swansforth, one of the youngest Healers on staff at St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, was guiding his elderly patient toward the entrance hall with a strained smile.</p><p align="justify">“Now, now. They might be pretty, but you wouldn’t want to be covered from head to toe. And think of the shedding once summer comes around.”</p><p align="justify">“You’re right, as always.” Ms. Genfried smiled widely in his direction, her milky eyes looking right past him. “You always were the clever one, Tommy.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m not-” Reginald sighed. “Never mind. We’re here.”</p><p align="justify">Ms. Genfried was a sweet lady, although her mind wasn’t all there anymore. Lost with her husband in the war he had been told.</p><p align="justify">Poor woman.</p><p align="justify">This did not fail to fan the flames of Reginald’s simmering annoyance, however. He had been here more than four years already, and still he remained at the bottom of the totem pole, only to be given minor cases like hers. Not that she didn’t deserve to be healed any less than anyone else, Morgana blessed her, but he had not graduated at the top of his class and worked his arse off apprenticing for eight years to remove feathers and foot fungus.</p><p align="justify">They arrived in the entrance hall and Reginald carefully guided his charge toward the row of fireplaces on the far wall. Like any other day the hall was filled with patients and visitors waiting to be let in. From a man with large butterfly wings for ears, a small girl who let out colourful balloons every time she hiccuped to someone whose behind had fused with a bar stool, the sights of the entrance hall never failed to surprise.</p><p align="justify">Different from any other day, however, were the growing lines in front of the fireplaces. A man tried to step through the floo by throwing some powder and saying a name, only to jump back with a pained shout when the fire flared, lacking its usual green tint.</p><p align="justify">“Ms. Genfried, I fear I’ll have to leave you in the hands of one of our nurses.” Raising a hand, Reginald signalled a man in the green and white uniform of the hospital to come and care for his charge. “Something appears to be wrong with our fireplaces.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, don’t fret, Tommy. I understand. Always trying to help. That’s why Marianne always had her eye on you, you know?”</p><p align="justify">“If you say so. Have a good day M. Genfried, and don’t forget the incense.”</p><p align="justify">Walking away as the nurse arrived, Reginald took the direction of the fireplaces, where increasingly infuriated visitors were quickly getting short on patience and covered in soot.</p><p align="justify">“Now, what seems to be the prob-”</p><p align="justify">The chime of the main door rang in the hall, turning a few heads, and quickly left its place for horrified gasps and more than one cry.</p><p align="justify">A man had come out of the brick wall that served as the front door, holding soot covered teenager in his arms. The child was dressed in a strange-looking armour whose tint approached that of the blood covering the back of his head and his mangled hand.</p><p align="justify">“Everyone, out of the way!” Reginald shouted, coming out of his shocked stupor as he rushed to the man’s side. “Maddie, get a trauma kit!“</p><p align="justify">While one of the nurses behind the front desk hurried to the back room, Reginald arrived at the door, taking in the man’s bewildered expression. Wasting no time, he checked for a pulse before opening one the teen’s eyelids and bringing his lit-up wand in front of it, checking the pupil’s reaction.</p><p align="justify">“Is this your son?”</p><p align="justify">“No he’s-I don’t know who he is. I just found him and-I didn’t do nothing! He-He’s hurt and-”</p><p align="justify">“Calm down, please. It’s alright.” The nurse arrived, a large leather bag with the Hospital emblem embroidered onto it in her hands. “Thanks. Now this way, quickly.”</p><p align="justify">The bag in hand, Reginald left the hall in a hurried pace, the man and the nurse following after him. His steps led them to the nearest observation room he could find, which was thankfully unoccupied.</p><p align="justify">“Put him down on the bed, please. Gently.”</p><p align="justify">Setting the bag on one of the counters, Reginald began to take out the potion and medical instruments it contained.</p><p align="justify">“You’ve done well bringing him here, mister...”</p><p align="justify">“Doug. Douglas Collins. Me and my mate Fred, we was just listenin’ to the game, you know, when the kid-”</p><p align="justify">“Thank you, Mister Collins. Why don’t you go with Maddison here and tell her all that happened while I take care of him, alright?”</p><p align="justify">“I... Alright.”</p><p align="justify">As the muttering man was led away by the comforting nurse, Reginald opened one of the vials and soaked a compress with it before carefully applying it on the back of the teenager’s head. Satisfied with its application, he then brought his wand up and began casting charms on the boy to detect any trace of residual hex or curse. His eyebrows rose high in surprise, however, when every single one of his spells fizzled out as they made contact with the strange armour.</p><p align="justify">This was new.</p><hr /><p align="justify">An hour after the commotion had died down in the entrance hall, a man in a too-short Auror trench coat barged in with half a dozen of his colleagues. More than one seemed slightly injured and all were covered in dust. Patients and visitors alike hurried out of their way as some walked up to the reception desk, sombre and furious expressions on their faces while the others scattered, roughly searching the crowd.</p><p align="justify">“W-Welcome to St Mung-”</p><p align="justify">“I want every patient who arrived in the last hour.” The witch was struck mute, her mouth hanging half-open uselessly as Selwyn leaned forward, bringing his face right before her own. “Now.”</p><p align="justify">“I-I can’t. The privacy of our patients-” She tried to back away, only for Selwyn to grab her wrist with force. “What are you doing! Let me-” Her eyes widened and filled themselves with terror as the Auror’s sleeve was pulled back by her struggle, revealing a vivid mark moving on his left arm.</p><p align="justify">Noticing her stare, Selwyn brusquely pulled her back toward him and brought up his wand, lowering back his sleeve in the same movement.</p><p align="justify">“I won’t ask again. Were. Are. They?”</p><p align="justify">The witch raised a trembling hand toward one of the hallways.</p><p align="justify">“R-Room sixteen.”</p><p align="justify">Selwyn released his grip, letting her fall back heavily on her chair as he pulled back his coat into place. Every trace of anger disappeared from his face as an easy expression and a toothy smile took its place.</p><p align="justify">“See? That wasn’t so hard.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">The first thing Seamus noticed when he regained consciousness was the massive headache that seemed to have replaced his brain. Groaning, he tried to open his eyes, only for treacherous rays of light to pierce them, sending new spikes of pain through his head before he could shut them close.</p><p align="justify">“Ah, you’re awake. Good.” The man’s voice was unfamiliar but friendly. It would be even more if he took pity on his poor head and spoke a lot quieter. “I’ll admit that I have a few questions for you, kid. It’s not every day we get visitors like you around here.”</p><p align="justify">“Where ... Where am I? What happened?”</p><p align="justify">“I was kind of hoping you could tell me.”</p><p align="justify">Seamus managed to open his eyes once more, this time forcing them to endure the light, yet despite his best efforts, his vision remained blurry. He only managed to make out large green and white blobs all around him, and the indistinct silhouette of the man standing at what he now realised was his bedside.</p><p align="justify">“Who—Who are you?”</p><p align="justify">“I’m Healer Swansforth, and I’ve been treating your injuries. Could you tell me what happened?”</p><p align="justify">“I ... I remember holding the line ... The Captain shouting ... We were running and-” The flames. The pain. And then nothing. With his memories returning, his vision finally cleared up. The sea green walls, the white furniture, the man with the robes sharing the colour scheme and adorned with a crossed wand and bone in what was unmistakably a hospital, albeit a magic one. ”This is-I can’t-”</p><p align="justify">He tried to get up, only to lean heavily on the bed as he faltered, blood rushing to his head and legs too weak to support him. He could feel the hands of the healer on his back and shoulder, steadying him.</p><p align="justify">“Easy now. You’re in no condition to run around. I haven’t finished healing your hand and you need to rest as much as possible. On that note, you should avoid all strenuous activities, including apparition, for the next few-”</p><p align="justify">“You don’t understand. I can’t be here.”</p><p align="justify">The sudden rebuttal seemed to shock the healer for a moment until his features softened and a small smile tugged at his lips.</p><p align="justify">“It’s alright. I don’t know how you managed to injure yourself like that, but I’m sure your parents won’t be mad.”</p><p align="justify">“You don’t know my mum.” Laughing felt weird. Like his lungs and throat weren’t used to it. “But I mean what I said. I can’t be here. There’s probably Death Eaters on their way already.”</p><p align="justify">“Death Eaters, really?” The healer gave him an awfully familiar disbelieving look from above his glasses. Maybe he did know his mum after all. “You should work on coming up with more tasteful excuses, kid. There are certain things you really shouldn’t joke about.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m not joking. I was ...” His head felt so heavy, it was hard to think. He brought a hand to it, hoping to soothe the pain by steadying it. “I was at the Ministry. They were going after the kids. We couldn’t-”</p><p align="justify">“You were hurt at the Ministry?” The healer - Swansforth, was it? - frowned. “Is that where you got this stuff?” Following the pointed look at a table, Seamus discovered what remained of his armoured plating, or at least the top part of it. Looking down, he could see that his suit had been peeled down to his hips, revealing a nasty black bruise that covered a good portion of his right side.</p><p align="justify">“That’s...” Hastily pulling the suit back into place, Seamus tried to stand once more, only to be stopped by a more forceful hand that sat him back on the bed. “That’s mine. I’d probably be dead without it, I think.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m not surprised. That’s quite the armour you got here. It was a pain to remove it so I could heal you, though.” Another attempt at moving from the bed was put down by Swansforth’s grip on his aching and tired shoulder. “I said take it easy. You won’t be going home for a few days at least. In the meantime, my boss would love to know where you-”</p><p align="justify">Loud thumping sounds cut the unwelcome query, as the only door in the room rattled violently.</p><p align="justify">“Who the hell-”</p><p align="justify">“Aurors! Open immediately!”</p><p align="justify">The grip on Seamus’ shoulder slackened as the Healer’s shocked gaze went from the door to him.</p><p align="justify">“Please.” He looked up at the man, pleading. “I need to get out of here. They’ll kill me.”</p><p align="justify">Swansforth finally released his shoulder, wearing a painfully forced reassuring expression on his face as he walked to the door.</p><p align="justify">“Whatever you did at the Ministry, I’m sure they’ll understand.”</p><p align="justify">“They might be Aurors, but they all wear the mark on their arm.”</p><p align="justify">The Healer’s hand stopped just short of the rattling handle. The men outside were still shouting their commands for him to seize it and let them in, but his attention was entirely focused on Seamus’ pleasing eyes.</p><p align="justify">For all his training and armour, Seamus felt so frail and vulnerable in this moment that seemed to stretch forever.</p><p align="justify">“Please.”</p><p align="justify">Swansforth’s hand fell back to his side while the men outside banged on the door with renewed fervour. His wand swished through the air, opening the window with a soft click and revealing the emergency staircase behind it.</p><p align="justify">“You’re damn lucky this was the closest room available.”</p><p align="justify">Seamus released a shaky breath, feeling like a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders. Bracing himself, he finally managed to stand up on uncertain legs. Propping himself against the bed, he walked up to the window, where Swansforth met him, an improvised bag made with a bed sheet in hand.</p><p align="justify">“You’ll need these, I take it.” Taking the bundle, Seamus could feel the weight of his armour inside. ”I’d advise you not to run, but it might be unavoidable given the situation.”</p><p align="justify">“Thank you.” Seamus pushed the bag through the window before he heaved his leg across the sill. He was about to bring the rest of his body through when he stopped and looked back. “Come with me. They won’t be happy when they see you’ve helped me run.”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t worry about me, kid. I’ll be alright. Now go.”</p><p align="justify">Feeling hands push his back, Seamus crossed the sill and landed on the metal staircase.</p><p align="justify">“And get someone to look at your right hand, ok?”</p><p align="justify">With that, Swansforth closed the window and drew the blinds, disappearing from Seamus’ view. He could hear the sound of something heavy being dragged on the wooden floor as he picked up the bag and began his descent, sparing one last glance at the window.</p><p align="justify">Hurrying down the stairs as fast as his legs would allow, Seamus dug through his improvised bag until his hand closed around a familiar rounded shape. Taking it out, he brought the communication stone to his mouth.</p><p align="justify">“Anyone there? I’m still alive, but I wouldn’t say no to a side-along pick-up right about now.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">The door to his quarters opened with a soft hiss and Harry walked in, not bothering to activate the lights. Mars shone in the distance beyond the window, bathing the already red room in a carmine hue. Discarding his helmet on the bed, he walked up to his desk, still covered in data slates and piles of unread reports. Ignoring the chair, he leaned on it and picked up one of the slates.</p><p align="justify">Seamus, the last unaccounted member of their strike team had been found and brought back onboard and was now resting in the ship’s infirmary with the other injured. Harry’s own shoulder cramped in pain every time he stretched it the wrong way, but he had refused to stay with them.</p><p align="justify">How could he stay among them when they had been injured by his decisions? When Ernie died because he gave-in to Ginny and agreed with Ernie’s plan? When he had failed to guide them safely as soon as they had walked into danger together? When he had pulled them in this war to begin with?</p><p align="justify">Captain? Admiral?</p><p align="justify">What a joke.</p><p align="justify">He should have stood his ground and refused all of it. Kept them safe in orbit. Maybe bringing their families on board if necessary, secrecy be damned. In a few months, they wouldn’t even be in the solar system any more, so why should they care about such a small country? What had it ever done for them, except perpetuate centuries of prejudice and cower when things got hard?</p><p align="justify">Why should he care?</p><p align="justify">They could leave it all behind and explore the stars, maybe find another planet to call their own, Voldemort and fickle wizards be damned.</p><p align="justify">If only he’d done any of this instead...</p><p align="justify">Tears of rage, shame, grief and impotence blurred his vision and dropped on the slate, breaking the silence that permeated the room like it did a tomb.</p><p align="justify">With a shout, Harry let it all come out for the first time since the graveyard, sweeping the desk and throwing everything on it to the floor.</p><p align="justify">His trembling knees gave in and he sat down, his back to the desk as the tears continued to flow freely down his face.</p><hr /><p align="justify">It had been days since the debacle at the Ministry, and it seemed to all like the combat team had brought back the dread and gloom that filled Wizarding Britain back to their stellar oasis. The carefree attitude and tense anticipation had been replaced by a veil of doom and grief. Even the stars’ shine seemed to have dimmed.</p><p align="justify">The hushed whispers in the corridors of the station had spread the news and the fears they brought. The Daily Prophet had printed a special issue entirely dedicated to what they had dubbed an act of muggle-born terrorism. The terrorists, having failed in their attempt at assassinating the Minister, had been cornered by the Aurors in the lower levels of the Ministry. There, they had decided to take their own lives and to bring with them as many innocents as they could by collapsing the level above on top of the heart of the Floo Network.</p><p align="justify">No mention had been made of the apparent age of the “terrorists”, or even of Ernie. Either they could not identify the body or they did not want it known that they had been dealt a severe blow by school children. In any case, the crew had decided to keep to Hogwarts when they got back to Earth for now, just to be safe.</p><p align="justify">There were talks of Dumbledore summoning Harry to his office, but no one knew what had happened there. Had they talked of Ernie? Had Dumbledore learned the true nature of their activities? Was that why Sprout had looked so crestfallen the previous day? Will the headmaster try to put a stop to their work? </p><p align="justify">Rumours and theories ran rampant, while the truth remained locked behind the closed doors of Harry’s room. Despite the restlessness of everyone on board, the Captain had only been seen out of his room since he had come back from the Ministry.</p><p align="justify">At Ernie’s funeral.</p><p align="justify">The circumstances being what they were, they could not afford to organise a public funeral, so they held a private ceremony on the ship. Since they had nobody to bury and none of his relatives could be brought on board, it had been a sombre and quiet affair. Beautiful, though. For a moment, the main hold of the ship, cleared out for the occasion, had lit up like the night sky as they raised their wands to their fallen comrade. </p><p align="justify">They had shared stories in hushed whispers and shed tears before sending the few belongings they could not return to his family into space. Their trajectory had been calculated by Lee to keep them in a stable orbit around Neptune, so a part of him could always look after them like he had done for the past year.</p><p align="justify">The next day, Hermione had been heard saying that the Captain had gone to break the news to Ernie’s parents. If one was to believe her, it had gone ... poorly.</p><p align="justify">Amongst their fears and doubts, one thing was certain in the mind of the crew.</p><p align="justify">If the Captain continued to shut himself off, this war and their dream of a great adventure through the stars were doomed.</p><hr /><p align="justify">The knocks on his door echoed through the room, like they had every day since he had locked it.</p><p align="justify">“You can’t keep on like this, mate. You have to come out.”</p><p align="justify">The knocks kept coming, only to be answered by the silence reigning inside.</p><p align="justify">“I’m not taking no for an answer today, Harry. Alohomora.”</p><p align="justify">With a clunking sound, the door finally opened, revealing the disorder beyond. Scrolls, books, clothes, bed sheets and discarded plates littered the floor while the furniture had been knocked over. The Gryffindor banner had been torn down and burnt before its remains had been bundled in a corner.</p><p align="justify">Carefully stepping in, Ron went around the bed to find him sitting on the ground, his back to the bed. His tired features were accentuated by the pale light of Neptune in the darkness of the room.</p><p align="justify">“Well, you look like shit.”</p><p align="justify">For a moment, Ron thought he wouldn’t answer, continuing to ignore his presence like he had done for the last five days. After a while though, he finally talked, his raspy voice grating to hear after so long.</p><p align="justify">“What do you want?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s been almost a week. You already kicked out Hermione and Ginny’s as much of a mess as you. You can’t stay in here forever so,“ Ron raised the Quaffle in his hands for him to see. “I’m dragging your arse out of here.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m not in the mood, Ron. Just leave me alone.”</p><p align="justify">“Didn’t I make myself clear?” He grabbed Harry’s underarm and pulled him up. “I said I was getting you out of here, and I’m damn well gonna do it.”</p><p align="justify">Physically and mentally spent, Harry did not offer much resistance after that and allowed himself to be dragged back to the castle and down to the snow covered grounds. More than one curious or aghast look were sent their way, but Ron did not slow his pace until they had reached the Quidditch pitch. Once there, he threw one of the school brooms at Harry, who caught it, only to look at it for a moment, as if he didn’t know what to do with it.</p><p align="justify">Once in the air, they passed the Quaffle between them in silence for a few minutes, Harry’s half-hearted attempts barely managing to keep up with Ron’s.</p><p align="justify">“You’re thinking that it’s your fault.” Ron said matter-of-factly, breaking the almost comfortable silence once Harry started to put more strength in his throws. “That you shouldn’t have caved to Ginny and that we should have stayed away from the fight. That way, Ernie would still be there.”</p><p align="justify">The sudden affirmation, neither accepting nor judging, took Harry by surprise and he almost failed to catch the Quaffle when it came to him.</p><p align="justify">“That’s not-”</p><p align="justify">“No? Then what is it? You’ve been holding back. Keeping us away from danger because you wanted to take all the risks yourself by helping Dumbledore. Just like you’ve always done. And now that you did allow us to get out and fight, Ernie died.”</p><p align="justify">Harry’s brow furrowed in frustration and anger, but his mouth remained shut. His jaw was set as he threw the ball backwards. </p><p align="justify">“Thing is, it wasn’t up to you. It never was.” Ron circled around Harry, catching the ball before it could lose too much altitude. “You may be the Captain, but it's our fight too. For our families, for our home, for our friends...” He sent him back the Quaffle, his eyes looking straight at Harry’s. “Don’t we deserve the chance to fight for them too? Wasn’t that the whole idea in the first place?”</p><p align="justify">“Ok, you know what?” Harry caught the ball and threw it back with force. “You’re right! This is exactly why I didn’t want us to fight like that in the first place. We weren’t ready!” He caught the Quaffle again, preparing himself to send it back. “We should have stayed on the ship, kept training and building and, and ... and we didn’t.” He let the ball slip from his fingers and fall. “And Ernie’s gone.”</p><p align="justify">Ron stared at him for a second, before diving toward the ground. Twisting in mid-air, he hit the Quaffle with the brambles of his broom, sending it back up and snatching it out of the air as he levelled back with Harry, the ball securely under his arm.</p><p align="justify">“I didn’t really know Ernie. But I know he was a right bloke who believed in what we’re doing. He didn't volunteer for the mission on a whim. We all knew the risks and how much was at stake. Sure, we took some blows and lost more than we thought we could, but we completed the mission.”</p><p align="justify">They floated above the pitch, unbound from everything like they were from gravity, the soft wind blowing in their hair and robes as Harry looked down at the ground, refusing to meet his eyes.</p><p align="justify">“How many families do you think they would have killed this week if we hadn’t? Or next month? Despite everything, we did the right thing. And deep down, I know you know that.”</p><p align="justify">Silence fell on them once more, disturbed only by the quiet murmurs of the wind and the distant shouts of students playing in the melting snow.</p><p align="justify">After a while, Ron pushed his broom forward, intent on bringing them back down. He stopped, however, when Harry spoke again, his voice so quiet it could have been lost in the wind.</p><p align="justify">"Every time I lead people into danger, something goes wrong and they're the ones paying the price. The chessboard, the chamber, the graveyard, the ministry ... my parents ... even your father. People keep dying for me, Ron. Why? Why do I get to live and not them? How is that fair? Where does it stop?"</p><p align="justify">“It’s not. Nothing really is when there’s a mad man like you-know-who out there. But they made their choices. And you made yours.”</p><p align="justify">Ron leaned his broom forward, bringing him next to Harry and put a hand on his shoulder.</p><p align="justify">“You're the captain, you accepted that role. It doesn’t just mean you get to order us around and stop us when we go too far. It's your job making those decisions and sometimes ... Sometimes our best is not enough. And we have to live with the consequences. But shutting yourself down like this? That’s not you. You get back up and keep trying. Not because you need to get your revenge or because you’re callous enough not to care, but because there are still people worth saving.”</p><p align="justify">Gripping the handle of his broom again, Ron began to slowly drift back down.</p><p align="justify">“We both know you’re better than this. When you’re done wallowing in your guilt, I promise you one thing. Whatever we face, we'll face together, like we always did. But this time, you’ll have all of us standing right beside you. And I'll be damned if I ever stop doing my best to get everyone home safe.”</p><p align="justify">With one last throw, the Quaffle spun in the air until Harry caught it with both hands.</p><p align="justify">“So I’ll be waiting for you. We all will.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">With a single step, Harry left behind the freezing air of the castle and entered the carefully controlled temperature of the Requirement. Ron had left him alone with his thoughts hours ago, and although winter was nearing its end, the nights in the Scottish highlands were never warm.</p><p align="justify">He hadn’t wanted to go back to the ship. Not just yet. He still needed time to think. Time to...</p><p align="justify">Anyways, his stubbornness had finally been broken when he could not fight the cold and his empty stomach anymore. He would have been perfectly happy to stay the night on the grounds with the help of a warming charm and after summoning food from the kitchen, had he not left his wand in his room when Ron had dragged him down here.</p><p align="justify">So he had walked back up to the castle, visiting the kitchen for a late dinner amongst Dobby and the other elves, before wandering the empty halls of Hogwarts on his way back. Quite certain that Mrs Norris was hot on his heels, he’d finally made his way back to the seventh floor corridor and to the ship.</p><p align="justify">Even at this hour, he could see the light coming from the workshops and the muffled voices of the late night workers behind their doors. A week ago, he would have reminded them to curb their enthusiasm and to take the time to sleep, but after everything and with his own sleepless nights, he didn’t have the heart to be the hypocrite that would quench their desperation to work on a solution to all their problems.</p><p align="justify">Those thoughts spurred his already foul mood, and fueled his feet as they wandered the corridors to get him as far away from those doors as he could. He quickly recognised the section of the ship where he had ended up, having spent many a sleepless night in this very observation deck watching the stars. </p><p align="justify">Sometimes, Luna would join him there, either to look into the emptiness with him or to paint, always in silence, and at first he thought this would be one of those nights. However, while a girl was indeed on the deck, sitting at the feet of the great window that extended across the ceiling with her knees close to her chest, the short flaming hair and the gold suit gave him no doubt that this night would be different.</p><p align="justify">It had been five days since the funeral.</p><p align="justify">Five days since he last saw her.</p><p align="justify">He doesn’t know how long he stood there, watching her sitting with Neptune and the stars shining brightly behind her, and after an eternity, he gathered up the courage to sit next to her.</p><p align="justify">At first, she did not seem to notice his presence, however her gaze soon tore itself from the view to look at him, almost scared. Dark circles surrounded her eyes and, for a moment, Harry thought back at Ron’s earlier comment, wondering if he was in as bad a state as she seemed to be.</p><p align="justify">Then again, five days. He was probably worse.</p><p align="justify">They sat together, close, but not quite touching, as if afraid the smallest brush would break the other and end the moment.</p><p align="justify">In the end, she proved braver than him.</p><p align="justify">“You were right.”</p><p align="justify">He did not need to ask what she was talking about. The thought had been echoing in his mind for a week now.</p><p align="justify">“We weren’t ready. I shouldn’t have pushed you to do it. It’s just ... It was all so frustrating. Sitting here, safe in our own little paradise while knowing that Mum, Bill and the others were fighting ... This wasn’t why we’d done all of this. But you were right. I should have just listened an-”</p><p align="justify">“No.” It was weird, having the very thoughts that had haunted him for so long being repeated back to him. It should have felt good, to be validated-vindicated, even-in such a way ... yet he could only taste ashes. ”You were right. This needed to be done. I ... I only wished it didn’t come at such a price.”</p><p align="justify">She looked at him, disbelieving.</p><p align="justify">“But we failed, we even lost the files. All because of me.”</p><p align="justify">"And yet we still completed the original mission. And what happened wasn’t your fault." Because if it was anyone’s, it was his, and he would not let her carry this weight. "Your hand was forced."</p><p align="justify">"They found us because I stepped in! If I hadn't-"</p><p align="justify">"If you hadn't, Percy would have been tortured and either killed or sent to Azkaban.” And he might still. They had heard nothing of Percy since the Ministry, and he could have been arrested after they left for all they knew. That wasn’t something Ginny needed to be reminded of right now, though. ”You did the right thing."</p><p align="justify">"For all the good that does us." Ginny buried her head between her knees. "I can't believe Ernie died because I protected <em> Percy </em>." She spat the name, as if saying it burned her tongue. "He's not even family anymore."</p><p align="justify">"Yes he is."</p><p align="justify">She leaned onto his side, not raising her head.</p><p align="justify">"Yes he is ... Despite everything ... He still is ... Is that strange?"</p><p align="justify">“No.” His hand found hers and gently took it into his own. “No, it really isn’t.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">The ticks of the two clocks echoed on the bridge, silent despite being fully staffed, marking the coming of the tenth hour of the sixth day since the Captain had disappeared. The sun burned bright on the horizon as their course took them straight for it.</p><p align="justify">None of the bridge crew was particularly enthusiastic at the idea of testing Requirement’s shields when they had just lost one of their own and the chair behind the main console stood empty. It had been one of the last tasks that Ernie had organised, however, and they felt that, despite everything, they could not deny the last of his work. As such, they carried on, holding their heads high in defiance of the weighty silence and sombre mood as they prepared the ship to withstand the full force of the solar winds.</p><p align="justify">“Get us at the first set of coordinates, Lieutenant.”</p><p align="justify">Ron circled the main console, taking the time to inspect its readings before sitting down, his lanky frame filling the high chair awkwardly.</p><p align="justify">Cho, who was standing next to him at the console, sent him an uncertain look while the rest of the bridge crew exchanged their own.</p><p align="justify">“Are we... Are we not waiting for the Captain?”</p><p align="justify">They had heard of his talk with Harry then. Not really surprising since he had not bothered to be discreet. Being here giving them order already felt weird, so he couldn’t imagine how they felt. He did not like that it gave them a hope he would have to crush, however...</p><p align="justify">“Harry’s not coming. I’ll supervise the test today.”</p><p align="justify">Cho’s hesitant eyes did not leave his own, searching for something. Reassurance? Hope, maybe? She would have a hard time finding any. There was precious few of it to find in him these days. With a small nod and a pointed look, Ron turned her attention back to the console, where she moved and turned the command stone without a word to adjust their course.</p><p align="justify">“Once we reach the first position, I want a detailed report on the shields before we move to the next-”</p><p align="justify">The all too familiar hissing sound of a door opening was soft enough that it was often missed, but in this instant, it seemed as deafening as thunder.</p><p align="justify">Every head turned to see Harry step onto the bridge and stop, their eyes darting between him and Ron as they waited for one to move with bated breath.</p><p align="justify">The two of them stood still as they looked at each other for a few short moments, until Ron, failing to repress his smile despite his best efforts, stood up and stepped away from the chair.</p><p align="justify">“Captain on the bridge.”</p><p align="justify">A small, grateful smile tugged at Harry’s lips as he stepped forward, taking back his chair while Ron stood by his side.</p><p align="justify">“Proceed as planned, Lieutenant.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">A scruffy-looking Reginald Swansforth stood in front of a peculiar shop in Diagon Alley. The streets were a far cry from their former glory, all warmth and life gone with the many disappeared denizens and the now boarded-up shops. The few passersby did their utmost to get to their business quickly, looking everywhere but at the abandoned storefronts and loitering homeless huddled together for warmth.</p><p align="justify">It was in search of that same warmth that Reginald tightened the too-small cloak around his lanky frame with hands that refused to stop trembling. Repeated exposure to the Cruciatus would do that to you. Had his wand not been snapped, he would have been able to keep the cold away without second-hand clothes he had picked up in a trash bin, but this luxury wasn’t one shared by undeserving citizens these days.</p><p align="justify">His eyes darted to the letter he held, checking the hour and address written on it for what seemed like the hundredth time. It had appeared out of thin air in front of him, in the alley where he had taken to sleeping these last couple days, snatchers having raided the abandoned house he and a dozen others had claimed for themselves. The loopy handwriting on it promised him food and shelter at no charge, and while it seemed far too good an offer to be true, he knew he wouldn’t last much longer on his own out here.</p><p align="justify">So it was with a grim face that Reginald knocked on the door displaying the word “closed” in glowing letters surrounded by glittering stars. He did not have to wait long, as a middle-aged woman opened the door with a large smile only a few moments later. She seemed to know exactly who he was and what he was here for, inviting him to come in and to leave his coat on the rack before ushering him deeper into the shop.</p><p align="justify">The shop had been decorated garishly, as if an over-excited teenager had made an attempt at it and decided to cram as many space-themed items in the relatively small room. However, he could not deny that the sight of the model of the planets circling just under the star-dotted ceiling lightly tugged at his heart. </p><p align="justify">Since he’d graduated and joined St Mungo's apprenticeship program, he never had the time to really indulge in his love of astronomy. And with all that happened, he doubted he would ever have the opportunity again.</p><p align="justify">He was brought to an office in the back, a blond girl that the woman had called Abbott sat at a desk, writing loopy letters on a parchment. Reginald’s eyes, however, were wide open in shock and fixed on the boy with a wide grin standing next to her. He had not seen or heard of him in two weeks, and here he was, looking like the perfect picture of health if one excluded the thick scars on his hand.</p><p align="justify">"Good to see you, Swansforth. Tell me, would you like a job?"</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Despite what Harry’s schedule these last few months could suggest, working in the dead of night was not exactly encouraged aboard Neptune Station. He even had to work with Hannah to establish strict resting hours to force the engineers to leave their labs and get some rest a couple weeks after its inauguration. Swansforth’s arrival, however, had come at a time where their need for medical expertise was greater than ever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dean and Susan had performed admirably with what little training they had, taking care of every burns, cuts and other injuries sustained by the crew during training and lab accidents, but they had reached their limits. With the D.S.F. now fully engaged in the war, they now had to deal with severe injuries and curses on a daily basis, and it was fortunate that they had not lost anyone else before they had found Swansforth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After recuperating from the Ministry’s debacle, Harry had wasted no time before sending the combat team and any trained officer back to Britain. With their technology and the element of surprise, their first strikes on snatchers cells and suspected Death Eaters hideout had gone without a hitch. Far too soon for their taste, however, the Aurors had adapted and passed around the detection spell that had proved effective in the Ministry and to which they had yet to find a countermeasure. They came close to disaster a few times, and their raids now had to be more carefully planned, but it did not stop them from getting out there and fight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had already waited far too long because of him, and they would not back down until Voldemort and his ilk were wiped out of the face of the Earth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Which is why, in spite of the late hours back in Britain, the infirmary of the station remained brightly lit and its newly appointed Chief Healer was hard at work rearranging his new domain when Harry stepped in. Most of the research and analysis equipment had been moved to adjacent rooms, leaving the largest almost empty for now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see you’ve redecorated.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good evening, Captain Potter. You really needed more space for beds and diagnostics.” As Harry leaned stiffly against one of the few remaining counters, Swansforth put down the alien device he was inspecting. “I’ll have a talk with Miss Brown and make a trip to Toke Trail tomorrow, but we should have this place up and running again by Tuesday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know you can just call me Harry, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Up until now, it had only been the crew that called him that, and with Fred and George being the oldest ... It felt weird to have someone more than ten years his senior call him “captain”. Or, Merlin forbid, “admiral”...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright. What can I do for you, Harry?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wanted to check on Neville and Luna.” The two of them had been injured the day before while extracting a muggle-born family from a snatcher raid. “I haven’t had the time to see them yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid you missed them. Since they were on the mend, I sent them back to their quarters this afternoon so they can rest while we move things around here.” Swansforth sent him a knowing look. “They’ll be fine. Logbottom was a bit banged up, but they should be fully recovered by next week.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good.” Harry could feel some of the tension leave him at his words. He knew he couldn’t keep them hidden until the end of the war, but it did not make the idea of sending his friends to fight without him easier to bear. “I’ll see them tomorrow then. In the meantime, I have a few things that I wanted to talk to you about. Are you settling in well?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s been ... an experience. Don’t get me wrong, Susan and Dean have been a great help and I’m thankful for the opportunity, but I’m still trying to wrap my head around...” Swansforth looked around, gesturing at the room. “All of this. And I’ve already treated more severe curses and injuries in my short time here than in my years at St Mungo’s. You kids sure know how to keep a healer busy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’m happy you like it because we’re in it for the long run.” Tapping on his data-slate, Harry brought up a full page of runes on the screen. ”Have you brushed up on your runes yet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A bit. Ancient languages aren’t really my forte.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You might want to pick up the pace and check with Commander Johnson if you need any help then. I’ll need you to start combing the ship’s database as soon as possible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Swansforth took the slate offered by Harry, his brow furrowing as he tried to make sense of the symbols on it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Searching for something in particular?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Three things. Though you should catalogue any medical information you come across.” Harry gave a tap to the slate in Swansforth’s trembling hand, bringing up another page of runes. “First, you’ll have to find anything that can help victims of the Cruciatus curse.” Harry looked at the healer knowingly.  “We’re facing it far too often for my taste these days”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Swansforth’s mouth tightened into a thin line, the trembling of his hands abating slightly as he strained his grasp on the slate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“After that, I want you to look for cures that could help against withering curses or high doses of magical venoms that prevent wounds from closing. Considering you’ll need to train Dean and Susan in addition to your regular duties, this should keep you busy for a while.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s...” Swansforth took a deep breath, attempting to calm his hands. “That’s quite outside my area of expertise. Though I guess there isn’t exactly an expert in any of this alien stuff.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, there isn’t. But that’s why we’re here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Still, I know things are tense with the Ministry and You-Know-Who, but what are you kids doing that need this kind of stuff as a priority?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing special, really.” Harry shrugged. “It’s pretty standard fare around here. You’ll get used to it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“While we still don’t know what killed the crew and stranded the ship, we found something I thought might interest you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Parchments covered with runic translations carpeted the walls and tables, and one had to sidestep the towers of reference books if they wanted to get to the large console on the far wall. The latter was unlike any other wall in the ship, however, as instead of a smooth metal surface, clear cylindrical crystals were arrayed inside of it, protected by a force field similar to the other “windows” in the ship. In its centre was a large rounded screen, currently displaying a representation of the Milky Way where a silver line followed three of its outermost arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s ... Impressive?” Harry offered tactfully. “But we already had a map of the galaxy, so what am I looking at?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re looking at Requirement’s flight log.” Zacharias supplied. “This line is the path she took while exploring the galaxy to scan planets and space anomalies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As far as we can tell, that’s what most of the database is about.” Michael said through a mouthful of muffin, the tray Harry had brought with him set on a pile of books before him, noticeably emptier than it had been a minute ago. “Number of planets in a star system, detailed analysis of the star, geological records ... All the good stuff. This ship was either a scout or a science vessel, designed to explore and study planets.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So we already know what’s out there, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Somewhat,” Angelina replied, snatching one of the last muffins before it could disappear like its brothers. “Assuming things didn’t change much in the last six thousand years, we estimate that we have data on half of the Outer, Perseus and Orion arms, including the parts the Muggles haven’t discovered yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>While Muggles had made tremendous progress in the past decades, Wizards and Wizards had spent thousands of years observing the stars with the help of magic to study their effects on potions and rituals. They had mapped the galaxy centuries ago, including the detached part of the Outer arm which had for now eluded the Muggle astronomers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The arms ... right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Earth is roughly in the middle of the Orion arm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The records are massive, and we’ve barely begun to scratch the surface. There’s something weird, though.” Angelina scowled at the map, as if its very existence was a personal insult. “The ship has visited hundreds of thousands of star systems and found thousands of planets capable of supporting life as we know it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m guessing we’re not talking about humans and cats.“</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“More like liquid water and carbon-based organisms. Mostly plants. Like this one.” Padma swept her fingers on her data slate in the direction of the screen, bringing up the rotating picture of a planet and far too many runes. “I’ve gone through a few of these already, and they all present roughly earth-like conditions. Another thing they have in common is this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a few more taps on her slate, the runic text disappeared, only to be replaced by six new symbols that Harry had never seen before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Every one of these planets is identified by a unique combination of these runes. We haven’t been able to translate them yet, but I would guess that it’s a naming system of sorts.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright. Make a list of the closest planets and send it to Cho. It’s as good a place as any to start exploring once Hermione and her team are done.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know you want to investigate this, Padma, but that’s not the point.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what is it?” Harry frowned. “We have a destination now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s too many of them.” Angelina manipulated her own slate, bringing up the map of the galaxy again, but this time a small portion of it was covered by thousands of small dots. “The conditions for a planet to be able to support life as we know it are extremely precise and even the smallest deviation could condemn it to remain a barren wasteland. In a galaxy as big as the Milky Way, there shouldn’t be this many of them. And we’re only talking about a small part of it, so chances are that there are even more out there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are too many needles in the haystack.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, probabilities or not, these planets are there.” Harry shrugged. “Maybe we just didn’t know enough about the galaxy to know that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not possible. Everything astrophysicists have been able to deduce was based on the observations of the stars from Earth. See, stars are so far apart from each other that given the speed of light, it’s like looking back in time to how they were thousands or tens of thousands of years ago. Now, that may seem long for us, but on a geological scale-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Urgh, you’re taking forever.” Zacharias whined, earning himself a disapproving look from his Commander. “In short, barren planets the muggles found became life-bearing in a few thousand years and they’re not supposed to change that fast, or at all. So either astrophysicists have been wrong on everything this past century, or something—someone—has been going around, transforming planets and seeding life across the galaxy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That ... was quite the theory.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Our aliens, maybe? The ones that built Requirement? With this level of technology, it wouldn’t surprise me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe. They could also have come to the same conclusion we did and dispatched the ship to investigate. We haven’t found anything resembling a mission statement yet, so for now, it’s anyone’s guess. What we did find, however...” Angelina turned the stone on the console, changing the map of the galaxy displayed on the screen for a larger one. “Is this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You ... found the zoom feature?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not quite.” She said with a dry smile. “This is another one entirely. And judging by what we could make of it, the one the aliens came from.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bugger. As if they didn’t have their hands full with the one planet already.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rays of the sun had come out of hiding that Saturday, melting the snow and warming the halls while the students enjoyed some well-deserved rest after a busy week. While news of the world outside the castle was sparse and grim, homework and friends remained a steady and comforting constant in their lives, allowing most of them to take their minds off it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>While a great many of them had taken the opportunity to enjoy the luxury of staying in bed for an extra hour, the early risers were already leaving the great hall, anxious to make the most of their day. Amongst the latter was a small group of Hufflepuffs who had seemingly decided to take the scenic route as they made their way up to the upper floors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A group of friends laughing as they roamed the halls would have been a perfectly normal occurrence, if not for a single fact. At a glance, one could assume it would be because of their disastrous fashion sense, as every one of them wore colourful form-fitting suits under their robes, but that was not the case. While odd, others in the upper years had been taken in by this disastrous fashion for a year now, and they had long since stopped attracting questioning looks and snickers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, what truly stood out about them was not the group itself, but the dozen Slytherins from all ages following them around as discreetly as a troupe of Erumpents in a wand shop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite their complete lack of subtlety as they rushed from one corner to the next, they had somehow managed to tail the three unsuspecting teenagers, unseen by all but a few passersby and portraits. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their ungraceful procession almost came to an end, however, when a second-year tripped on his too-large robes as they climbed the stairs to the seventh floor. His freckled face would have made the unfortunate acquaintance with the polished steps, if not for the massive hand of Gregory Goyle catching a fistful of his robes and pulling him back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Watch your damned steps, Dixon.” Hissed Daphne Greengrass a few steps ahead of them before turning her attention back to the leader of their troop. “I hate you, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, you don’t.” Tracey Davis sing-songed, an easy smile on her lips as she confidently walked around the nearest corner. “Now come on, they’re getting away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a groan, Daphne trailed after her, sending a look above her shoulder to make sure the others were still following.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>”This would already be bad enough if it was just us. Why did we have to bring the little tykes?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oy!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up, Mallow. I know you still sleep with a Hippogriff plush.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fifth year's dark cheeks flushed and she looked away, a retort dying at the tip of her tongue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because we need them.” Tracey giggled softly. “And don’t be so harsh on them. I still remember someone not being able to sleep because they misplaced their favourite blanket just last month.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I ... you ... shut up! And what are we even doing, anyway?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll see. We’re almost there, I think.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They turned another corner, only to discover a corridor without any obnoxiously happy Hufflepuff in sight, and a quick look beyond the intersection at the other end gave them no more signs of their passage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And now they’re gone. Great.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I’m sure they came through here. They can’t have gone far.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just admit that we failed. Again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What small amount of patience Daphne usually reserved for her friend’s “brilliant” ideas had dried up three floors ago already, and as she looked around the deserted corridor, Daphne felt the last shred of friendly obligations that had pushed her to humour this farce disappear. Were they not in the presence of so many of their classmates, she would have had quite a few words of choice for Tracey before storming back to the common room to salvage what little remained of the morning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>”This has been a colossal waste of all of our time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the corner of her eye, she could see Millicent frowning, whether at her or Tracey, she did not know, and Greg towering over the half-asleep housemates gathering around him, impassive as always. Sure, they had all worked together these last few months, be it by eavesdropping in the corridors or by unsuccessfully tailing the walking insults to fashion like those they had just lost, but nothing as over as this before. Most of them, including herself, would have continued to enjoy their blissful sleep if not for an unusually cheerful and confident Tracry dragging them all out of bed to go gallivanting around the castle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s here. I’m sure of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look around!” Daphne gestured widely at the empty corridor, exasperated. “There’s nothing here. That’s not going to change because ‘you’re sure of it’!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aaaaahw, little sneaky snakes are having a fight?” A juvenile voice echoed from one of the suits of armour lined up against the wall. “Without inviting me?” The metal glove of the suit came to rest against its heart. “I’m hurt!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some of the younger years stepped away from the armour as Greg pulled out his wand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leave us alone Peeves, or I’ll tell the Baron you’ve been going near the grey Lady again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No! Haven’t-wouldn’t-couldn’t do that.” The visor of the armour’s helm fell with a clank, giving it a menacing look as it stepped off its pedestal to point at her. “And you better not tell tall tales if you don’t want to find out what happens, to snitches out of the pitch!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then get lost, you little—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With the sound of the poltergeist blowing a raspberry, the suit of armour fell to the floor like a marionette whose strings had been cut and broke apart in a clatter of stone and metal. Peeves flew above their heads, throwing dungbombs at them before disappearing around the corner, laughing like a maniac all the way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Trying to avoid the smelly parting gifts, the younger members of their group attempted to flee, but only managed to run into each other and fall to the floor in a mess of tangled robes and limbs, bringing down the others and a tapestry with them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seemingly unperturbed, Tracey stood amidst the chaos, her eyes following the feathered helm of the armour, fascinated by the way it rolled on the polished floor and passed right through the wall in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jackpot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her discovery fell on deaf ears, however, as the others were still trying to untangle themselves</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Swearing as she pushed someone off her, Daphne took the hand Gregory offered her and pushed herself back up. She offered her thanks and he simply nodded before moving on to the next person.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Such a lack of manners would normally earn a few spiteful comments from her, but her lips stayed tightly closed. While he had never been the most cheerful or chivalrous boy, the last few months had been hard on him and he deserved the right to be a little curt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still, this whole affair was more than a little miffed, and she might have been</span>
  <em>
    <span> slightly </span>
  </em>
  <span>too forceful when she pulled up a third year by the shoulders. The swear-filled tirade that Daphne was about to begin, urging the others to pick themselves up, died in a yelp of surprise when Tracey’s top half came out of the wall in front of them, that annoying grin larger than ever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This way guys! Felix found it!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not wasting a second, Greg was the first to gather himself and step right through the wall, as if it wasn’t there. The assembled students exchanged doubtful looks, hesitating for a moment before following suit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Left alone in the now deserted hallway, Daphne humphed a last time in annoyance, charming off the smell and muttering to herself before she walked through the wall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is the last time I’m letting her drink that stuff.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Among the many communal spaces that had been set up on the station, one in particular saw very little use. The kitchen, despite being fully equipped with the latest in muggle and magical appliances, rarely housed visitors. Why bother cooking when you could have a full-course meal served just right at the push of a button after all?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The answer, for Harry at least, was because he wanted to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had picked up the habit of coming down here twice a week to try his hand at baking a variety of sweets, muggles and magicals alike. Cooking had been the one chore he wasn't allowed to do at the Dursleys. It would have given him access to their hard-earned food and we couldn't have that now, could we? However, now that he was free of their home and wouldn’t put one foot back there again if he had any say in it, he did not have to care about their rules.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could cook.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And more importantly, he could bake. He could prepare anything and everything he'd ever wanted to try. All the cakes and sweets Dudley had gleefully gorged himself with while he had to watch with a grumbling stomach... Well, not anymore. Hermione had even gifted him a book of magical recipes at Christmas after he'd mentioned his new interest to Ron and her one night in the ship’s lounge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Most weeks, unfortunately, more pressing matters emerged and changed his plans at the last minute, depriving him of these simple moments when he could forget about the war and just try to make something for himself for once.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Today was a special day, however, and he had made it clear that he did not wish to be disturbed under any circumstances.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taking great care to keep his hands high above the plate, Harry sprinkled a mix of spices on what was quickly becoming his most terrifying and regretted creation yet. The idea had sounded great at first, Hagrid was sure to love the theme and look of the dragon-bite tart after all, and it would hopefully lift his spirit after Aragog's death and Grawp's unwillingness to learn not to try to eat people. However, after two hours of delicate measuring and thoroughly bitten fingers, he just wasn't so sure the pain was worth it anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still, he had gone too far to stop now, so he held up his wand by the tip of his bandaged fingers and sent the tart back to the oven with a flick, cursing the one who had decided to omit warnings in the cookbook.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With the oven programmed for the final baking, it was time to move on to the thankfully normal custard. Taking out the milk, cream and eggs, Harry wondered if he shouldn’t add some gelatin to thicken it. Maybe once it had drowned in it, the tart would be less inclined to bite the hand off anyone who dared try to eat it. Then again, maybe Hagrid would prefer—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain? We have a situation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merlin’s saggy bollocks.</span>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="justify">Bridget Mallow was a rational girl.</p><p align="justify">She did not believe in divination, astrology, arithmancy or any other mumbo-jumbo meant to trick the simple-minded. Her days were strictly organised and she planned everything in advance, leaving nothing to chance if she could avoid it. Her education, her post-graduation apprenticeship, her future employment at her uncle’s workshop ... every part of her life and future had been clearly defined and prepared for a long time and she worked every day to make it a reality.</p><p align="justify">Life, however, did not care one bit for anyone’s desires.</p><p align="justify">She could still picture the exact moment her carefully crafted dreams had crumbled all around her, on the evening of the first of November. Her fifth year had begun much as the previous one, with only the Headmaster’s and Potter’s delusions to break the monotony of life in the castle instead of a deadly tournament or a mass murderer prowling the grounds.</p><p align="justify">She had just come out of a transfiguration exam where she had expertly vanished a single coloured thread from a spool of yarn, earning herself an Outstanding as usual, when a special edition of the Daily Prophet had arrived. While she had known of Malfoy’s dad becoming the Minister the previous day, she did not expect it to affect her beyond having to tolerate his preening in the common room for a few weeks.</p><p align="justify">How wrong she had been.</p><p align="justify">The Prophet’s announcement of these new “taxes” had broken through her dreams and certainty. While she was a half-blood, her mother and uncle were muggle-borns, and their family was nowhere near wealthy enough to afford these new fees to keep the shop open. And as if the floor beneath her feet was falling apart one stone at a time, this had only been the beginning, with each week bringing its share of devastating new policies while her housemates rejoiced all around her.</p><p align="justify">With her future broken and her spirit ground to dust with each new edition of the Prophet, she began to lose herself. Sleep eluded her, her schoolwork was neglected and she grew even more isolated from her peers. She must have looked like a ghost, merely going through the motions of life, waiting for the final blow to come. It was no wonder Tracey had seemed so sure of herself when she had approached her to let her in on her “Potter plan”.</p><p align="justify">Which was still a stupid name, no matter what she said.</p><p align="justify">The group had the equally stupid goal of spying on Potter, well-known prick with delusions of grandeur and suspected murderer of Cedric Diggory, to gain some leverage and bargain for his protection. Because yes, they apparently needed protection. As if the Ministry going mad wasn’t bad enough, Goyle had managed to convince Davis and Greengrass that Potter was actually sane and that the Dark Lord was responsible for everything happening lately.</p><p align="justify">Why was this her life now?</p><p align="justify">What had she done to deserve this?</p><p align="justify">And yet ... knowing that she was not alone, that others not only faced the same grim outlooks as she did, but chose to rise against it? That she had friends who would lend an ear to her woes and worries and understand?</p><p align="justify">It helped. It helped her so much.</p><p align="justify">Slowly, he picked the pieces of herself off the ground and tried to build a new life for herself. One that now included this shoddy band of outliers in their house. They met in dusty classrooms and supply closets deep in the dungeons, whispering and plotting how to approach the elusive Gryffindor far from wandering ears. Since before she even joined, they had tailed Potter and his friends, eavesdropping on their conversation and attempting to probe him as subtly as possible. Unfortunately for them, the boy was as dense as a brick.</p><p align="justify">The absolute worst scheme they had come up with had even cost Bridget a hard-won date during one of Slughorn’s parties. Nylah was still not talking to her after she had abandoned her to cling to Potter all night.</p><p align="justify">And she hadn’t even learned anything!</p><p align="justify">Months of tracking and spying and they were not any closer to knowing whatever Potter was hiding, though the timing of the recent disappearance of a Hufflepuff from his group and an attack on the Ministry did give them some ideas...</p><p align="justify">And now, a drugged-up Tracey was herding them through the entire castle and through a fake wall in what was bound to be another fool’s errand.</p><p align="justify">If this was just another secret passage to the third-floor toilets, she was burning Tracey’s trunk.</p><hr /><p align="justify">Humming a song to herself and wearing the feathered helm of a suit of armour, Tracey let her feet guide her through the hidden corridor. Everything had gone just right this morning. From Draco’s little accident with a third-year potion experience in the common room, making sure he would not notice them sneaking about, to Finch-Fletchley and his friends unknowingly leading them to their secret hideout.</p><p align="justify">Today was a good day.</p><p align="justify">She finally stopped in front of a large oval-shaped door in front of a hilarious tapestry of a wizard chased by Trolls in tutus. She had never seen a door such as this, and definitely not in Hogwarts. Its polished metal surface looked more like nacre than the steel of her helm and clashed horrendously with the stone wall and the medieval decor.</p><p align="justify">“Isn’t that....” Millicent was staring at the tapestry, where the wizard was climbing up a tree and uselessly flailing his wand toward the Trolls. Behind her, the others were arriving, with a very moody Daphne closing the march. “But I thought this hallway had disappeared...”</p><p align="justify">Though the important locations like the great hall usually remained in the same place, the castle had always been whimsical with its halls and rooms. Some appeared and disappeared at random while others were only present on certain days of the week or if the weather allowed it. One week the corridor on the right-hand side of the history classroom would lead to the defence tower and the next it would end at the feet of the astronomy tower. With time, the students learned to navigate the changing halls, but every new term brought its share of surprises.</p><p align="justify">Tracey was half-convinced Dumbledore was the one doing it, most likely to mess with McGonagall.</p><p align="justify">“This is it, people. The end of the road.” She could almost feel that what they were looking for was right behind this door, Felix singing in her veins as she brought down the visor of a helm she knew she would need. “Forward!”</p><p align="justify">As if reacting to her approach, the door split in two, the halves sliding into the frames, revealing a well-lit room made entirely of the same smooth metal and filled with crates and furniture. She could hear the others hesitating, whispering among themselves before they finally followed her, leaving behind the warm and welcoming halls of Hogwarts for this strange unknown.</p><p align="justify">“So we found a storage room. Wonderful.” Despite the sarcasm, Daphne’s voice lacked its usual certainty and one might even hear a hint of worry underneath the defeatism. ”And with our luck, it’s probably just a stash of dungbombs or whatever.”</p><p align="justify">Undeterred, Tracey led the way to the door across the room, only to stop in her tracks once she stepped into the corridor beyond. As the others walked around her, they stopped in turn, bemused as she was by the impossible sight beyond a window so transparent it might as well not exist.</p><p align="justify">Tracey took off her helm, now a useless prop that blocked her view of what she had only seen through a telescope, dropping it to the ground with a clang that brought a few others out of their trance flinching.</p><p align="justify">“This ... this can’t be...”</p><p align="justify">“What in Slytherin’s—”</p><p align="justify">A retching sound interrupted Daphne before she could corrupt the impressionable minds among them, bringing the rest of them back to their senses.</p><p align="justify">“Oh right. Dixon and wide spaces.” Tearing her gaze from the impossible spectacle, Tracey turned to see one of the second year emptying his breakfast in the upturned helm she had abandoned. “So that’s why I need that.” As the others stepped away, disgust clear on their faces, Tracey came to pat his back reassuringly. “It’s alright. Take your time.”</p><p align="justify">“How the hell did you get in here?”</p><p align="justify">As one, everyone in their group, with the notable exception of Dixon, turned to see an aghast Anthony Goldstein, dressed in that strange bronze single-piece bodysuit with what looked like blue armour parts. For a few seconds, everyone around her remained frozen like deers caught in the headlights, the silence only disturbed by Dixon’s further efforts to rid himself of last night’s dinner.</p><p align="justify">“We’re a bit busy here, Goldstein. We’ll be with you in a minute.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">Gregory Goyle was sitting on one side of a large oblong table in a sparsely decorated room. Wooden furniture clashed with the metal of the walls and a couple of potted plants sat in the corners, failing to bring some sort of life to a room that did not seem to see many visitors. Not far, Tracey and Daphne were looking through a window that stretched through the length of one of the walls, giving them a view of the other arm of the massive metal structure they had found themselves in.</p><p align="justify">“No one can need that many windows.” Daphne crossed her arms, her severe expression betrayed by the nervous looks she sent to their hosts every few seconds. “They barely even bring any light to the rooms!”</p><p align="justify">“Oh come on Daph.” Tracey, for her part, looked like a child who had just gained a lifetime supply of Honeydukes’ finest. “I’d also put windows everywhere if I had a view like that.”</p><p align="justify">The sound of someone clearing their throat brought back their attention toward the doorway, where none other than Potter—flanked by Weasley and Abbot— looked none too impressed.</p><p align="justify">“I hope you realise you’ve put us in quite a complicated situation.“</p><p align="justify">Nonplussed, Gregory simply shrugged while everyone else took their seats. They would have almost looked like a regular study group if not for the two red and gold figures in full armour on either side of the only door, their features hidden by smooth metal helmets. Those two had brought them here, wand in hand, and had not said one word since, seemingly content to watch over them as long as they didn’t get too close to the exit.</p><p align="justify">”Says the one who had us locked up like criminals.”</p><p align="justify">“I think we’ve been more than accommodating given the circumstances. From what I’ve been told, you and your friends somehow bypassed our security measures and trespassed onto the station uninvited.”</p><p align="justify">“Please. If you didn’t want people walking in here, you shouldn’t have left a door in the middle of the castle.”</p><p align="justify">“That door,” Weasley frowned, leaning forward. “was hidden in an invisible corridor, layered with twenty-seven different charms meant to deter any intrusion and warn us in the eventuality of a breach. And somehow, you managed to waltz through all of that and just walk in here like you were invited. I want to know how.”</p><p align="justify">“Simple. We followed Finch-Fletchley and his friends.”</p><p align="justify">“Trace!”</p><p align="justify">“What? It’s true.”</p><p align="justify">“I see.” Faced with Tacey’s beaming smile, it was Potter’s turn to frown. He sent a stern look to Abbot who kept tapping on a weird flat rectangle made of the same weird metal as the walls but with some incrustations that looked more like polished ivory. “I assume you had a good reason to do so?”</p><p align="justify">“Well, you and your friends haven’t exactly been subtle this past year. Going around the castle with your bodysuits, leaving your dorms, disappearing from the castle sometime for days at a time.”</p><p align="justify">“And you wanted to know where we went?”</p><p align="justify">“Not exactly.” If looks could curse, the one Daphne was giving Tracey would have sent her for a year-long stay at St Mungo’s. It did nothing to dampen Tracey’s enthusiasm, however. “See, we’ve spent a while trying to find out what you’ve been doing. We had some ideas, of course, but no actual proof. Some of the stuff we heard from our families or in the hallways—”</p><p align="justify">“So you were spying on us?”</p><p align="justify">“No! Well, okay, we were, but that’s not—”</p><p align="justify">“You are fighting the Dark Lord.”</p><p align="justify">Gregory’s statement cut Tracey’s rambling short and brought all the attention toward him. Unconcerned by the stares, his own remained locked with Potter’s, unyielding.</p><p align="justify">“And what if we are?”</p><p align="justify">“Then I want in.”</p><p align="justify">This did not seem to be what they had been expecting. While Daphne’s face disappeared in her hands as she mourned the death of subtlety, surprise and confusion replaced anger and suspicion on the other side of the table. Even the two guards broke their statue routine and looked at each other in what one could have called shock if their expressions had been visible.</p><p align="justify">“That’s ... unexpected.” Potter pulled himself together, sitting up straight. “But since I know for a fact that your father is a Death Eater, I’m not sure we can take your word for it. Especially since we have never been on the best of terms.”</p><p align="justify">“I have a brother. He’s a painter, making portraits and everything. He’s always been the smart one, studying and making things. He didn’t want to do it, but Father forced him to take the Mark. When he failed a mission, he was tortured so bad he lost his arm.” His voice cracked as the memories played once more in his mind.  “He can’t paint anymore.” Gregory took a few shallow breaths before composing himself, taking comfort in the hand Daphne had placed on his shoulder. “That’s not how Father and Draco said things were going to be. I don’t want to serve a monster.”</p><p align="justify">No one seemed to want to break the silence. Daphne was scowling at them, silently warning of the consequences for anyone foolish enough to try to laugh at him and even Tracey had lost some of her exuberance.</p><p align="justify">Potter didn’t laugh though. Nor did his cronies. He simply watched Greg for a while before looking at her and Trace.</p><p align="justify">“I see ... And you?”</p><p align="justify">“Some of us are in similar situations. Mostly, we just want an out from this whole thing. Some of the stuff they’re doing out there might have sounded nice on paper, but ... it’s terrifying. I don’t want to be a part of that when I graduate. And at the rate things are going, we’re not going to be given a choice.”</p><p align="justify">“There’s still one thing I don’t understand.” Weasley seemed to have calmed down. At least he had stopped looking at them like they were particularly offending insects that had found their way onto his plate. “Why did you seek us out? You had no way of knowing what we were doing. Dumbledore’s the one organising the resistance and his office isn’t that hard to find.”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t flatter yourself, Weasley.” Daphne scoffed. “Like I said, you haven’t exactly been as subtle as you seem to think. The disappearances? The way you lot strutted around when Umbridge left? McMillan and your injuries when the entire Floo network went down?”</p><p align="justify">“Dumbledore trusts Snape.” Gregory shook his head. “And Snape is the Dark Lord’s spy. If we went to him, the Dark Lord would know and kill our families.”</p><p align="justify">“Though we didn’t expect whatever all of this is.” Tracey peeked up, regaining some of her previous energy. “Could we talk about that by the way? Because I have questions!”</p><p align="justify">“We’ll get to that. Maybe. But if you know about Ernie, you understand that what we’re doing isn’t without risk.”</p><p align="justify">“What isn’t these days? That’s why we need your help. Some of us can fight, but most of these kids?” For the first time since she had stepped on the station, Tracey was not smiling. All traces of excitement and wonder had disappeared, leaving a cold determination in their place. “They need a safe place to stay. There’s no way I’m sending them back to their parents once summer comes around.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">“We can’t let them go.”</p><p align="justify">Having left their ''guests'' behind, Harry had retreated to a nearby lab with Ron, Hannah and Zacharias. With a breach of security this important, he would have preferred to have all of his Commanders here. Unfortunately, most of the crew was currently onboard Requirement on the other side of the system for a training flight, leaving him with only two of them and Angelina’s second. This had become a problem far sooner than anticipated. As soon as they were back, he would have Terry look into long-range communications.</p><p align="justify">“We can’t exactly keep them locked up either, Ron.” Harry was pacing around the room, anxious to do something instead of just standing around while his worst fears were coming to life two rooms down. “Their absence might have already been noticed.”</p><p align="justify">“So what, we make them promise to stay quiet and release them into the castle? We’ll have Death Eaters at the door by dinner.”</p><p align="justify">“Not all Slytherins are supporters of You-Know-Who.” Hannah protested. “Tracey’s my friend, she would never betray us like that.”</p><p align="justify">“Fat lot of good that does us when we have a dozen more down the hall. You can vouch for them too?”</p><p align="justify">“What’s your problem, Weasley?” Zacharias stepped in, cutting Hannah’s rebuttal. “They wear green and suddenly they’re the enemy?”</p><p align="justify">“My problem, Smith, is the security of this station and everyone on it. My job.”</p><p align="justify">“Ooooh, your job. How noble of you to be wary of twelve years olds. For Helga’s sake, Weasley...”</p><p align="justify">Uncrossing his arms, Ron walked up to Zacharias, towering over him as he stood his ground under his glare.</p><p align="justify">“They all but confessed that their parents are Death Eaters, and we all know what’s going on in their house these days. If we trust them, it’s only a matter of time until they let something slip, even by accident, and we’ll have the entire Auror force banging down your little lab.”</p><p align="justify">“You sure talk big about people’s families when your own brother has his nose up the Minister’s arse.”</p><p align="justify">“That’s enough!”</p><p align="justify">At Harry’s shout, Ron’s fist stopped inches from Zacharias’ face. With a scornful glare, he walked away, sitting down heavily on the far side of the room. Hannah slapped Zacharias in the arm and gave him a warning look before he leaned on the table next to her, his own glare never leaving Ron.</p><p align="justify">“We’ll talk about this later.” Harry sternly looked at the two of them. “For now, you’re both right. I don’t think they represent a danger for us by themselves, but we can’t just let them go.”</p><p align="justify">“Maybe we could obliviate them?” Hannah proposed. “That way we’d be sure they wouldn’t tell anyone.”</p><p align="justify">“No.” Harry shook his head at Justin. “None of us really knows the charm and I’ve seen what even a successful one does to someone. We’re not inflicting that on anyone. Besides, they asked for our help.”</p><p align="justify">“So what? They’re not the only ones in need. We have safe houses full of families everywhere in the country. We could find a place where they could lay low.”</p><p align="justify">“Maybe ... But I think I have a better idea. Hannah, you still have a few contracts lying around, right?”</p><hr /><p align="justify">“—and for reasons we haven’t been able to figure out yet, they ran out of power while exploring our solar system thousands of years ago. Life support eventually failed and killed the whole crew, leaving the ship adrift until we discovered it and replaced the power source.“</p><p align="justify">“So we’re aboard a giant metal box floating in space and it’s already killed its entire crew once. Charming.”</p><p align="justify">As far as learning went, following Michael Corner as he droned on about the ship barely rated above Binns’ lectures. Leave it to him to make the explanation of the madness Daphne and the others had stumbled upon as dry as McGonnagal’s knickers. Still, despite his dreadful lack of enthusiasm, he had at least been thorough in this little tour of his.</p><p align="justify">And what a tour it had been.</p><p align="justify">Beings from other planets? Technology thousands of years old and yet more advanced than she’d ever understand? How they had built this entire station out of nothing? The fact that <em> Potter </em>of all people was in charge of it all?</p><p align="justify">It boggles the mind to think that they had been hiding all of that from everyone. Worse yet, now they had to do it too!</p><p align="justify">While Trace and Greg had jumped at the opportunity, they had all but strong-armed her into signing these damn magical contracts. They were now bound to stay silent and could not reveal anything about this madness to anyone on Earth until such time that the Dark Lord was no longer a threat. Fat chances of that. </p><p align="justify">However, if this ship was as functional as they claimed, maybe they didn’t need to return at all...</p><p align="justify">She could all too easily think of worse fates than sailing across the stars while the idiotic adults on Earth got their crap together.</p><p align="justify">For all her reservations, she couldn’t deny that all this alien stuff was big. Like, world changing big. They would have been foolish to deny the invitation. And it’s not like she was that opposed to the idea in the first place. She just had some trouble wrapping her head around it. The cold shoulders and suspicious stares from everyone on board didn’t exactly help either. Though she’d take that every day of the week as long as she didn’t have to deal with Loony Lovegood anymore.</p><p align="justify">“It really is. It’s a bit big, though and we only use a small part of it. The station is even bigger since it needs to store what it mines from the planet. Oh, and try to avoid the starboard decks for now, the engineers tried something with capacitors yesterday and we still haven’t patched up all the holes.”</p><p align="justify">Very reassuring.</p><p align="justify">“And when do we get suits like yours so we won’t die if we open the wrong door?”</p><p align="justify">“Not yet. You’ll need to prove you are trustworthy before we give you any gear or access to the most sensitive parts of the ship.”</p><p align="justify">“How are we supposed to do that if you don’t give us anything to work with?”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t know. And to be frank, I don’t care. I’m only here because I drew the short wand when the Captain asked for someone on our team to show you around.”</p><p align="justify">“And I’m here to guard you!” Luna piped up enthusiastically. ”We’re still not sure if the ship’s haunted, you know. There might be alien ghosts floating around that we haven’t seen yet. So stay close and don’t wander off.”</p><p align="justify">Her eye twitching, Daphne struggled to keep her mouth shut and tried to tune the nonsense out. Despite her best efforts, however, she still ended up looking over her shoulder every time a noise echoed in the halls of the ship the following week.</p><hr /><p align="justify">“You apologise to him.“</p><p align="justify">“What?”</p><p align="justify">“Apologise.”</p><p align="justify">“Seamus, it’s alright.”</p><p align="justify">“No, it’s not.”</p><p align="justify">“But I-”</p><p align="justify">The door hissed, revealing a Harry Potter who did not like what he had walked on one bit.</p><p align="justify">“What the hell is going on here?”</p><p align="justify">This lounge was one of the smaller ones that dotted the arms of the station, used when people did not want to trek to the large one in the central axis. Its proximity to the training room made it a regular hang-out spot for the combat team especially, though only two of them were present at the moment and at opposite ends of an argument.</p><p align="justify">“I just wanted to know about-” Goyle attempted to defend himself.</p><p align="justify">“Just wanted to know? Then why the hell did call him a Mudblood?”</p><p align="justify">“But that’s not what I meant.”</p><p align="justify">Great. As if this whole cohabitation thing wasn’t hard enough already.</p><p align="justify">Behind Seamus, Justin looked far more embarrassed and uncomfortable at the scene than hurt, and even gave a pleading look to Harry.</p><p align="justify">“Enough!”</p><p align="justify">Used to orders by now, Seamus clenched his jaw, another shout dying in his throat while Goyle stood straight, his lips pressed into a thin line.</p><p align="justify">“You used that slur?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, but not-”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t care. There’s no excuse. As long as you’re under my command, I won’t tolerate this blood purism shite. Apologise.”</p><p align="justify">Goyle turned toward Justin with clenched fists, deliberately avoiding looking at Seamus.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry.”</p><p align="justify">“It’s alright.” Justin shook his head. “I could tell you didn’t mean it like that.”</p><p align="justify">“He’s not even-”</p><p align="justify">“And you.” Harry interrupted Seamus, his tone no less angry. “We’re all in the same boat here. You have a problem with someone, you bring it to Hannah or me. Is that clear?”</p><p align="justify">“But-”</p><p align="justify">“Is that clear?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, sir.” Seamus said behind clenched teeth, glaring at Goyle.</p><p align="justify">“Good. Now go back to your rooms for the night before I make you all scrub the hull or something.”</p><p align="justify">Without another word, the three boys left the room and went their separate ways, Justin giving a grateful nod to Harry as they went.</p><p align="justify">Once alone, Harry slumped onto the sofa with a tired sigh.</p><p align="justify">With altercations like this one occurring every other day, the past week had been ... Trying. Nonetheless, by most accounts, their new crew members had taken well to their new duties, despite the restrictions they had imposed on them.</p><p align="justify">It didn’t stop him from wondering if he had made the wrong choice.</p><hr /><p align="justify">“Think you can pop by the conjurator after this, Tony? The mandrakes are getting a bit too old for their pots and we don’t have enough soil to fill the new ones.”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, just let me finish with this one.” Anthony stepped back from a large Venomous Tentacula, holding shears in his gloved hands. “The little bugger isn’t happy with my trimming.”</p><p align="justify">“Because you’re cutting it too close to the main vine.” Neville put down the large pot he was carrying to join him near the trays filled with the fanged plants. “You need to leave a bit of-”</p><p align="justify">The door on the far side of the room opened and Hannah stepped into their not-so-little garden, closely followed by two other girls in green-trimmed robes. Stopping in his tracks, Neville nervously wiped his hands on his thick leather apron and gave a quick look around to make sure the place wasn’t too messy. They’d moved around some shoots in the morning to try out a new fertilizer and—</p><p align="justify">“Ouch!” Neville turned around, wand in hand, to see Anthony pulling off his left glove to inspect his wrist, where a nasty purple bulge was growing by the second. “Damn thing bit me.”</p><p align="justify">Sighing as he felt the tension leave his body, Neville put his wand away.</p><p align="justify">“You should get to the infirmary. Their poison isn’t lethal, but it’ll hurt like hell in a few minutes.”</p><p align="justify">“Great ... See you later.”</p><p align="justify">Holding his wrist, Anthony walked away as Hannah approached, the two newcomers following her giving him apprehensive looks.</p><p align="justify">“Hello, Neville.”</p><p align="justify">“H-hello.” Not knowing what to do with his hands, Neville picked up the abandoned shears. “What brings you down here? Not that you’re not welcome, it’s just—we don’t get many visitors.”</p><p align="justify">“That might change sooner than you think.” Hannah smiled, turning toward her charges. “This is Astoria, Daphne’s sister, and you already know Millicient, of course.”</p><p align="justify">“Right, of course. Welcome to the crew.” After sharing classes with her for five years, it would have been hard not to know the dour girl who gave him a gruff huff. No changes there it seemed. Though it was at least better than Astoria, who stood a good head smaller than her housemate and kept looking at the plants around them fearfully as if she thought they would attack her at any moment. “You’re introducing them to everyone?”</p><p align="justify">“Not exactly. Millicent here is quite interested in herbology you see.” Crossing her arms, the girl in question gave him a cold look and raised her chin, daring him to comment on it. “I thought that she could give you and Anthony a hand since you’re doing a lot of work for two people.”</p><p align="justify">“Really? That’d be great. We definitely could use the help.”</p><p align="justify">While a good part of the plants they had brought aboard Requirement and Neptune station were for their enjoyment, the garden and greenhouses had quickly become a vital part of their life in space. Although the conjurator could make all the food and tools they could wish for, it remained incapable of replicating the magical properties and enchantments of the object they tried to replicate.</p><p align="justify">A conjured Firebolt would only be useful to sweep the floor and any attempt to replicate a potion would only yield weird-tasting drinks. With the war closing more of their suppliers every week and the prospect of leaving Earth behind to explore the galaxy, they had decided to become their own suppliers and started growing their ingredients. Of course, the animal parts were still a problem, but there was a rumour going around that Lavender was in talks with magical reserves and menageries to procure a few.</p><p align="justify">Merlin, he hoped they didn’t try to bring a Nundu or a Dragon on board.</p><p align="justify">Anyway, difficult help was better than no help, and they sure could use an extra pair of hands. Hopefully, she would warm up to them soon enough.</p><p align="justify">“Perfect.” Damn, her smile was bright. He would not mind seeing it more often. Maybe he could find an excuse to visit her tomorrow? “Astoria isn’t sure of what she’d like to do yet so I’ve been showing her what everyone is doing. Do you think you could accompany her for the afternoon and—”</p><p align="justify">“Well, well, well. What do we have here?”</p><p align="justify">“The catch of the day, dear brother.”</p><p align="justify">The four of them looked up to the high branches of the trees that grazed the ceiling far above where a pair of red-haired twins sat comfortably. Resting Between them on the branch was a cartoonishly large and garishly coloured bomb of all things, leaving no doubt to their intentions.</p><p align="justify">“And what a catch! Two of which we haven’t had the pleasure to meet yet, even.”</p><p align="justify">“A travesty, if there ever was one.”</p><p align="justify">“Fred, George...” Her grin had disappeared, replaced by caution as she moved herself between Astoria and the twins. “I don’t know what you’re planning but this is not the time for pranks.”</p><p align="justify">“Aww, don’t be like that Hannah.” With a wide smile, one of them gave a few pats to the oversized bomb. “We just wanted to share some of the amazing things this ship can do with our guests.”</p><p align="justify">“Guys, this isn’t funny.” Putting aside the shears, Neville stepped in front of Hannah, wand in hand. “We have rare plants we’d have a hard time finding again in here.”</p><p align="justify">“You hurt me, Neville.”</p><p align="justify">“You? What about me?”</p><p align="justify">“Us. You hurt us.”</p><p align="justify">“Better.”</p><p align="justify">“Hush you.” Turning aside from their bickering, the twin—Fred maybe?—brought up his wand to the very short fuze. “You’d think you would have learned by now that nothing can stop us.”</p><p align="justify">A small flame emerged from the tip of the wand, lighting the fuze as the twins pushed the bomb over the edge.</p><p align="justify">Hannah threw herself on top of Astoria while Millicent dove behind a tree for cover. Raising his wand high, Neville materialized a glimmering shield in mid-air, only for the bombe to pass right through it, falling unimpaired toward them as the fuze ran out.</p><p align="justify">Neville shut his eyes and shielded his head with his arms moments before the laugh of the twins and the loud explosion was heard ... but not felt.</p><p align="justify">“Hmm ... Not enough sugar I think.”</p><p align="justify">“I told you! And it’s not solid enough. You were too heavy-handed with the milk.”</p><p align="justify">He opened his eyes, expecting to see his garden ravaged and greenhouses devastated, only to see the ground covered in thick white cream. Standing in the middle of the white sea that had somehow spared everything and everyone else, the twins were tasting the cream as if nothing was amiss.</p><p align="justify">“Guys ... What the hell?”</p><p align="justify">“Ah! Back with us?”</p><p align="justify">“What do you think Nev? Is it good?”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t...” He looked down at his clothes, finding no trace of the cream. He looked back at the twins, bewildered. “What is this?”</p><p align="justify">“A bit slow, innit?” One of the twins—he was pretty sure this was George now—took a handful of cream off the floor and offered it to him. “Why don’t you have a taste?”</p><p align="justify">With an uncertain hand, Neville tried to take a piece, only for his hand to pass right through George’s, which became a multicoloured blur for an instant before reforming itself, prompting another laughing fit.</p><p align="justify">Looking around once more, making sure that nothing had been damaged and taking in the absurdity of the situation, Neville finally let himself relax and joined in their laughter while the others got back up.</p><p align="justify">“Your plants are fine. Nothing to fear.”</p><p align="justify">“We’ve found this nifty little program and we just had to try it out.”</p><p align="justify">“Holograms! What do you think?”</p><p align="justify">“Bloody confusing, that’s what. So you aren’t really here?”</p><p align="justify">“Nope!”</p><p align="justify">“We’re in the main storage room right now.”</p><p align="justify">“In hindsight, not the best place to detonate a cream bomb. Everything is covered in it now.”</p><p align="justify">“Alright, I admit, this was good.” Neville pocketed his wand, a large grin on his face as he tried to repress another laugh. “Though you really should have tied it from further away.”</p><p align="justify">“Please, who do you take us for? This is nothing.”</p><p align="justify">“This thing has a range of thousands of kilometres.”</p><p align="justify">“We already managed to surprise Lee back in Diagon when Requirement was in orbit yesterday.”</p><p align="justify">“Not what I meant.”</p><p align="justify">In the corner of his eye, he could see Astoria drying her tears in Millicent’s robes while Hanna opened the door, wand in hand and fury in her eyes.</p><p align="justify">“Weasleys!”</p><p align="justify">“If I were you, I wouldn’t have done it from the next room over.”</p><p align="justify">The twins looked at each other in terror before turning tails. They tried to run for a door only they saw, but slipped in the cream and fell head-first in it before their projections disappeared, returning the garden to its pristine glory.</p><p align="justify">“So, girls.” Neville turned toward them with his most reassuring smile. “Want to see what we’ve been working on lately?</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="justify">“Come on. You can do it.”</p><p align="justify">Lee’s encouragement might have been heartwarming in another situation, but they only served to distract Hermione while she was focusing with all of her will not to look down.</p><p align="justify">Or up.</p><p align="justify">Or anywhere except toward the <em> Requirement’s </em>stern which grew ever closer as she hobbled forward on her hoverboard.</p><p align="justify">This ship was way too big and any wrong move would send her to drift into the void where she would die and oh god why had she agreed to do this it’s mad and only a mad person would agree to it this wasn’t safe by any definition of the word.</p><p align="justify">Just because she had designed the thing did not mean she had to be the one to install it, right? Same as the hoverboards. Sure, she had been the one to design them, but it didn’t mean she liked using one to float in deep space with it!</p><p align="justify">The absence of gravity was not exactly helping, and her hands hurt from grasping the safety cable she had insisted on using, knowing that her life could very well depend on it.</p><p align="justify">“Everything alright out here?”</p><p align="justify">Bridget sounded impatient.</p><p align="justify">Had she already been outside long enough for that? Was she too slow?</p><p align="justify">She knew she could not have left the airlock more than a few minutes ago, but she did not dare to look behind to see how far she had come. She was torn between taking as long as she would need to do this as safely as she could and rushing to end it as soon as possible.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, we’re almost there. Come on Hermione, just a bit further... Here.”</p><p align="justify">As fast as she could, Hermione let go of the cable with one hand to grasp at the one Lee was holding out for her. With his help, she stepped off the hoverboard and set foot on the ship’s hull, the magnetic lock of her boots engaging when Lee pressed one of the buttons on her left vambrace.</p><p align="justify">“Thanks.”</p><p align="justify">“No problem.” Despite the full face plating of his helmet, she could hear the smile in his voice. The clear visors had disappeared from the new deep space suits they were wearing, one of the many changes along a much thicker undersuit and reinforced plating that limited their range movements in exchange for the added protection. “We’re in position. You can conjure the first module.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">“Alright, here it comes.”</p><p align="justify">Bridget moved a command stone on her console and a flash of white light engulfed the screen behind it, disappearing shortly after to once again display a view of the rear side of the ship. In it, their two space-bound “astronauts” were already busing themselves, waving wands and tools around the large armoured pod she had conjured for them.</p><p align="justify">“How long will it take to install the modules?”</p><p align="justify">She was so focused on watching the work of the two people she still had trouble calling her superior officers—Merlin did that sound weird. They were all kids, not soldiers!—that Potter’s question startled her. He had been so quiet since he had come in a few minutes ago, barely acknowledging her presence with a greeting before returning to whatever he was reading on his data-slate, that she had almost forgotten he was here.</p><p align="justify">“We hope to attach half of the pods today and the rest tomorrow. Once we’re sure they’re holding we’ll have to install the capacitors and link them to the ship’s ... power grid?” Despite being more used to muggle terms than most of her housemates, the sheer amount of information the other engineers had tried to cram into her head these last weeks would have made a N.E.W.T. student-run for the hills. “That should take the better parts of the next two weeks. We’ll still need to run some tests, but after that, we’ll be ready to go.”</p><p align="justify">“And we’re sure this will work? I don’t want to get everyone’s hopes up only for the engines to blow up when we turn them on.”</p><p align="justify">“Everything has so far in the simulations. Boot has come up with a proper testing protocol so we can avoid anything like that after the explosion last month.”</p><p align="justify">Or at least that’s what she’d been told. At the time her most pressing concern had been her exams and not modifying a millennia-old alien spaceship.</p><p align="justify">Still, she was nothing if not a fast learner and on top of studying Maths and Physics, she had quickly gotten up to speed with most of the projects her team had been working on.</p><p align="justify">As of late, most of their efforts had been focused on solving the energy generation problem that prevented the ship from travelling to other star systems, something she was still trying to wrap her head around. While the ship had been designed to not only do so but also to travel between galaxies, the very same thing that had allowed Potter and his friends to find it was also what stopped them from doing it themselves. </p><p align="justify">The ship had expended its reserves of the elements required to fuel the main reactors, stranding it in their system, and the replacement they had cobbled together was so much less powerful that it was not even funny. Even less so when the hyperdrive, which allowed the ship to travel through an alternate dimension called subspace where they could reach faster-than-light speeds relative to their own dimension—as if all of this wasn’t insane enough already—required prodigious amounts of energy to function.</p><p align="justify">Several options had been considered, including the cannibalization of other systems which used said elements so that they could power the main reactor. While the idea would have most likely worked, they would have had no way to repair these systems and the fuel would have been consumed in the first jump, leaving them stranded far from Earth if they did not find another source at their destination. Needless to say, this idea had not gathered much support among the crew.</p><p align="justify">As such, the engineers had to find a solution that would only use the available resources, of which they had more than they could need thanks to the station mining them out of Neptune, and were common enough to be found in any system they could visit.</p><p align="justify">The idea they had gone with, while neither energy-efficient nor elegant, was to increase their energy production simply by adding more fusion reactors to the ship. After several prototypes, they were now installing them in semi-detached armoured modules on the hull, well within range of the ship’s conjurator array, allowing for their automatic refuelling without reducing too much of the ship’s storage space that would be used to store said fuel.</p><p align="justify">Their attempts at redesigning the reactor to fit in the modules had been a learning experience on the tensile strength of certain metals and the retrieval of exploded debris floating away in space, but everything had worked out in the end.</p><p align="justify">With half a dozen of these new reactors attached to the ship, along with massive supercapacitors to store the excess energy, they would be able to accumulate power over time to compensate for huge and punctual power drains like the opening of a hyperspace window.</p><p align="justify">This solution still came with its limitations, though, as replenishing the reserves took time and their fuel supplies would deplete themselves far quicker than their current rate. While they would not be able to jump between two galaxies, they had estimated their maximum jumping capabilities to be in the hundreds of light years. This was more than enough for them to go out and explore the galaxy in search of the materials required to change to a more efficient system.</p><p align="justify">“Good. I know the twins aren’t happy with all the new regulations, but we already came close to disaster several times and enough is enough.”</p><p align="justify">“You know, when you say it like that I think I’m glad we joined up so late.” Bridget rotated the command stone on the console, bringing up another angle of the ship’s stern to follow Lee and Hermione’s work. “With everything I’ve heard, it’s a miracle you didn’t blow yourself up months ago.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes well, we learned quickly after the first few accidents.”</p><p align="justify">When Potter moved closer to watch the screen, Bridget got a glimpse of his data-slate. Names, addresses, pictures ... tens of them maybe. All of them were adults and marked with a green rune. Recruiting outside the castle maybe? Or listing You-Know-Who’s people?</p><p align="justify">Was she even allowed to ask what it was, or was it one of those things they still kept from them? She knew more about the ship and it’s inner-workings than almost everyone outside the engineering team and yet they still refused to talk about their part in the war. Though now that she knew just what they had been doing, she could understand their caution ... not that she didn't find it infuriating.</p><p align="justify">“Anyway, things seem to be going well.” Potter turned and walked away disinterestedly, putting down his data-slate on the main console before leaving. “Call me if anything comes up.”</p><p align="justify">And just like that, she was left alone on the bridge. Which, seriously, what the hell?</p><p align="justify">Couldn’t they either treat them like dangerous guests and guard them at all times or trust them completely? This weird middle ground where they enforced restrictions and yet gave them complete access to their systems was almost insulting.</p><p align="justify">Bridget was fuming as she picked up a second command stone and placed it on the console brusquely, conjuring a new batch of equipment for the team outside. She turned away from the screen, looking at the forgotten data-slate as if its very presence was offending. Morgana’s tits, she only had to walk up to it and she could access all the sensitive information they were keeping from her if she wanted to. Or use the main console to lock down the ship and take it for herself or whatever. </p><p align="justify">Were they really this careless?</p><p align="justify">She shook her head and went back to work, muttering under her breath about children playing with things they shouldn’t and half-assed security.</p><hr /><p align="justify">Walking down a nearby corridor, Harry had procured another data-slate and was intently watching the surveillance feed of the bridge where an irate girl shook her head and focused back on the secondary console in front of her.</p><p align="justify">As he put the slate away, a proud smile tugged at his lips.</p><hr /><p align="justify">The stale air of the caves rushed through Harry’s hair as he pulled on yet another lever on the infernal contraption’s control panel. Racing on the hanging high rails, the cart rotated on its axis as it abruptly changed course.</p><p align="justify">Behind him, somehow maintaining his balance as he stood on the passenger seats, Dumbledore was sending spell after spell at their pursuers. Despite the Headmaster’s swift wand, it seemed like every time one of the carts full of Death Eaters pursuing them toppled over into the abyss, two more emerged from side tunnels, hoping to cut them off.</p><p align="justify">Harry ducked when he saw a flash of green in the corner of his eye, swearing when it exploded against the ceiling, sending one of the giant stalactites crashing down on the rails. Pushing the main lever to the left with all his strength, Harry managed to force the cart to turn once more, sending them into a side tunnel.<br /><br />As they plunged ever deeper into the Earth, he could only hope that another down the line would allow them to come back up. Though knowing his luck, things were never that simple. The shouts and grinding of wheels on rails growing closer behind them at least made him sure of it.</p><p align="justify">And to think that this evening had begun so well.</p><p align="justify">After numerous inquiries and some unusually forthcoming Goblins, Dumbledore had managed to track down the second to last Horcrux, Hufflepuff’s cup. The bankers were not quite exactly thrilled at the idea of letting them steal it from one of their vaults, however, and had only agreed to it for a price.</p><p align="justify">Surprising no one, it seemed like the little buggers had a peculiar view on ownership. Especially when dealing with their craftsmen’s work. In addition to a sizable sum, they had demanded the restitution of Gryffindor’s sword.</p><p align="justify">Which, seeing as it was their only safe way of destroying the Horcruxes, was problematic, to say the least.</p><p align="justify">The Goblins had been uncompromising at first and only agreed after many concessions and the re-negotiation of their deal with them. He could still hear Justin’s complaints as he tore his own work to shreds for reasons Harry was not ready to share.</p><p align="justify">While suspicious of their turnabout, a grateful Dumbledore was allowed to buy a new lease on the sword, one that would allow him to keep it until the time of his death, at which point it would be returned to the family of the original craftsman.</p><p align="justify">With the Goblins’ approval, Harry accompanied Dumbledore through the depths of the bank after business hours in search of the vaults of Voldemort’s inner circle. After repeatedly digging around piles of gold and outdated jewellery, they finally found and destroyed the small golden cup inside the Lestrange vault.</p><p align="justify">It still seemed strange that such an unassuming thing could house the soul of a psychotic madman.</p><p align="justify">Of course, things could not go according to plan. They had not even left the vault when a whole slew of Death Eaters had come bearing down on them. Maybe the vault had been protected by wards and enchantments that even the Goblins had not known about, or maybe they had decided that they did not want to wait to reclaim their sword. Either way, Harry and Dumbledore had forced their way out of the vault, past the warm corpse of the dragon and onto one of the carts, turning the trap into a chase as the Death Eaters rained down curses upon them.<br /><br />While piloting a mine cart held together by wishes and magic through dark tunnels and fighting off a dozen dark wizards did not leave one with much time to ponder on their situation, two things had become clear. </p><p align="justify">For one, their little Horcrux hunt was no longer a secret from Voldemort. This would be quite a large problem If they lived through this.</p><p align="justify">For another, the Goblins would be pissed. He could hear the spells crashing down on Dumbledore’s shields before the tunnel’s walls exploded, showering them with debris.</p><p align="justify">Not for the first time that night, Harryt cursed himself for leaving his suit and helmet back on the ship, secrecy be damned.</p><p align="justify">They came out of the tunnel before the Death Eaters managed to bury them, emerging in a wide circular cavern supported by pillars as thick as houses. In its centre, a building that resembled a Roman coliseum rose toward the faraway ceiling, its countless archways housing the fortified doors of vaults as impressive as the Lestrange’s. The sight of another chained dragon resting in what would have been the arena, right by the only rails he could see going back up made him sigh.</p><p align="justify">How was this his life?</p><p align="justify">“Hang on tight professor!”</p><p align="justify">Holding the main lever with a firm hand, Harry waved his wand in a complex pattern in front of him with the other.</p><p align="justify"> ”Sulatatud Raud!”</p><p align="justify">A jet of silver light hit the next fork in the rails and the sound of bending metal echoed in the cavern as the rails forcefully switched paths and fused themselves. Bellow them, the dragon opened its blind eyes and raised his horned head toward them to watch as the cart began its mad descent toward the coliseum.</p><p align="justify">“Harry?”</p><p align="justify">“Just hang on!”</p><p align="justify">Spells rained down all around them, crashing on Dumbledore’s shield and the surrounding vaults as the other carts forcefully joined them on the descending track, further agitating the dragon. The beast spread its wings, rising from the ornate stone floor and roared its discontent for all to hear while miss-aimed curses splashed harmlessly on its hide.</p><p align="justify">Struggling to keep his hold on the controls as their speed and the destruction around them shook the cart, threatening to throw them off-rails, Harry pushed them even further. The cart’s frame groaned under them as it lurched forward, further accelerating their descent. The wheels sent sparks as they raced down the rails at a speed Harry was more accustomed to reaching on a broom, sending them right in the direction of the irate dragon.</p><p align="justify">“Harry!”</p><p align="justify">All traces of confusion had left Dumbledore’s voice, leaving only the urgent shrill of panic shared by the shouts of their pursuers.</p><p align="justify">“Hang. On.” Harry managed to say through teeth gritted so hard they might break.</p><p align="justify">Their cart shot through the coliseum and broke a wooden barrier as they passed through the station without stopping. With their speed, they crossed most of the coliseum in seconds, the silhouette of the dragon growing closer and more imposing with each of them.</p><p align="justify">Locking them in place with a foot, Harry finally released his grip on the controls and got up in his seat before turning to face their pursuers. His eyes met Dumbledore’s fearful ones for an instant, leaving his silent question unanswered as he focused on the rails behind them. He raised his wand in jagged movements, fighting against the wind hitting him and ignoring the cold sweat running down his back as he thought back to the time when a blond-haired boy had taught him this spell.</p><p align="justify">“Maceria Lapidea!”</p><p align="justify">Behind them, the floor beneath the track exploded when a massive lump of rock emerged from the ground, showering the arena with dust and debris. The cavern echoed the dragon’s roar and the cries of the Death Eaters as they crashed upon it, drowning even Harry’s whoop.</p><p align="justify">“Get down!”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore’s shout was his only warning, and only months of training allowed him to throw himself back in his seat in time, wincing as he hit his shoulder on the control panel. Sprawled on the metal chair, he saw an enormous scaled paw with claws the size of his arm whip the air above him before their speed carried them to a safe distance.</p><p align="justify">“Are you alright?”</p><p align="justify">“I’ll live.” He pushed himself back up onto the seat, his shoulder throbbing in disapproval. “Now let’s get out of here.”</p><p align="justify">He took hold of the commands once more and they lurched forward, picking up their dwindling speed as they climbed out of the cavern, leaving it in chaos as the remaining Death Eaters tried to flee the enraged dragon on foot.</p><p align="justify">When they finally made it back to the surface, he chanced a look behind them, finding no other cart climbing the slope of the main tunnel.</p><p align="justify">“Well. That could have gone worse.”</p><p align="justify">The look Dumbledore gave him was only matched by the ridiculous state of his windswept hair and beard. After a moment, the corner of his mouth twitched and a familiar twinkle shone behind his spectacles.</p><p align="justify">“Yes. I suppose it could have.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">Somewhere on the coast of Great Britain, a figure draped in billowing dark robes slashed the air with their wand, vanishing the rock face to reveal the gaping mouth of a cave.</p><p align="justify">Walking at a furious pace, they crossed the threshold and ventured into the darkness with a confidence born of familiarity.</p><p align="justify">When they reached the shores of a great black lake so large one could not discern the distant banks, their pace did not falter as they rose into the air, flying unimpaired to a barren island.</p><p align="justify">When a hand as pale as death itself plunged into the green waters of the stone basin, pulling out an ornate locket by its chain, time seemed to stand still.</p><p align="justify">A serpentine hiss was met with silence and two eyes squinted, their blood-red irises filled with far too familiar emotions.</p><p align="justify">Long and delicate fingers took hold of the heavy locket, bringing the light to reflect on its many crystal facets where no initial inlaid in green stone could be seen.</p><p align="justify">The shout fuelled by rage, grief and fear echoed in the cavernous chamber when Lord Voldemort threw the offensive fake into the lake.</p><p align="justify">Far to the north, Harry Potter was making his way back to the seventh floor, holding his head as a painful ache he had not felt in a long time raged behind his scar.</p><hr /><p align="justify">“Hello, Ms Edgecomb.”</p><p align="justify">The twenty-year-old Private entered the store, announced by the greeting of the doormat—"Boldly come!"—as Clarissa Edgecomb came out of the office, her arms full of parchment rolls.</p><p align="justify">“Good morning Toby. Are you alright?”</p><p align="justify">“Hardly slept a wink.” While his tired features were apparent, it did not stop him from grinning from ear to ear. “I kept thinking that this is it. We’re finally done.”</p><p align="justify">“That we are.” Clarissa could not stop the smile on her lips at the thought of completing what had been months of work as she put down the parchments on the counter. “Though you should still take the time to rest. We’ll need you at your best for the next few days”<br /><br />“I know, I know. But once it’s done I’ll be transferred up there you know? I just can’t wait.” Toby walked up to the counter, taking off his messenger bag and dropping it to the ground. “Is this it?”</p><p align="justify">“Part of it at least. The rest is still in the back.”</p><p align="justify">Taking a parchment off the pile, she unrolled it to reveal a list of names, addresses and the roles most suited to their set of skills should they agree to take the job. Despite all the time she had spent vetting the candidates with Toby and Hannah, she could still find a few names that she did not recognize. Those Creevy boys had done a wonderful job getting the American branch of <em> Enterprise </em>up and running and it seems their candidates had made the cut.<br /><br />“I have a kettle on the stove. I was thinking that we could use a cuppa before writing all these letters. Would you mind taking care of it while I prepare things here?”</p><p align="justify">“Ms Edgecomb, you’re a saint. I’ll go get it.”</p><p align="justify">Toby disappeared in the back of the store, to the small rec room they shared with the Granger’s practice. After checking that the sign on the front door was still announcing the store as closed, Clarissa pulled out quills, inkwells and blank parchments from the shelves.</p><p align="justify">She liked these moments. When the warm rays of the spring sun shined through the storefront and all she could hear were the familiar sounds of the parchment and the distant whistle of the kettle. It was an oasis of peace and simplicity the gloom and folly that had taken over her world.</p><p align="justify">She knew what was happening out there, and she had heard about how the crew had been helping people. She just did not expect to hear that they had thrown themselves into the fight when they had not even graduated yet!</p><p align="justify">She had not known Lieutenant MacMillan very well. Mostly, she had only spoken with him to report the happenings of the shop when Lee had been busy with one project or another. Still, to hear that such a sweet boy—just a year younger than Marietta!—had died ... It had been quite a shock.</p><p align="justify">She just hoped that Marietta would remain safe on the ship and far from all of this violence.</p><p align="justify">She was reaching for the stacks of envelopes under the counter when she froze, the ground shaking beneath her feet while a deep rumble could be heard in the distance.</p><p align="justify">“Ms Edgecomb?” Toby called from the back. “Is everything alright?”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t know...”</p><p align="justify">Her heart was racing.</p><p align="justify">She was worrying for nothing. It was probably just Mr Rowland trying some new potion recipes down the street again.</p><p align="justify">The ground shook anew and a few of the parchments fell off the counter. The rumbling was louder and closer this time, and if she strained her ear, she could almost hear voices.</p><p align="justify">With trembling steps, she approached the storefront, ignoring Toby’s calls as she saw people fleeing down the street.</p><p align="justify">Her blood turned cold when she saw them.</p><p align="justify">Half a dozen figures, draped in dark robes and hidden behind masks, throwing spells at stores and people alike.</p><p align="justify">Death Eaters. Out in the open.</p><p align="justify">“Toby! We have to-”</p><p align="justify">The glare of the sun reflected on a polished silver mask was the last thing she saw before a wand sliced through the air and the storefront exploded before her.</p>

  <p align="justify">Shards of wood and glass filled the air, the remnants of the storefront tearing through everything in their path.</p><p align="justify">Fear gave way to shock and shock to pain as Clarissa crashed onto the floor, the arms she had raised to protect her head hanging limply in a growing pool of her blood.</p><p align="justify">She heard shouts behind her, distant and muffled by a persistent ringing in her ears.</p><p align="justify">Clarissa could feel herself grow cold as her blood left her, despite the air becoming unbearably hot around her.</p><p align="justify">With effort, she opened her eyes, and the glare of the flames devouring the aisles around her almost made her close them again. Her eyelids were heavy, yet she knew they would forever remain shut if she allowed them to close.</p><p align="justify">Through the dark spots in her vision, she could see three dark figures standing on the other side of the gaping hole that had been the storefront, the flames engulfing the shop reflecting on their polished silver masks.</p><p align="justify">Their wands rose once more, the glow of magic at their tip, and her jumbled thoughts turned to Marietta and the terrifying comfort brought by the prospect of a quick release from her agony.</p><p align="justify">However, another kind of hope bloomed in her heart when the store shutters came crashing down, hiding the Death Eaters from view.</p><p align="justify">Muffled cries filled the air once more and she could feel multiple pairs of hands getting a hold of her. She felt herself be pulled back and her body warm up as a trembling wand moved over her.</p><p align="justify">Toby and the Grangers, trying to save her when death had already staked its claim on her. Of course they were. She was not the one they should be worried about, however.</p><p align="justify">Already, she could see the gold and silver shutters rattle against their frame, the reinforced metal groaning as it strained against the unseen assault.</p><p align="justify">“No... Leave me...”</p><p align="justify">Her broken body had been dragged no further than the counter when she was thrown to the ground once more. Her head hit the floor, sending a new flare of pain and blurring her view of the world that shook all around her.</p><p align="justify">And yet, she could see them, their black robes standing out against the burning remains of her shop like dark holes in the fabric of the world, advancing inexorably to extinguish their lives.</p><p align="justify">In a cruel boon, the world stopped turning and the ringing in her ears diminished, bringing into focus the roar of the flames and the trembling face of Toby as he stepped in front of her, wand in hand.</p><p align="justify">She did not want to see or hear what was to come. She did not want the last thing she saw to be Toby’s death.</p><p align="justify">“Hey, arseholes! You really so ugly that you need to wear masks to hide your mugs?”</p><p align="justify">The shout cut through the sombre atmosphere, filled with cocky assurance and anger.</p><p align="justify">Toby’s legs gave out and revealed the three figures turning their backs on them, their wands raised toward the street where Lee Jordan stood alone, his arms crossed and his face twisted in anger.</p><p align="justify">“What? Nothing? God, your boss is pants at picking his goons. You don’t even know how to shop without wrecking the place.”<br />
<br />
The cold grip of dread grasped Clarissa’s heart.</p><p align="justify">He should not be here. No one else had to die. Had he brought other children to fight?</p><p align="justify">Oh Merlin, Marietta...</p><p align="justify">Nonpulsed by the insults, the Death Eaters moved as one, slashing the air with their wands as vicious green and yellow curses flew toward Lee.</p><p align="justify">And passed right through him.</p><p align="justify">“No, really, it’s almost sad to watch. Can’t find good help these days. Though it might have something to do with how you’re trying to kill half of the workforce.”</p><p align="justify">More spells were flung at him, each leaving him unarmed as they passed through his body to crash on the boarded-up storefront behind him to the growing irritation of their casters.</p><p align="justify">“What trickery is this?”</p><p align="justify">“The distracting kind.”</p><p align="justify">Appearing out of thin air behind them, three teenagers in familiar suits—two in green and silver and one in blue and bronze—sent a red spell to the unsuspecting Death Eaters’ backs. They collapsed to the ground like puppets whose strings had been cut, the new arrivals breaking their wands as Lee’s image blurred and disappeared.</p><p align="justify">“Mum!” The blue figure ripped off her helmet, revealing a face Clarissa had thought she would never see again as she rushed to her side. “Mum, I’m so sorry. We took too long and-”<br />
<br />
“Marietta...”<br />
<br />
“Don’t talk. Oh Merlin, don’t talk.” Her face was stained with tears and twisted in fear. “Don’t worry, we’re getting you out of here.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">Spells rushed past Percy as he threw himself into a compartment, landing painfully on top of a passenger’s shoes.</p><p align="justify">“Terribly sorry for that.” Ignoring the cries of the terrified Muggles, Percy put his glasses back in place as he pulled himself back up. “Just wait a bit longer, we’ll have you out of here in no time.”</p><p align="justify">“Get the hell out!” One of the passengers, a middle-aged man with a prominent belly, grabbed a briefcase from the overhead luggage rack and bludgeoned Percy with it. “Get out! Get out! Get out!”</p><p align="justify">Ducking out of harm’s way, Percy walked back into the corridor with a wide horizontal motion of his wand. One of the Death Eaters waiting for him was violently thrown against the wall and slumped to the ground, unconscious.</p><p align="justify">As Percy ran for the next compartment, Flobert—one of the Order members accompanying him—peeked out of another to throw a few hexes before ducking back into cover.</p><p align="justify">This dance had been repeating for a while now and it had made their progress through the train far slower than Percy would have hoped. They had barely managed to evacuate the first car before the Death Eaters had found them out and since then they had to fight for each step they took.</p><p align="justify">Jules and Nance had already paid the ultimate price to free the last three cars, but had taken out their fair share of Death Eaters before they fell. It did not seem to matter, however, as for every dark wizard they fell, two more were waiting for them in the next car.</p><p align="justify">A cry of pain came from the corridor and Percy once again stepped into the line of fire. Fighting off the tears in his eyes and the bile in his throat, he ran over Terence’s body as it lay in a pool of blood and entrails on the carpeted floor. His blasting curse impacted a shield, blasting away the nearby window but leaving the Death Eater unarmed.</p><p align="justify">Cursing under his breath, Percy ran for the next compartment and tried the door. It refused to open. Behind its glass half, he could see the terrified faces of a family, looking back at him as they huddled together in a corner.</p><p align="justify">The unlocking charm was so simple that a first-year at Hogwarts could cast it. It was, however, far too slow. Already, he could see the light of an impending curse in the corner of his eye.</p><p align="justify">He threw himself to the ground, knowing that it would only make the next curse that much harder to avoid. </p><p align="justify">Only one way out now.</p><p align="justify">“Flobert!” He called out as the curse flew above him. “We’re leaving!”</p><p align="justify">Lounging forward and twisting his body in mid-air as he got up, Percy pushed the sight of the curse rushing toward him out of his mind and focused all his will on the memory of the Order’s Headquarters.</p><p align="justify">“For Morgana’s sake, don’t you get tired of getting yourself in these situations?”</p><p align="justify">His head impacted something hard and Percy fell back to the ground as the curse crashed on a blue-tinted shield not two feet from him. Appearing out of thin air in front of him was a familiar silhouette clad head to toe in gold and red.</p><p align="justify">“I swear, this is the last time I’m saving your arse.”</p><p align="justify">The girl raised her second arm in front of her and another shield sprang to life. Curse after curse crashed harmlessly upon her shields as she marched toward the Death Eaters, undeterred. When she reached them, they tried to retreat, only to find the door locked with another armoured figure waving at them from the other side. She made short work of the two men, knocking them out and breaking their wands.</p><p align="justify">“Not to be ungrateful,” Massaging the growing bump on his head, Percy pulled himself off the ground as Flobert came out of hiding, wand raised. Behind the girl, the car’s door clicked open and two similarly dressed figures walked in. “But who are you people?”</p><p align="justify">The newcomers did not even spare them a glance as they brought the unconscious Death Eaters’ arms to their back and into pearly white metallic tubes. With the press of a button, the tubes shrunk down, locking them into place like some sort of one-piece handcuffs.</p><p align="justify">“Reinforcements.” The girl’s shields disappeared with a sharp of her arms. “Now, we gonna stand here all day or you gonna lower the wand and make yourselves useful?”</p><p align="justify">The sight of his companions lying dead a few feet behind them still fresh in mind, Percy exchanged a look with Flobert before bringing up his own wand.</p><p align="justify">“We’ll need a bit more than that I’m afraid.”</p><p align="justify">“Ugh, we don’t have time for this!” With a soft hissing sound, the girl removed her helmet, revealing an all too familiar face framed by cropped ginger hair. “Happy?”</p><p align="justify">“Ginny?” Percy’s eyes went wide in shock and his wand arm went down faster than Charlie on Mum’s shepherd's pie. “What the hell are you doing here?”</p><p align="justify">“Saving your arse, that’s what. I should be the one asking you that! Last I heard you were working for those guys.”</p><p align="justify">In any other situation, Percy might have winced under her withering glare. Today, however...</p><p align="justify">“Saving my—I’m with the Order! You’re sixteen! You should be in school, not fighting on a bloody train!”</p><p align="justify">“Oh yes, because those NEWTs are really going to help when the Ministry will have razed the country!”</p><p align="justify">“Does Mum even know you’re here? Does anybody?” He walked up to her, fuzzing about her in search of any injury. “And those armours. Was it you at the Ministry? You’re gonna get yourself killed!”</p><p align="justify">“We can handle ourselves.” She looked past him as her gaze fell upon Terence’s remains. “Which is more than I can say for you at the moment.“</p><p align="justify">Percy did not know what to say. Indignation and concern battled in his throat and tied his tongue as he looked at Ginny. A Ginny so far removed from the little girl she had been when he had left the Burrow, turning his back on his family.</p><p align="justify">When had she turned so cold and serious? So used to violence and death that she could so callously disregard the death of a good man? Ginny and her friends had been fighting in this war for months now. Was it already too late to save their innocence? The childhood that had been robbed from them?</p><p align="justify">Could he have stopped it if he had stayed?</p><p align="justify">“Percy?”</p><p align="justify">Behind them, Flobert had lowered his wand and was now looking warily at the teenagers while holding his left side. </p><p align="justify">“It’s alright. They’re with us.” With a sigh, he turned back to Ginny. “Since you’re here, I assume you already know the Death Eaters have launched simultaneous raids across the entire country.”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, we know.” One of Ginny’s companions spoke up. “They’re not exactly being discreet about it either.”</p><p align="justify">“No, they’re not. We weren’t warned in time to stop them, so we’re mostly doing damage control and getting the Muggles out of here.” A shame most obliviators had been spared by the ideological purge at the Ministry and were still happily working for Malfoy. Even if they managed to stop the raids, the fallout would be disastrous. “We’ve already taken care of the care behind us, but we’ve encountered far more resistance than should be needed to take over the train. They-”</p><p align="justify">The train lurched forward, throwing them back as it picked up speed and turning the scenery on the other side of the window into a blur of colours.</p><p align="justify">Steadying himself on the wall of the car, Percy straightened his glasses in time to see Ginny put her strange helmet back on. He did not know whether its smooth metal surface or her glare was the more alien to him.</p><p align="justify">“Report.”</p><p align="justify">“We’re picking up serious speed and approaching London.” The third teenager, a girl dressed in bronze and gold, said urgently. “At this rate, it will crash when it arrives in the city.”</p><p align="justify">”We need to get to the locomotive and pull the break.”</p><p align="justify">“Hold on.” Percy stepped in as the three already turned toward the door. “They know we’re here. They’ll be waiting for us.”</p><p align="justify">“Then we split up.” She turned toward her companions. “Take mister ungrateful here and get the muggles off the train.” She glanced at Percy over her shoulder before walking away urgently. ”You’re with me.” </p><p align="justify">Percy exchanged one last look with Flobert before hurrying after his sister.</p><p align="justify">“Since when are you in charge?”</p><p align="justify">“Since you lost control of the situation.”</p><p align="justify">They came out of the car and onto the small platforms above the coupling. The air rushing by them made crossing the short distance arduous, each step having to be taken with the support of the grab bars on each side of the doors.</p><p align="justify">“By fighting while you snuck around! We didn’t have the element of surprise like you did.” His righteous anger and indignation fell on deaf ears as Ginny ignored him in favour of freeing and unfolding the service ladder to the roof. “You’re kidding.”</p><p align="justify">“Nope.”</p><p align="justify">“This is insane. Do you have any idea how fast we’re going right now?”</p><p align="justify">“Unless you know what the locomotive looks like so we can apparate there, it’s the quickest way. My board is too small to carry us both. Now come on. We don’t have much time.”</p><p align="justify">As Ginny climbed the ladder’s first steps, Percy resigned himself to the madness that had become his life. Grumbling under his breath, he cast a quick sticking charm on his glasses—an unpleasant necessity—and climbed after her. The fact that they held firmly on his nose when the wind hit him with the force of a brick wall at least counterbalanced the gross feeling of the metal frames glueing themselves to his skin.</p><p align="justify">Percy pushed himself onto the roof and steadied himself with Ginny’s help. Despite the wind and complete lack of anything to support herself, she stood straight in defiance of the elements.</p><p align="justify">“Mag-boots. Now hold on tight.” As he held on the armoured plates covering her shoulders for dear life, they began their march against the wind. “So, you’re with the Order now?”</p><p align="justify">“You want to do this now?” He shouted, the sound of his voice somehow reaching her.</p><p align="justify">“Not like I have any other time to ask.” He could feel her shrug beneath his grip. “You don’t even answer our letters anymore.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes well, I’ve been busy. And my mail was being watched.” He sighed. This was not the way he had wanted this discussion to happen. His careful plans of a quiet evening at the Burrow after the war shattered and joined the rest of his ambitions in the pile of his broken dreams. “I got in touch with Dad’s friends after Fudge died. I’m not proud it took me so long to see what the Ministry had become, but I’ve been trying to make it right you know?”</p><p align="justify">For a few moments, his only answer was the howling of the wind. They reached the end of the car and jumped onto the next, giving them a glimpse of the spellfire illuminating the train behind them.</p><p align="justify">“Does Mum know?”</p><p align="justify">“I...” More than the wind stopped the words in his throat as they resumed their march. “No. For months I worked anonymously, passing on classified information and warning them of Auror activity to my contact in the Order. When I had to flee, I went into hiding and didn’t see much of anyone for weeks.”</p><p align="justify">Another car coupling, another jump, and the locomotive was now in sight.</p><p align="justify">“You could have told us. Ask to meet us at headquarters. Passed along a message through your contact.”</p><p align="justify">“I know.” The accusation hit him like a punch. Not that he had not expected it. ”I wanted to go. To see her and tell her everything. To explain. But I... I just couldn’t. Not with everything still going on. Not when Dad... is still not back.”</p><p align="justify">“So you preferred letting us think that you hated us and that you were helping the Ministry. Smart move, that.”</p><p align="justify">“It’s not that simple! And what about you? Does Mum know you’re running around in that armour, fighting Death Eaters and sneaking into the Ministry? Does Ron?“</p><p align="justify">Ginny stopped and turned around, grasping his wrist to steady him. Despite the helmet, Percy could feel the burning glare of his sister.</p><p align="justify">“At least my secret isn’t breaking the heart of my family.”</p><p align="justify">She let go of him and he fell, scrambling to find something to hold as she climbed down a ladder. Gritting his teeth, Percy pushed against the wind and followed after her.</p><p align="justify">She was already opening the locomotive’s door when he came down the ladder, throwing herself toward the ambush as curses filled the air once more. She walked down the corridor undeterred, the barrage of spellfire crashed harmlessly on the shields coming out of her forearms until she reached the first compartment. She made quick work of the Death Eater inside, leaving his body to fall floor with those of the murdered Muggles already occupying it before continuing her march.</p><p align="justify">Whatever Ginny was involved with, at least it had her well protected.</p><p align="justify">Only twice did she have to dodge, when one hijacker more capable than the rabble leading this attack cast the killing curse.</p><p align="justify">And yet, he fell like the rest.</p><p align="justify">Percy covered her advance, cursing the Death Eaters from above her shields and taking out the one who attempted to surprise Ginny by apparating behind her.</p><p align="justify">“I’d scold you for jumping into danger like that, but I can’t argue with the result.”</p><p align="justify">The battle had been quick, the last Death Earter deciding to flee when he saw his last comrade fall.</p><p align="justify">“Now let’s stop this-” Hurrying to the front of the car, Percy opened the door to the driver’s compartment, revealing a gaping hole where the controls were supposed to be, cables and broken metal flailing in the wind. “...train.”</p><p align="justify">“Merlin’s rotten crotch!” No matter how long it had been, Ginny’s vocabulary remained colourful. “Couldn’t these arseholes be subtle, just once?”</p><p align="justify">“Language.”</p><p align="justify">“Soon there won’t be anyone to be offended by it.” Past the fields surrounding them, the grey mass of London was growing on the horizon at an alarming rate. “How is this thing even still working?”</p><p align="justify">“They must have jinxed the engine. Or maybe the wheels. This train won’t stop until it hits something.”</p><p align="justify">“It won’t.”</p><p align="justify">Ginny stepped into the remains of the compartment, her boots clamping down on the metal floor as she raised her wand high against the wind.</p><p align="justify">“Does Hogwarts teach curse-breaking now?”</p><p align="justify">“No, but I know a spell that can stop the inertia of the train. I’ll have to fight the jinx, but-.”</p><p align="justify">Behind them, thunderous cracks filled the corridor, delivering half a dozen black-robed figures with wands in hand. No doubt the one that had slipped away had called for backup.</p><p align="justify">“Muriel’s wrinkled tits!” Percy closed the door just in time to stop a yellow curse from hitting his head. “Can’t they leave us alone for five minutes?”</p><p align="justify">“Language!” Was this a touch of mirth he heard in her voice? “We don’t have time to take care of them. Can you hold them off?”</p><p align="justify">He wanted to say no. To grab her and apparate away, far from this madness and the doom that he could see grow closer on the horizon with each passing moment. They had done all they could, saving lives that would have otherwise been lost. There was no way they could stop this train in time. There was no shame in leaving to fight another day.</p><p align="justify">And yet, seeing her standing here, defiant against fate and the elements, he knew he could not say it.</p><p align="justify">She was counting on him, and he would not let his family down again.</p><p align="justify">“Start casting.”</p><p align="justify">Closing the door behind him, Percy ran into the corridor, his wand swishing through the air. His hand followed the incantations and flowed into the next with the precision that had once made him a straight Os student.</p><p align="justify">The fire extinguisher tore itself from the wall and exploded as it intercepted a curse, filling the car with white mist. Blinded, the Death Eaters never saw the trolley that flew toward one of them, its metal frame twisting around the body and squeezing tight as their spells hit the walls behind Percy. From the passenger compartments came the bags and briefcases, pummeling into them and making them trip. </p><p align="justify">Before he could finish his next spell, a pale flash of light came out of the mists and struck Percy in the stomach. Percy doubled over in pain, throwing up blood, his insides feeling wrong and far less solid than they should be. The sensation was accentuated by the feeling of the train decelerating, his insides moving around like a potion in a too-thin cauldron.</p><p align="justify">Gritting his bloodied teeth, Percy propped himself up against the wall and raised his trembling wand in a winding pattern. The Death Eater’s shout was short-lived as the howling wind sucked him and the dissipating mist out of the vanished window, revealing the four remaining.</p><p align="justify">Extending his arm as far as he could before bringing it back sharply, Percy tore the corridor’s floor into a makeshift wall in front of him. He heard another cry and could only hope that this trick had taken another Death Eater as he slumped to the ground. Percy dragged himself to the door, struggling to go through the motion of the locking charm before he leaned heavily against it.</p><p align="justify">“Perce?”</p><p align="justify">He could hear Ginny’s muffled voice through the door.</p><p align="justify">He tried to reply, his words uselessly choking on blood.</p><p align="justify">Already, he could see the wall he had raised go down and the Death Eaters advance.</p><p align="justify">They raised their wands as his own laid uselessly beside him, his strength eluding him.</p><p align="justify">He never could have that talk with his family.</p><p align="justify">“Confringo.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">And the world went up in flames.</p><p align="justify">“Is anyone here? Can you hear me?“</p><p align="justify">Neville’s shouts were drowned by the crackling of the purple flames licking the ancient walls of the apartment, filling the air with noxious smoke. With a thankful thought to the Weasley twins for the air filters of the suit, Neville ran through the smoke-filled hallway, straining his ear in hope of an answer.</p><p align="justify">He had arrived with Terry and Angelina not ten minutes ago to discover the outskirts of Manchester going up in flames. An entire district was burning, its inhabitants running in the streets while the firefighters had spread out what little manpower they had to contain the flames. Despite their best efforts, the magical fire was probing tenacious and entire blocs had already been turned to ashes.</p><p align="justify">When their own attempts at dousing the flames failed, the trio had spread out, apparating from one building to the next in search of survivors. Protected by their suits and flame-freezing charms, they had already managed to evacuate well over a dozen Muggles, yet no respite awaited them.</p><p align="justify">Neville kicked down a door, jumping away when fire burst out of the apartment from the backdraft, singing his side. The armoured plates of his suit spared him from the worst of it, but he could feel the head through the exposed parts. Whatever those flames were, direct contact seemed ill-advised.</p><p align="justify">Stepping inside the apartment, he felt the wooden floor shift under his weight. The foundations were already weakening and the building was coming down around him. A quick look over the room revealed a charred corpse and an unconscious man on the ground, a half-burnt beam pinning down the remains of his leg.</p><p align="justify">Pushing down the sick feeling in his stomach, Neville banished the beam away, freeing the man. Taking him in his arms, Neville palpated his throat, searching for a pulse before the building groaned around him. As quickly as he could, he lifted the man and turned on the spot, apparating away as the ceiling collapsed on them.</p><p align="justify">Down on the street, Neville put the man down next to the other survivors, exchanging a nod with Angelina before she apparated away with another, taking them to a hospital. Behind him, the six-story building collapsed, unable to support its own weight.</p><p align="justify">He had not gone past the third floor.</p><p align="justify">Tightening his grip on his father’s wand, Neville turned on the spot once more, apparating on the other side of a window of the next building, his search starting anew.</p><p align="justify">The first few apartments only housed the charred remains of trapped families, the right side of the building having collapsed and taken with it the stairs. Men, women, children, pets... the flames had spared none. Fighting the urge to vomit after witnessing the remains of a toddler in the arms of his father buried under bricks and wood, he apparated on the floor above through a hole in the ceiling.</p><p align="justify">“Anyone still here?” He moved through the floor, going from one ruined apartment to the next. “Shout if you can!”</p><p align="justify">“Help!” A woman’s voice answered. Distorted and barely discernible through the cacophony of the flames and falling debris, but a voice nonetheless. Someone was alive! “Help me!”</p><p align="justify">“I’m coming!”</p><p align="justify">Neville ran through the inferno, breaking the door blocking his path with a wave of his wand and emerged in a large living room. The flames had yet to breach the place, leaving it mostly intact. However, he could already see their glow through the cracks in the walls and floor.</p><p align="justify">Stanger still, was the absence of the woman who had cried out for him.</p><p align="justify">A heavy blow in his back threw him to the floor, head first, leaving in his wake the remains of the armour that had taken the hit.</p><p align="justify">“I thought I heard a little pest running around.“ The same voice. He could hear it clearly this time. Filled with mirth and cruelty. “But I didn’t expect it to be this small.”</p><p align="justify">Neville pushed himself off the ground and turned around, hatred filling his heart as he recognized the woman facing him.</p><p align="justify">“Lestrange.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh? Know enough to see you drew the short wand, do you?” Bellatrix’s predatory smile turned to a frown. “Can’t say the same I’m afraid. Then again, I didn’t expect Dumbledore to actually come to this dump.”</p><p align="justify">“So this was a trap?” Get her talking. Gain some time to breathe and think. Find an opening. “You killed hundreds of people to lure Dumbledore out of Hogwarts?”</p><p align="justify">“Aren’t we have a spirited little mouse? Getting angry over some Muggles? You might be fun to play with before I go look elsewhere, after all.”</p><p align="justify">Her wand was at the ready. He needed to distract her. He couldn’t let her strike first.</p><p align="justify">“You’re a monster. Always have been.” Neville got up, unlatching his helmet with his free hand. “And you need to be put down.” His helmet fell to the floor with a thud, revealing his face, twisted in rage, his hair sticking to his face with sweat. “I am Neville Longbottom. Son of Frank and Alice. This is where you die.”</p><p align="justify">She stood there for a moment, looking at him in shock until she roared with laughter.</p><p align="justify">“The Longbottom kid? Is that the best Dumbledore’s little club can spare nowadays?” Neville stood his ground, wand at the ready. Waiting. Watching. “Oh, this is going to be fun. I always regretted not being able to finish the job, you know? Too bad I couldn’t take care of the old crone myself.”</p><p align="justify">Neville’s grip on his father’s wand was strong enough that a small part of him feared it might snap. It did not matter, however, as the rest was too busy seeing red.</p><p align="justify">Red and purple.</p><p align="justify">“Accio, you bitch.”</p><p align="justify">Wooden debris engulfed in purple flames flew through the open door and toward Bellatrix’s back.</p><p align="justify">“Tsk, tsk, tsk.” With an unconcerned wave of her wand, Bellatrix sent the improvised projectiles crashing against a wall. “That’s the problem with blood traitor filth like your family. No sense of manners.”</p><p align="justify">Neville ran to the side, barely avoiding the barrage of curses that Bellatrix effortlessly rained down upon him. The wall behind him exploded, the bricks wrapping and twisting into spikes that threw themselves at him.</p><p align="justify">Neville slid to the floor, wand moving in a spiral pattern. “Arbor Pullula!” He ignored the feeling of the air displaced by the spikes as they flew above him and focused all his will on the wooden floor at Bellatrix’s feet.</p><p align="justify">Thick branches sprouted from the floor, constricting her lower half and pulling her down. He did not have time to rejoice, however. With a slash of her wand, Bellatrix summoned a streak of purple flames that burned away her restraints as it swept through the room.</p><p align="justify">Neville raised his suit’s shield in time to stop it from touching him, but the blue energy crackled and died in contact with the cursed fire.</p><p align="justify">“You know, I just had a brilliant idea.” Bellatrix stepped away from the burning branches, their wretched forms contorting in the flames as if sucking the very life out of them. “Once I’m done here, I’ll pay a visit to your dear Mum and Dad. Give them a taste of what their son went through for old-time sake. Crucio!”</p><p align="justify">With no time to think, Neville rolled to the side, ending up far too close form the flames consuming the wall for comfort.</p><p align="justify">At a disadvantage both by his position and Bellatrix’s momentum, Neville held his ground and faced her spell for spell. Time became a blur as they traded curses and jinxes, ravaging the apartment in their attempts to kill one another. Neither furniture nor dividing walls escaped their zeal, for what the flames did not burn, they blew up and transfigured into deadly traps.</p><p align="justify">Injured and exhausted, Neville was both mentally and physically spent and did not have much to show for it. Despite his relentless attempts, Bellatrix still stood strong, the mad grin on her face unperturbed by the pain he knew her injured leg must be causing her.</p><p align="justify">He was not strong enough.</p><p align="justify">And yet, this was something he would never accept. He had not trained so hard and thought of this day for so long to fail now. His family had suffered so much at her hand. He needed to avenge them. To be the one that finally put her down. To make them proud.</p><p align="justify">The ceiling came crashing down in a deluge of wood and flames, collapsing the floor under its weight and continuing its fall in the floor under them. Having jumped out of the way in time, Neville and Bellatrix now found themselves on opposite ends of a great chasm, burning debris raining down around them.</p><p align="justify">“Tsk.” Bellatrix clicked her tongue, a displeased scowl marring her previously joyful expression. “Out of time, it seems. We’ll have to pick this up another day.”</p><p align="justify">No! She could not get away. Not again.</p><p align="justify">“Flagrante!”</p><p align="justify">“Really?” Bellatrix batted away the curse with a sweep of her wand. “I do hope you learn some manners before we meet again. I prefer my toys to be house-broken.”</p><p align="justify">And with that, she was gone.</p><p align="justify">“No!” He raged, throwing a curse to the empty space where she had stood a moment ago. “Come back, you coward! Come back and die!”</p><p align="justify">Neville fell to the floor, his strength spent and his breath painful from taking in too much smoke.</p><p align="justify">And for what?</p><p align="justify">Nothing.</p><p align="justify">He did not have a single thing to show for his efforts. His parent’s tormentor lived to kill and torture another day.</p><p align="justify">How long until another chance presented itself? How many more would have to die until it all ended?</p><p align="justify">And what if she had decided to make good on her threat? To go to St Mungo and finish the job?</p><p align="justify">He could not let that happen.</p><p align="justify">He got up, wand in hand and ready to apparate away when a great crash echoed nearby as more of the building collapsed, followed by the frightened shrill of a girl from above.</p><p align="justify">There was still someone in the building.</p><p align="justify">Despite the flames, the smoke and the ground giving under their feet, someone had survived.</p><p align="justify">He froze.</p><p align="justify">He could not let her die.</p><p align="justify">And yet, staying would give Bellatrix time to exact her vengeance on his parents. No one at St Mungo’s would stand up for them. No one would risk the wrath of Bellatrix Lestrange for a couple of insane patients.</p><p align="justify">He could not let them die.</p><p align="justify">With every second of indecision, more of the building came down around him and Bellatrix took one more step toward his Mum and Dad.</p><p align="justify">Tears filled his eyes, evaporating before they could run down his cheeks as he tightened his grip on his wand.</p><p align="justify">His father’s wand.</p><p align="justify">The wand that had been passed down to him with a promise and a hope.</p><p align="justify">That he would honour their memory.</p><p align="justify">He could not let them down.</p><p align="justify">“Erigo Scalae!”</p><p align="justify">Bricks and planks all around him flew above the chasm, forming makeshift stairs in the air as he climbed them in haste, forcing his gaze upward as he dared not look down.</p><p align="justify">He heard the cries again, more urgent.</p><p align="justify">He did not have time to search.</p><p align="justify">Once on the floor above, he tore through the burning wall with a wave of his wand, revealing a dining room where a small girl was bundled up under a table. She held her head in her hands as she cried, her eyes shut so she would not see the charred hands of her parents coming out of the debris burying the door.</p><p align="justify">The walls and ceilings groaned, straining under their own weight now that the wall could not support it.</p><p align="justify">Neville threw himself through the opening, crying out as the flames licked his legs. He fell on the floor near the table, the girl now looking at him.</p><p align="justify">“Hey there.” His throat was sore, every word painful. “I know it’s scary, but I need you to be brave, ok?” His legs refused to hold his weight, folding under him as he dragged himself to the girl, holding out a hand. “Just... Just take my hand and we’ll get out of here.”</p><p align="justify">She stayed there, frozen, looking at him with eyes full of fear, her mouth quivering.</p><p align="justify">The ceiling gave out, coming down upon them.</p><p align="justify">The girl threw herself at him and Neville twisted in place, apparating them both away.</p><p align="justify">They reappeared outside, a couple of meters above the road. Neville held the girl tightly against his chest as they fell, the building collapsing in front of them. His head hit the asphalt violently, loosening his grip on the child who rolled over to the side.</p><p align="justify">The pain in his head and legs flooded his mind, blanking out any coherent thoughts as dark spots filled his vision. Each breath made his burned throat flare with pain and the beating of his heart was the only sound filling his ears.</p><p align="justify">Maybe it was the concussion, or maybe his mind was trying to ease his end, but despite the agony enveloping his entire body, Neville had never felt so happy. And so he remained, content to lay on the ground, watching the plumes of smoke rise into the sky, feeling his bruised ribs with each laboured breath.</p><p align="justify">And as the pain recessed and his mind cleared, a great shadow came upon the world.</p><p align="justify">“What in the hell?”</p><hr /><p align="justify">The first breath Ginny took when she came to was filled with blood and bile, quickly turning it into a painful cough that brought the agony of her entire body to the attention of her addled mind.</p><p align="justify">Laid out on her back amongst piles of flaming debris, her lower body was pinned down under the remains of one of the buildings bordering the tracks. She tried to push it off, only to let go almost immediately with a strangled cry as pain flared in her right arm. If it was not broken, it was a close thing.</p><p align="justify">Trapped as she was, she gritted her teeth and looked around, searching the burning remains of the buildings and the derailed train surrounding her in search of her wand.</p><p align="justify">And that’s when she saw him.</p><p align="justify">Percy’s mangled body was hanging limply from the train car embedded in a wall, blood pouring out of his wide, unseeing eyes.</p><p align="justify">She cried out again, tears streaming down her cheeks as she tried to extirpate herself, to push off the rubbles pinning her down and reach him. To hold him and tell him everything that, in her anger, she had kept to herself. To do all she could to bring him back.</p><p align="justify">To do something. Anything at all.</p><p align="justify">Because she could not bear the thought of losing him. Of not having been strong enough.</p><p align="justify">Not again.</p><p align="justify">And yet, despite her struggle, she remained trapped under the metal and concrete until what little strength she had was spent.</p><p align="justify">Through the grief, the guilt and the pain plaguing her mind, she knew that she would soon join him if she did not do something. Her survival was already a miracle granted by the reinforced parts of her now ruined armour, but even that had its limits.</p><p align="justify">With her good arm, she reached for the communication stone embedded in the twisted remains of her armour. One tap on the right runes engraved on its sides was all it would take to call for help.</p><p align="justify">And yet, she stayed her hand just above it when the light of midday died in the skies above.</p><p align="justify">Beyond the ruins and the smoke, the sun disappeared and calm blue darkened to black as a starless night fell in mere moments. Out of the darkness, the Moon took its place in the sky, looming upon Britain in its full glory.</p><p align="justify">For despair could be found on the brightest of days, if one was willing to extinguish the light.</p>

  <p align="justify">
  <span>“How about the mountains?“</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No.” Remus did not even look at him, preferring to vanish the month's worth of dust covering everything in the cottage instead.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Alright... The beach, then!” Sirius was rocking back on the back legs of his chairs, twirling his wand between his fingers as he watched him work. “Far from any town. There’s plenty of those around.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Oh yes, and I’d wake up the next morning to find out you drowned trying to plunge off a cliff.” Remus took out a few logs, carefully placing them in the hearth. “I think I’ll pass.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You know, you’re no fun when you’re like this.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Sirius waved his wand nonchalantly, lighting up the fireplace, and put it back in the breast pocket of his jacket. The leathery material it was made of felt strange against his skin, rough in places and far too smooth in others, but he’d be damned if he didn’t wear the first thing his godson had gifted him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t really like myself right now, either.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And for good reasons. His face was pale and tired, the side effects of Wolfsbane already manifesting, despite the early hour of the afternoon. And as the hour passed, he would grow weaker still, the draught sapping his strength until the moon rose and the wolf would be weak enough for Remus to retain his mind after the transformation.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yeah, I know.” Sirius sighed. “All I’m saying is that we don’t have to lock ourselves in here every time. I get enough of that the rest of the year already.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m not going to take any risk, Sirius. You know what happened last time.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“That doesn’t count. You didn’t have the potion then.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“And I almost killed you and the others. It only needs to happen once...”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We’ve been doing this since we were kids. Hell, you even managed on your own for a decade. You need to-"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>A series of sharp cracks echoed outside the house. A sound so distinctive any wizard worth their salt would be hard-pressed to misinterpret it.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Sirius brought his chair back to the ground, looking at the door with a frown.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Waiting for someone?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No. No one is even supposed to know we’re here.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>They exchanged a worried look before Sirius approached a window, pushing the thick curtains aside ever so slightly with the tip of his wand. The forest outside was plunged in darkness far too deep for this time of day, even with the century-old trees looming overhead.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t see—wait, something moved.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>They shivered as something cold and heavy fell upon them, as if someone had draped a blanket that had been left in the snow around them.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Someone raised wards around the house.” Careful not to pass in front of it, Remus took position on the other side of the window. “We can’t leave.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Of course we can’t...” Sirius muttered between clenched teeth. Life had never given them a break and it was not about to start now.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You’re surrounded, Remus.” An amplified voice easily passed through the thin glass, giving them pause as the all too familiar squeaky tone delivered its ultimatum. “It’s time to come out now.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Sirius’ hand clenched in a tight fist around his wand and only Remus’ firm grasp on his shoulder stopped him from rushing outside.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m not welcoming visitors today, Peter. How about you go back to whatever hole you crawled from before somebody gets hurt?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t want to fight. I just want to talk. To give you a chance to get on the winning side.“</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“And grovel at the feet of James and Lily’s killer, like you?” Sirius spat. “You’ve always been a joke Peter, but even I didn’t expect your punchline to be this bad.“</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You should muzzle your dog, Remus, or his bark will get him killed.” Outside, dark silhouettes moved around the trees, too quickly for either of them to sling a curse at or find an opening to flee. “Dumbledore has already lost. Do you really want to fight a lost cause to restore a system that treated you like vermin?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“When the alternative is working with insane murderers and psychopaths like you and Greyback... I think I’m just fine where I am, thank you.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Is that really what you think? We’re the ones fighting for a better world. One where we won’t have to hide from Muggles. Where you can walk down the street without people hiding their children from you. Think about-"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>A glimmer of red was their only warning, one that Remus put to good use as he summoned the table against the window before it exploded, shielding them from the worst of it.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Guess his new friends are as tired of hearing his crap as we are.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Curses, glass and stones filled the air, the Death Eaters holding nothing back and the last two marauders reciprocating in turn. Sirius stood amidst the chaos, slinging spell after spell with vicious precision, smiling ruefully when he heard the cries of pain of one of their “guests” as they fell.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Without any warning, Remus kicked over a large armchair and dove for cover behind it, dragging Sirius down with him. Not a second later, the far wall of the house exploded, covering them in stone dust.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What the hell are you doing!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You almost caught that with your face!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t care!” Sirius barked back right to his face, enraged. “He’s right here! I had him!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You won’t have anything if you keep...” A silver gleam reflected in Remus’ eyes and the colour drained from his face. “It can’t-"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>His incredulity died as he doubled over, shouting in pain as he pushed Sirius away and out in the open.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Swearing, Sirius hastily put up a shield. It came too late, however, to stop a curse from hitting his left shoulder, scorching his jacket yet leaving him with little more than a dull pain through his arm. He did not have the time to ponder the strange happening, however, as Remus was writhing in pain at his feet, clawing at his clothes as his bones snapped and rearranged themselves in an all too familiar sight.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Sirius dared a look over his shoulder, already knowing the impossible sight that awaited him. The pale moon, shining in its full and horrifying glory through the canopy and the missing wall, half a day before its time.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Too soon. Far too soon.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Rumours of the transformation had spread to the Death Eaters as well, the curses letting place to panicked shouts. Seizing the opportunity, Sirius sliced the air with his wand and the tree from which one of the shouts came from exploded, reigniting the hostilities.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Not keen on waiting for his friend to finish turning, Sirius threw himself out a window, the soft paws of a dog landing on the mossy ground.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He ran through the trees, biting and clawing at the Death Eaters he found, echoing the gruesome spectacle taking place in front of the house.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Avada-"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Argh!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>His maw full of blood, Padfoot circled back to the house, limping and leaving behind him the body of the last Death Eater hiding in the forest.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>In front of the ruined house, Moony had been forced to the ground and Peter was wrestling the wand of one of his henchmen away from him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I told you I want him alive!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Idiot! You’re gonna get us killed!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Always happy to help, Padfoot leapt at one of the Death Eaters and bloodied his maw once more. The man let go of his last breath, though not before a Bludgeoning hex sent the dog flying.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Damn beasts.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Tossed around like a rag doll among the twigs and stones, Sirius collapsed face down into the moss, his very much human ribs burning painfully. To add insult to injury, the grumbling clouds above finally broke and heavy drops fell upon the forest.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Remus. It’s me, Peter, remember?” In the distance, Sirius could hear the loathful plea. Trying to drown them in his own shout only produced a growl as pain flared in his lungs. “You wouldn’t harm your friend, would you?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>That little rat.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He dared?</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>After all he had done?</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Fuelled by a rage that dulled his pain, Sirius pushed himself off the ground and onto his elbows, grasping for his wand.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Please, Remus. I-I just want to help-"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>With a feral howl, the Werewolf leapt at Peter, maw open wide and fanged bared.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Green light illuminated the forest and time slowed to a crawl as Sirius saw the last of his friends fall to the ground, like a grotesque puppet whose strings had been cut. There was no trace of the humble and soft-spoken man to be found here, only a rabid beast being put down.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He wanted to shout, to curse at the world and the rat that had ruined his life and all that he loved. No word, however, managed to pass his lips.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He needed to get up. To get to Remus and strangle that damned rat with his own hands. Yet his broken ribs kept him down and forced him to crawl through the mud.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Tearing his gaze from Remus’ remains, Sirius searched for Peter. Nowhere did he find the gloating and satisfaction he had expected, however, for the traitor’s face was twisted in a grimace of shock and despair.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What have you done!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I killed a monster.” The last henchman spat, turning his wand toward Peter. “And you better pray you’re not next for dragging us in this mess in the first pl-"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The threat died on his lips, however. With a scream, barely an incantation, the forest was lit up by emerald light for the second time in as many minutes. As the body of his companion hit the ground, so did Peter’s wand escape his grasp and his legs gave under him, leaving him to fall to his knees before Remus.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He remained there, slumped over the corpse of one who had once called him friend, the silence only broken by the rain hammering his hunched back.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Peter. Peter!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Pettigrew barely heard the shouts through the rain, broken up by coughs as they were. Picking up his wand, he turned to see Sirius, dragging himself through the mud to reach him, wand in hand. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span> “You did this! You did all of this!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Startled, Peter shrank, disappearing from view.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“James ... Lily ... Remus .. You killed them all!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Sirius peered through the rain, searching for the cowardly rodent until his wand was pried from his hand. A heavy weight came down on his back and he felt the distinctive shape of a wand being pressed against his throat.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“This ... This wasn’t my fault.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You brought this on yourself. On all of us!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No!” The wand dug deeper into his throat, trembling. “I never wanted things to come to this! I just... I only wanted to talk to him.” Peter’s voice was hoarse and broken up by sobs. His tears disappearing in the rain. “To explain everything. T-to make him understand-”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What? That you’re a monster? That you betrayed us? I think you clued him in on that a long time ago.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I-I needed him to see. I never wanted James and Lily to die. But the Dark Lord ... He’s the only one fighting for us. The only one willing to do what we need to build a world where we wouldn’t have to hide! A world where Remus wouldn’t be treated like a monster.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You actually believed that crap?” Sirius couldn’t stop himself. The rueful laugh set his lungs and broken ribs on fire and ended in a coughing fit, but he could not contain it. “You’re insane!.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I just ... I wanted my friend back.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You killed James and Remus the moment you joined Voldemort. You’re on the same side as the man who bit Remus as a child, Peter!” Sirius roared, struggling against Peter’s hold despite the wand digging painfully into his throat. “You came to “talk” accompanied by Death Eaters! Whatever crap you tell yourself to justify this, you made your choice fifteen years ago.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Shut up!” Peter pushed him back down into the mud. “You have no idea what I had to do. What I had to endure while you were fooling around. Remus was the only one that even-”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Boohoo, sad little Peter had a tough time growing up. Join the club, arsehole!” Sirius spat. “None of us decided to help a dark lord and kill the others because of it! And speaking of which, it looks like you’ll get to finish the set tonight.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Peter’s hold weakened, allowing him to push him off and free himself. He turned on his back, arms out as he glared at Peter, who towered above him with his wand aimed at his chest.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Come on. Do it!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘’I ... I...”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Do it! You already took everything from me!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I can’t...”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Do it!” Sirius screamed his throat raw.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No!” The silver hand came down, no spell coming out of the wand it held. Peter looked down at the last of his friends, his eyes full of pain and his voice broken. “You need to go. Just ... Just leave the country, Sirius. And never look back.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And with that, he turned and walked away, leaving Sirius behind in the blood-stained mud.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Gritting his teeth through the pain, Sirius pushed himself off the ground.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Each breath set his lungs on fire, but he did not care.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You don’t get to walk away. Not again!“</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Sirius threw himself at Peter, his form blurring in the air before Padfoot bit his arm, forcing him to drop his wand.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He changed back, pinning him down as he had been a moment ago.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He would not be a coward, however.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Not like Peter.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Never like him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Beating down Peter’s attempts at shaking him off, Sirius grasped a fistful of hair and a nearby rock.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>For James.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>For Remus.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>With a cry of rage and sorrow, Sirius brought the rock down again and again.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Until the struggle stopped.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Until the pleading stopped.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Until he was the last Marauder.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Finally.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>After sixteen years, the traitor was dead and his friends had been avenged.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The moment he had been living for this whole time had passed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And yet, sitting alone under the rain and surrounded by the bodies of friends and foes alike, he could not feel the joy he had expected.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>As he dragged himself to Remus and looked into the yellow eyes of his last friend, he could find no comfort in his presence.</span>
</p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <span>In the distance, the Rochester Cathedral rang the first hour of the afternoon as the full moon shone above. A starless night had fallen over the country, bringing with it a chilling wind.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And yet, despite it all, the Muggles went on with their lives. The only difference was the unusually high number of people who had turned in their radios and tellies to hear experts fail to explain the strange sky and the catastrophes happening across in the country.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>All of them blissfully unaware of the beasts lurking in their streets.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>On the other shore of the Medway, a beast bared its fangs as it jumped onto the next roof, ready to pierce skin and muscles to satisfy the whispers of its curse.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It had been so long since it had indulged them, their sweet promises coming to it every night despite the lack of prey. Banished to the forests, far from Wizards and Muggles alike, condemned to live in shame of who it was.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>But no more.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>They had tried to trap them, to herd them like cattle, far away from their prey. They had underestimated them, thinking they faced mindless beasts. And now they would pay the price.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The pack had split, chasing the three little wizards through the streets after their plan had failed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It could hear her run, her panicked steps echoing in the street below as she vainly tried to escape.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It could smell the metal and magic she had encased herself in, foolishly thinking it would protect her from its fangs and claws.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He could see her waver, her strength waning, allowing the pack to close in on her, prowling on the roofs and alleys.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>They ran and ran, never stopping, never resting.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Never standing a chance.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The beast leapt from the roof, tackling its prey. The girl cried out, flailing around as she futilely tried to push the mass of muscles and fur off of her.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Jaws open wide, it plunged for the bite ... Only for its fangs to rip on the metal hidden under the clothes. Growling in rage, the beast bit and clawed at the prey repeatedly, scratching the armour yet never finding purchase in the flesh.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Something hit the beast in the back, throwing it off the girl with a howl of pain echoed by the others as a group of witches and wizards descended upon them.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Standing tall among them, a woman with faded red hair and a battered Auror cloak looked at the beast with cold anger shining in her eyes.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>This was a face well-known by the beast, one of the main culprits responsible for the tightening laws against its kind. The very laws that had turned them into outcasts, living from scraps in the darkest reaches of the magical world.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And with a flash of red, her name was the last thing the Werewolf ever knew.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The iron fist of the Ministry.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Amelia Bones.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Spread out and clean up. There are bound to be more lurking around.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The last Werewolf fell on the pavement, its burning fur spreading a foul smell that would have turned the stomach of anyone. Fortunately for Amelia, her Aurors were not anyone. They were the best of the best, trained by veterans and kept sharps even when the rest of the country had been content to leave the war behind after He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had disappeared.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Already, Robards was barking orders and the dozen men they had brought busied themselves, masking any trace of the Werewolves’ presence and apparating up to the roofs to locate the rest of the pack.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Among the bustling street and Aurors running left and right, Amelia stood still, towering over the armoured girl with her arms crossed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“And what am I going to do with you?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>She could not be older than Susan and here she was, trembling like a leaf as she picked herself up, the smooth metal helmet doing nothing to hide the shock and fear that grasped at her heart.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Despite her shock and strange state of dress, the wand lying on the ground left no doubt as to her nature. Still, the colourful armoured suit gave her pause, chiefly since it matched the description that one of Dumbledore’s men had given her after that bombing at the Ministry...</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You ... You can’t be here...” With a trembling hand, the girl grabbed her wand and raised it toward Amelia. “I don’t care what sick game you’re playing, but-”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m not playing any game. Which is why I would like to know who you are and what you are doing here.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“A-Amelia Bones is dead! You can’t be her.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“A necessary subterfuge. One that was not hard to orchestrate when Death Eaters were killing officials left and right.” With a flick of her wrist, the girl’s wand jumped from her hand and into Amelia’s. “Yet it hardly matters now. The only reason you are still alive is the fact the werewolves were after you.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Unarmed, the girl crawled backwards, frantically looking at the bodies surrounding them, the helmet hiding her face doing nothing to hide her distress.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Was she unused to death? Sympathizing with the enemy? Or maybe both?</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You ... You killed them all ... How could you do this?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“My men and I saved your life and that of countless Muggles by putting down a group of dark creatures.” Sympathizing with the enemy then. Disappointing. “You’re welcome.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Put them down?” She got up, her unsteady legs supported by righteous indignation. “These are people you’re talking about!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Right now they are dangerous beasts. Beasts that swore allegiance to a madman and are now threatening innocents.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“They don’t have a choice! You and the rest of the Ministry practically pushed them into his arms with all the laws you passed!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Enough. I’m not here to debate politics. And are you really going to defend them when you almost got eaten by one of them not two minutes ago?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I wasn’t in any danger. My suit protected me.” </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yes, I’m sure it did.” Despite the sarcasm dripping from her words, Amelia could not ignore the mere scratches crisscrossing the armour, when her own reinforced trenchcoat would have been torn to shreds. How did a child get their hand on something like this? ”Now are you going to take that thing off and tell me who you are or do I have to do it myself?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The girl looked at her defiantly for a moment, fists clenched and ready to pounce. A stance Amelia had seen many times before in petty criminals before they tried their luck with an escape. None succeeded.</span>
  <span><br />
</span>
  <span><br />
</span>
  <span>“Fine.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Letting out a shaky breath, she relaxed her stance yet she kept her chin high, challenging, as she took off her helmet, freeing two large braids of copper hair and an all too familiar face.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Susan?” Amelia whispered, unable to believe her eyes.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“So you remember who I am?” Susan glared at her aunt, who could only stare back in shock. “Seven months.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What...”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I thought you dead for seven months. Not one note. Not one letter.” With her helmet under her arm, Susan closed the distance between them and brought an accusatory finger right to her aunt’s face. “And don’t you give me that confidential crap. You couldn’t even be bothered to send a message through Dumbledore.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m leading a war!” Amelia snapped, pushing her hand away. “I can’t take the time to coddle you when the entire country goes up in flames! What are you even doing here!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What do you think?” Susan gestures at what few Werewolves the Aurors had yet to cremate. “This would all be other already if you hadn’t come in and mucked up our plan.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Your plan?” Amelia could not believe what she was hearing. How could her sweet, clever niece do something so foolish? “A Werewolf was mauling you! We’re getting you back to Hogwarts right this instant."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m not going anywhere. Not while the people here need help.” Susan scowled at her, her eyes darting to the fires burning on the side of the street, bringing with them the stench of charred flesh. “Not if that’s your solution.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You’re a child, Susan! This isn’t-”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>A great howl rose in the night, soon echoed by more coming from every corner of the city.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“They found us.” Amelia peered through the darkness down the street, searching for any sign of the beasts as her men closed ranks around her. “Tremaine, take her and-"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taking advantage of the distraction, Susan snatched her wand from Amelia’s grasp, her helmet already back in place.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You-”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m sorry. But we have to be better than this,” As she stepped back, Susan disappeared into the night. “Or it will never end.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Susan!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“M’am, they’re coming.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Cursing under her breath, Amelia turned away from the empty air where her only family had disappeared and walked up to Robards.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I want men in those buildings and on the roofs, covering the alleys. Use the cars to slow their advance and keep them at bay. If they reach us, we apparate to the roofs. We can’t let them get too close.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>A nod from Robards and the men and women who had pledged their lives to save this country spear to form a defensive position.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Far too soon, the howls died down, the sound of claws scraping the asphalt and threatening growls filled the street. They waited, anxious for the charge of the beasts they could hear move just out of their sight. Playing with them. Instilling a sense of dread as their numbers grew with each passing moment ... Until a man, dressed in the same they were walked up the street, smirking and flanked by two of the beasts.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“When I heard that a bunch of Aurors were hunting down our men, I could hardly believe it. And yet, here we are.” The man stopped, close enough from their makeshift barricade to be seen yet far enough to avoid any spell they could throw at him. “When you disappeared, I thought you had wisened up and left the country.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“And leave it to punks like you?” One of the Aurors on the barricade shouted. “Not a chance.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“So crude.” The man clicked his tongue loudly, making a show of shaking his head. “You are talking to an official representative of the Ministry. But I guess basic manners are beyond the simple minds of the old guard.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Licking Malfoy’s boots and wearing this coat doesn’t make you an representant of the law, Selwyn,” Amelia called out impatiently. “Not when you failed the exam as many times as you did.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Is that Amelia Bones I hear?” Brayden Selwyn asked, joy and disbelief fuelling his voice. “It seems the rumours of your death were greatly exaggerated.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“And yours will be a certitude. So how about you drop the crap and tell us what you want already?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Well, I was going to offer your men a chance to rejoin the office and to serve the rightful administration, but I think I have a better idea now. Your corpse will make for a most satisfying gift to the Dark Lord. Boys? It’s dinner time.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Surging from the shadows, dozens of Werewolves charged from every direction. With reflexes honed by decades of experience, the Aurors started casting as soon as the first tufts of fur appeared, killing beasts left and right yet barely thinning the horde. Already they climbed the barricade, the metal tearing under their paws like paper.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Retreat! Get to the-”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>A shrill sound echoed through the street, stopping the Werewolves in their tracks and bolts of lightning burst out from the shadows, arcing from Aurors to werewolves.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Her ears ringing and dark spots encroaching upon her vision, Amelia bit her tongue to remain conscious as everyone around her collapsed to the ground.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>In the distance, Selwyn apparated away, seconds before the light of a spell flew right where he had been standing.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m sorry Auntie.” Amelia turned around to find Susan, standing among the unconscious Aurors with two other armoured silhouettes. “But I can’t let anyone else die.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Susan...”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Stupefix.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The spell hit Amelia and she collapsed, joining the rest of the combatants in a restless sleep.</span>
</p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <span>The cracking sound of Bellatrix apparating in the lobby of her brother-in-law’s manor was drowned by the agonizing cries coming from the lounge. Unsurprising, really. Whatever poor sod had thought they could bring the Dark Lord bad news when the entire country was feeling his ire should have known better.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Leaning on the wall for support, Bellatrix limped toward the lounge, hoping Severus had returned from his raid already. The man was a disgrace, but even she had to admit his knowledge of healing was the best they had and she would be damned if she let one of the new recruits touch her.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Oh, how she missed Rookwook. Why did he have to go and get himself killed by old Mad-Eye? That’s what you get by keeping your nose in dusty tomes instead of training.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>She turned the corner and entered the lobby as the Dark Lord put an end to his spell, the cries of one of the new blood turning into whimpered pleas.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Please. Please my lord I didn’t-I didn’t-”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You failed me, Selwyn. Once again.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“But my lord-”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Crucio.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>With the Dark Lord otherwise occupied, Bellatrix ignored the sorry spectacle and hobbled over to the lounging chair where Cissy was cringing at the mess ruining her precious carpet. Standing next to her, Lucius was twirling his wand in his hands, raising an eyebrow at her as she approached yet not saying a word.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The little prick.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And speaking of pricks, while a few mooks were in the room, enjoying the scene, Severus was nowhere to be found. It figures he would still be out playing with Muggles instead of doing his job.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Well, at least she would have some entertainment while waiting for his return.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I sent you with the largest pack of Werewolves in Western Europe and you dare return empty-handed?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Nagini, coiled at the Dark Lord’s feet, hissed in disapproval, her tongue humming the fear and pain of Selwyn’s cries.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Do you have any idea how costly the ritual that allowed them to turn during the day was? How long it took Greyback to build up his numbers? Only for you to waste it all in a matter of hours. And you dare to come back empty-handed?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>As the useless sack of blood and bile continued to writhe on the floor, Bellatrix stretched her leg and winced at the sight of her tight. The Longbottom kid might have gotten a lucky shot, but she had been lucky herself not to lose her leg there and then.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“As if Dumbledore’s cowardice was not enough, your incompetence is costing me more than I can afford to lose.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The curse ceased once again and Selwyn rolled to the side, catching his breath with a throat he had screamed raw.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Please ... Please, my Lord. I couldn’t ... It was them. Those who attacked the Ministry! And the Aurors ... We didn’t stand a chance! If you allow me to go back with a dozen men-”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Crucio.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Ever merciful, the Dark Lord only subjected the insolent whelp to the curse for a few seconds before freeing him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I tire of these useless servants you found, Lucius.” The man straightened as the attention of the Dark Lord fell upon him. ”There will be changes in the Ministry. As for this one...”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Selwyn tried to push himself up, to look the Dark Lord in the eyes and plead, but his broken voice failed him and he collapsed once more, staining the carpet with his blood, to Cissy’s consternation.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Nagini. Kill him.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Cissy, ever the fragile little thing, turned away her gaze as the snake rose from the floor, and her husband barely hid his distaste behind the back of his hand.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Nagini leapt at the pathetic worm, maw open wide and ready to sink her fangs into her early diner...</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And hissed in agony as a gleaming silver blade pierced her abdomen.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“This hurts a lot less when the snake is smaller.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Despite her injured leg, Bellatrix jumped from her seat, brandishing her wand. A second later, the mooks followed her lead and Lucius stepped in front of Cissy while the Dark Lord remained frozen in shock.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The blade came down, throwing the snake’s corpse at the feet of the intruders.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You wished to draw me out, Tom. Well, here I am.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Dumbledore and Potter stood in the middle of their headquarters, ruining Cissy’s precious carpet with the blood of the Dark Lord’s pet.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The Dark lord roared with rage, all pageantry forgotten as he sent a cloud of living shadows at the interlopers, plunging the room into chaos.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Dumbledore deflected the spell into the group of Death Eaters by the far walls, and their flesh melted off their bones as he animated the carpet to attack the Dark Lord.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>When Bellatrix tried to help her master, Dumbledore sent her curse back at the Dark Lord and banished her into the wall. She slid to the ground, stunned and out of breath, while the two Titans exchanged spell after spell, destroying the house around them.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Through the chaos, she spotted Lucius, who grabbed a panicked Cissy and apparated away.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>At least Blondie was good for something.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>On the other side of the fight, Potter plunged his blade deep into the torso of Crabbe, who had escaped the fate of his companions. The boy freed his blade and sent a spell toward the Dark Lord, who blocked it with ease. This distraction came at a cost, however, and Dumbledore’s curse struck true, tearing the flesh off the Dark Lord’s arm.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You little brat!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Pushing herself off the floor and standing precariously on her injured leg, Bellatrix sent a volley of cruses at Potter, turning the duel into a deadly cross-fire when he retaliated.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The four of them were so taken by their fight that none noticed Selwyn as he bragged himself out of harm’s way. With his body barely responding to his will and his mind fractured, the man held on to a single hope, the one thought that had kept him from going mad under the torture of the master he had admired.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Revenge.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Revenge upon those who had caused his downfall.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Revenge upon those who had looked upon his torture with scorn and laughed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“May you all burn.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>With this singular intent and his very life fuelling the spell, Brayden Selwyn whispered his last words and exploded in a flurry of dark flames.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taking the shape of a thousand creatures, the flames spread in an instant, consuming everything in their path, starting with the body of their caster.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“My lord!” Bellatrix shouted in alarm, the flames already devouring the furniture around her. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Through them, she could see the Dark Lord to which she had dedicated her life and soul ignore her plea, his scornful glare reserved for Dumbledore before he apparated away.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“My lord?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Harry!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Dumbledore braved the flames to take hold of Potter with a blacked hand and spun to disapparate, taking the boy with him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Yet not before a spell flew across the room, hitting the stunned Bellatrix and throwing her into the flames.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Unhampered, the inferno consumed all in its path, burning away centuries of history and dark artefacts with the fervour of a dying man.</span>
</p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <span>Neville gagged as the sludge oozed down his throat, repressing the cough that threatened to throw out the offending potion. Sitting next to him, Susan put down the empty vial with the others and carefully helped him lie back on the bed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Easy now. It won’t work if you don’t let it settle.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Easier said than done.” The gravelly voice coming out of Neville’s mouth sounded as strange to him as his burned throat felt. “This stuff is disgusting.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“It sure isn’t Butterbeer, but it’s either that or losing your vocal cords. And even with it, they might still not fully recover. You’re lucky they didn’t burn away completely after the mess these fumes did to your larynx.” Unable to bear her scowl, Neville averted his eyes. “What were you thinking, going in there without your helmet?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Apparently I wasn’t...”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Neville winced as he swallowed the last gulp of the potion, prompting another coughing fit. Ending up in the station’s infirmary with a burnt throat and lungs was not exactly what he had envisioned when he had thought of joining the fight.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And he was not the only one either.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>As the day had come to a close, the moon still hanging high above Britain, both sides had fallen back to lick their wounds, leaving the muggle authorities to deal with the consequences of the Death Eaters’ rampage. The infirmary was packed, with new patients coming in as they returned from Earth, bringing with them news of what had transpired that day.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>On the opposite side of the room from Neville’s bed, Marietta was at her mother’s bedside, holding her hand tightly as they whispered to each other. Next to them, Seamus was helping Healer </span>
  <span>Swansforth </span>
  <span>set Parvati on a bed and remove her armour. The left part of her face was caked in blood and most of her hair was missing, but Neville could still see her chest rise and fall with every breath she took.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Rare were those who had returned unarmed from the battle, yet their wounds had saved many lives. From the people Neville and his team had pulled out of the flames to the entire town Terry and his group had protected from a host of Dementors. After today, the tales of their exploits were etched into their bodies, uniting them in the blood they had shed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And with every new arrival who did not bring news of an attack on St Mungo’s, the fear coiled around Neville’s heart loosened its grip.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I had ... It was her, you know? Bellatrix.” Susan froze when she heard the name. She knew, of course. Neville had told her himself months ago, while they still grieved the loss of their families in the dark corners of the ship. “When I saw her ... I lost my cool. I didn’t care about the flames or the people trapped in the building. I just wanted to kill her. I needed to.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Nev...”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I tried. I really tried. I gave everything I had and she danced circles around me.” His trembling hands grasped the bedsheets tightly as if it was the only thing that kept him grounded. “And when she left, I could have gone after her. But I ... I...”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Susan put a hand on his own, dousing the flaring embers of his rage as he released his grip.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I didn’t. I let her get away.” The cold sensation of the potion was spreading through his throat, easing the pain and freeing his tongue. “My one chance and I let it slip away.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Nev.” Susan cupped his wet cheek with a hand, gently raising his head. “Look at me.” She turned his hand around, interlacing her fingers with his own. “You did everything you could. More than that, you saved the lives of others.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“But I-”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No buts.” She stopped him, wiping away his tears with her thumb before taking his hand between hers. “You made the right choice. Going after her wouldn’t have brought your grandmother back or healed your parents.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No. It wouldn’t. But at least I would have made sure she would never do something like that again.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We’ll stop her. We’ll stop them all. But not by becoming as callous as them and sacrificing innocents. It’s not what your parents would have wanted.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>For a moment, they remained silent, drawing comfort from each other’s presence. Until Susan looked away, her gaze lost in the distance. When she spoke again, her voice was barely more than a whisper, laced with regret.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You know ... Before my aunt came in and killed those Werewolves to save me... We were going to kill them all ourselves.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You could never do something like that.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I could. I wanted to. Merlin I wanted to.” She let go of his hand and started wringing them in her lap. “They were the enemy. The monsters who had taken my parents and my aunt. Had she arrived a few minutes later, we would have assembled all of the werewolves in one place and burned them to a crisp.” She stopped abruptly and took a deep breath, steadying herself and chasing the anguish from her voice. “Yet when I saw her, completely indifferent as she stood in a street filled with dead bodies ... It was like a vision of the future. Of what I could become if I stayed on that path.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“And yet,” Neville reached out and held her hand. “You didn’t do it.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No. I didn’t.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“It’s like you said. You saved their lives. Hell, you even saved the enemy. Who else would have done that? They’re in prison, but they’re alive and it’s thanks to you.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“It’s all so stupid...” She sighed, her shoulder dropping as the tension let her. “We’re tearing each other apart over something that doesn’t even matter. Who cares if someone’s parents had magic? We need to stop. It all needs to stop.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Well, that’s why we fight. Sure, fighting isn’t the best, but they’re not really leaving us another choice.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>On the other side of the room, the door slid open and Tracey Davis—from the recovery team—floated the unconscious body of Ginny Weasley to a bed. Whatever had happened to her had not been pretty, leaving her a mangled mess of flesh and metal, her chest barely moving when she breathed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Susan got up, steeling herself by giving one last squeeze to his hand as Healer </span>
  <span>Swansforth rushed to Ginny’s side, calling for help.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You gonna be ok?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yeah...” Neville wiped away the last tears marring his cheeks and looked up at her, smiling. “Yeah, I will. Go save some lives.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="justify">While the sun set on the rest of Europe, the moon already glistened with an eerie glow in the skies above Hogwarts. Another day might have seen students playing and laughing in the corridors or enjoying the last rays of the sun on the grounds. Tonight, however, they gathered in the common rooms, holding each other close around the wireless, hoping they would not hear the name of their hometown. House Elves came and went, serving a simple yet filling dinner, warming hearts and stomachs while the Professors stood vigil on the edge of the grounds.</p><p align="justify">And high above it all, two souls sat in a well-worn tower, tired and singed yet alive and triumphant.</p><p align="justify">They had tended to the wounds left behind by their short yet intense battle, content in the knowledge that their hunt had come to an end.</p><p align="justify">No good thing could last forever, unfortunately, and patronuses soon appeared in droves, bringing news of the front. Despite the heroic efforts of hundreds of souls, the toll Voldemort had exacted for their victory was a terrible one. The unprepared Muggle and Magical communities had been decimated. Entire villages had been razed on the bloodiest day in centuries for the British people.</p><p align="justify">“It’s not over.”</p><p align="justify">“I fear not. Voldemort will not be satisfied with this outcome. Already he is rallying his forces, preparing for another strike.”</p><p align="justify">“He’ll come here. With the other Hocruxes gone, he’ll want to secure the diadem.”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore nodded gravely, his withered hand hidden under the desk as the other caressed Fawkes’ thin feathers. Unperturbed by the sombre mood, the youthful Phoenix demanded Dumbledore’s attention by hitting his arm with his head if he did not receive what he craved.</p><p align="justify">“His reluctance to face me and the safety of his followers’ children will not weigh much against his desperation. Which is why we need to take the initiative. We will draw him out far from here and finish what we couldn’t before he can put the students in danger.”</p><p align="justify">The antics of his feathered friend easing his tired features, Dumbledore patted him one last time before pulling a chilli pepper from a hidden drawer and throwing it toward the perch. Fawkes took flight and caught it in midair, settling down on the perch to savour his treat.</p><p align="justify">“Though it seems some of them were not content on staying safe behind our walls.” Dumbledore stared pointedly at Harry from above his half-moon spectacles. “I feel I have been tolerant enough until now, but this was reckless, Harry. Has the fate of young Macmillan taught you nothing?”</p><p align="justify">A year ago, Harry might have squirmed in guilt under the headmaster’s gaze. He would have feared the disapproval and sought to make amends by apologizing in every way possible.</p><p align="justify">Today though...</p><p align="justify">“I made the mistake of keeping them away once. To try and solve everything myself while keeping them away from danger.” Harry shook his head, regretting his past foolishness. “It wasn’t my choice to make. And it’s not yours either. They know what they risk by going out there, but they also know that they can help. You heard the Order’s reports like I did. We lost a lot, but how much worse would it have been if they hadn’t been there? If you hadn’t trusted me with Snape’s intel?”</p><p align="justify">“Perhaps it was foolish of me to hope that we would not repeat the mistakes of the past. That no child would have to pay the same price your parents and so many others have. However, it seems even our best intentions cannot stop the new generations from standing against the darkness.” Dumbledore’s smile turned grave and each of his words was measured carefully. “They trust you, Harry. Enough to follow your example and risk their lives to help others. As admirable as that is, it is a heavy burden to bear. One that you must never take for granted.”</p><p align="justify">“I won’t.” And even if he did, he could count on Ron to slap some sense into him. “But I wouldn’t worry so much about them. They know how to handle themselves.”</p><p align="justify">“I fear all the confidence in the world cannot save us from the whims of fate.” Dumbledore sighed. “And for that, I must apologize to you.”</p><p align="justify">“To me?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes.” Dumbledore’s gaze lost itself in the heavy tomes and scrolls covered in Arithmantic formulas piled up on a table, against a wall. “When I discovered the truth, a little over a year ago, I became so engrossed in my hope of devising a solution, so sure that I would succeed, that I denied you that knowledge. Alas, time makes fools of us all.”</p><p align="justify">“Well, maybe I can help with whatever that is?”</p><p align="justify">“I’m afraid it is too late for that.” His gaze met Harry’s once more, his spectacles hiding none of the sorrow it carried as he raised his blackened hand. “Even if I were to survive the coming fight, my time is approaching faster that I dared to admit.”</p><p align="justify">An icy grip took hold of Harry’s heart. He had known it was coming, of course. No amount of reassurance and playful deflections could have hidden the slow advance of the curse as the year progressed. The dead, twisted flesh that barely reached his wrist last summer had spread and now covered most of his forearm.</p><p align="justify">“Isn’t there anything we can do?”</p><p align="justify">“Even if there was, I would not accept it. I have long since made peace with my fate.” The withered arm disappeared under the desk once more. “I only delayed the inevitable in the hope of finding a solution to your condition. To help you find and destroy every Horcrux. And here we are. The Horcruxes gone and my research fruitless.”</p><p align="justify">Again with that. A solution to what?</p><p align="justify">“Sir ... What are you talking about?”</p><p align="justify">“From the depths of my heart, I am sorry I failed you, Harry.“</p><p align="justify">Wait.</p><p align="justify">“Sixteen years ago, on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill you, when your mother cast her own life to protect you, the Killing Curse rebounded upon him and a fragment of his soul, severed by the curse, latched itself onto the only living soul left in that house.”</p><p align="justify">No. He couldn’t possibly mean...</p><p align="justify">“The last Horcrux of Lord Voldemort. The one even he does not know about ... is you, Harry.”</p><p align="justify">Oh.</p><p align="justify">This...</p><p align="justify">This changed things.</p><p align="justify">It made sense, actually. So much so that he wondered why he had not seen it earlier. The headaches, the visions...</p><p align="justify">Of course, he wanted to live. But Harry could not deny that a part of him had always known he was unlikely to live a long life. Who would with the kind of danger he kept finding himself in, after all?</p><p align="justify">And yet ... This wasn’t how he had thought it would go.</p><p align="justify">There was still so much to do. So much to see.</p><p align="justify">Requirement's retrofit was almost ready. Just a few more days and every star in the sky would be within reach. They would explore strange new world, meet aliens and discover things they could not even imagine.</p><p align="justify">He would see it all with Ron and Hermione. With everyone in the DA, who had made this whole fight worth it.</p><p align="justify">With Ginny...</p><p align="justify">“Know that I would never ask you to walk to your death, Harry. And if you can forgive the selfishness of an old man in his last days, I have arranged an alternative.” Dumbledore broke the silence, his voice carrying the same weariness that was coiled around Harry’s heart. “One word of you and you will be sent to a safe place, far from Voldemort’s reach. There, you would be able to live out your life in peace.”</p><p align="justify">Albus Dumbledore. The man, who had put an end to the bloodiest war in recent memory. Who had guided a country through its darkest hours for half a century ... The man who sat with him on that balcony under the snow, knitting, laughing and sharing baking tips ... Was now begging him to flee. To abandon everything and everyone he had ever known to save his own life.</p><p align="justify">It would be so easy too...</p><p align="justify">But that was not a choice Harry could make.</p><p align="justify">Not now. Not ever.</p><p align="justify">“No. I’ll do it.”</p><p align="justify">Just like his parents did for him.</p><p align="justify">"In my long life, I have done a great many things that I regret, but none as much as my failures to you.” Dumbledore smiled sadly. “Know that I could not be prouder of the man you have become. You are very much your parents' son, yes, but you are also so much more than that. The only consolation that I can give you is that I shall be but one step behind you.”</p><p align="justify">Not much of a consolation prize. And yet, knowing he would not be going alone was strangely comforting in a way.</p><p align="justify">“If we’re doing this, we need to be sure he won’t escape again. We’ll only have this one chance.”</p><p align="justify">“Indeed.” Dumbledore nodded. “We have much we need to plan for, and precious little time to do so. I suggest you take some time to get your affairs in order while I send for the others. And maybe enjoy a snack. It’s getting late, after all.”</p><p align="justify">With a wave of his wand, two mugs of steaming hot cocoa accompanied by some crumpets and, perhaps unsurprisingly, Mars bars appeared on the desk.</p><p align="justify">There were worse last meals.</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore got up, helping himself to a mug while Harry remained seated, deep in thought.</p><p align="justify">Secrets had been shared tonight. Some of which would have followed them to the grave in other circumstances.</p><p align="justify">But what was a grave for two dead men walking?</p><p align="justify">“Sir, before you do ... I also have something to confess.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">“Alright, out with you. If you’re not injured, I don’t want to have you underfoot.” Despite their protestations, over a dozen crew members and several of their relatives were pushed out the door by Swansforth. ”If you want them to heal, then let them rest. You will see them in the morning.”</p><p align="justify">“Hey, that’s not fair!”</p><p align="justify">“Why does Harry get to stay and not us?”</p><p align="justify">“Because he is the Captain and is not flying around on his board and knocking over my equipment, which is more than I can say for you, Messrs. Weasley. Now out!”</p><p align="justify">Reginald closed the door behind the twins, allowing silence to return to the infirmary and him to his patients.</p><p align="justify">Sitting at Ginny’s bedside, Harry gave him a grateful nod as he passed her bed.</p><p align="justify">Her injuries had been severe enough that Reginald had to administer a sleeping draught to put her to sleep, granting her some much-needed rest yet robbing him of the last chance he had to speak to her.</p><p align="justify">Still, he could at least stay at her side, holding her hand. He liked to believe that she could feel his presence, even in her sleep, and that she could take comfort in it as he did in hers.</p><p align="justify">With how peaceful she looked, it was easy to pretend she had not been a hair’s breadth away from death when she had been brought in. He could almost forget that under the sheets, her body was covered in enough enchanted bandages to stock Hogwarts’ infirmary for a month. </p><p align="justify">A broken leg, five broken ribs, a punctured lung and internal bruising had been the least of her injuries. He would never be able to thank Reginald enough for his work and his assurance that she should make a full recovery.</p><p align="justify">The wonders of magic never ceased to amaze.</p><p align="justify">Yet not all of those who stayed in this room tonight had been so lucky. Dark Magic had left its mark on more than a few and it was one they would carry for the rest of their days.</p><p align="justify">Neville’s throat and lungs would recover, leaving him with a guttural voice and breathing troubles. The left side of Parvati’s face was bandaged, hiding the twisted flesh that no make-up, magical or otherwise, would ever hide and the part of her scalp where no hair would grow. The folds of Zacharias’ bedsheets accentuated the absence of his left forearm, the blanket falling limply at his elbow.</p><p align="justify">Their heroism had come to a cost. One that they would pay again and again if Voldemort was not stopped.</p><p align="justify">As if he needed another reason...</p><p align="justify">“Ginny...”</p><p align="justify">Ron and Hermione stood on the doorstep, dishevelled and still bearing the marks of battle on their suits. Yet it was their interlaced hands that brought Harry to raise his eyebrows.</p><p align="justify">When had that happened? </p><p align="justify">“How is she doing?” Hermione asked quietly.</p><p align="justify">“She’ll be fine.” Harry kissed the back of her hand, carefully placing it back on the bed before standing up. “Her armour took the worst of it and Reginald healed the rest. She won’t be leaving her bed anytime soon though.”</p><p align="justify">Ron relaxed at the news, letting go of the breath he was holding, his gaze never leaving his sister.</p><p align="justify">“I’ll look into the armours with the twins tomorrow,” Hermione said, holding Ron’s hand tightly. “I’m sure we can find a way to reinforce them.”</p><p align="justify">“We’ll need it. But I doubt you’ll have the time.” Motioning them to follow, Harry walked out of the infirmary, “Ron, About Percy...”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t.” Ron clenched his jaw, giving one last above his shoulder before stepping out into the hallway. “I don’t want to think about it right now. I don’t even know what I’m supposed to think. He was an arse. He left us and helped the Ministry. I don’t know what he was doing on that train, but...” His voice broke and died, leaving only the turmoil in his eyes. “Just ... Not now, alright?”</p><p align="justify">If they did not talk now, they never would.</p><p align="justify">But maybe, just maybe, it would be alright. They still had each other. Hermione would be able to help him through this, even without him.</p><p align="justify">All he could do now was nod and move on.</p><p align="justify">“I need to talk to you. To both of you.”</p><p align="justify">“About what?” Hermione frowned, sensing the weight of his words.</p><p align="justify">How far she had come since that day she hid in the loo, six years ago. She had so many friends now. People she could count on. And the wonders she had built since they discovered the ship...</p><p align="justify">He would have liked to see how much further she would go. No doubt she’ll write her name in the stars one day.</p><p align="justify">“Not here.”</p><p align="justify">He led them down the corridor, far from prying ears and the infirmary.</p><p align="justify">Leaving behind a pearly stone and a letter on Ginny’s nightstand.</p><hr /><p align="justify">"We’ve all lost much in this war. Family. Friends. Even one of our own."<br /><br />In a corner of Scotland long forgotten by Muggles, a tombstone stood on a hill near a large manor, a pearly stone embedded into it as it guarded an empty casket.<br /><br />"They gave everything so we could stand here today. So we could have this chance to do them justice and end this war."</p><p align="justify">St Mungo’s had been thrown into chaos, the healers and their assistants doing their best to care for the hundreds of injured crowding their halls.</p><p align="justify">On the fourth floor, sitting across from a large window behind which potion fumes kept her husband alive, Molly Weasley clutched an old sweater, tears rolling down her cheeks and falling on the knitted P.</p><p align="justify">"Voldemort, the Death Eaters, the Ministry ... They aren't just a threat to us. They're a threat to everything and everyone. If they win here today, they will not stop until they have inflicted on everyone the same suffering they have given us."</p><p align="justify">The cold voice of the Dark Lord echoed in the valley surrounding Hogwarts, delivering his ultimatum as his forces gathered on the grounds. Hundreds of witches and wizards—Aurors, Death Eaters and sympathisers alike—passed through the broken gates and unguarded walls.</p><p align="justify">"The next few hours will decide the fate of everyone on Earth. Every mother. Every son. Everyone."</p><p align="justify">Under the light of the ritual moon and the stars that pierced through its waning influence, creatures of all shapes and hides emerged from the shadows of the Forbidden Forest.</p><p align="justify">Hags rose from the undergrowth, cackling and waving their talismans. In the canopy, Vampires flew from branch to branch with grace, their bloodlust equalled only by that of the horde of Werewolves prowling beneath them.</p><p align="justify">Beyond the trees, the still waters of the Black Lake were frozen solid as a host of Dementors drifted toward shores that trembled with each step of the Giants.</p><p align="justify">"They don't know you. They don't know what you have done and sacrificed to protect their future. A future free from the threat of Voldemort. Free from his reign of madness."</p><p align="justify">The cries and moans of the convicts haunted the halls of Azkaban, to the delight of their wardens. One of them contemplated the feast this new era had brought, filling the cells to the brim, as he passed before one it particularly liked. Inside, an emaciated man with dirty blond hair was huddled in a corner, relieving the death of his wife over and over again, pleading for his little moonbeam to forgive him.</p><p align="justify">"But remember. You’re not alone in this fight."</p><p align="justify">On the castle’s highest floor, in a hallway long forgotten by the rest of the student body, Seamus latched his vambrace, opening and closing his hand to test the deployment of the shield. Hunched over his back, Terry inserted a new energy cell in his invisibility module, throwing the burnt one away.</p><p align="justify">Next to them, the impossible metal door slid open and Angelina stepped out in full gear, hoverboard in hand and leading half a dozen others similarly equipped. Under the curious gaze of Barnabas the Barmy and his trolls, gadgets and pranking tools were passed around by Lee and George while Fred tinkered with a large egg-shaped device.</p><p align="justify">"We face our enemy together. And countless others stand with us."</p><p align="justify">A line of animated suits of armour manned a barricade conjured of stone and wood a short distance from the shores of the Black Lake, barring the way to the castle for the invaders. Rallied for their final stand, the Order of the Phoenix stood side by side with Amelia Bones’ Aurors and the remnants of the Muggle-born resistance.</p><p align="justify">Yet the British would not face their darkest hour alone, for among them were men and women from across the continent, rallied behind the banner of Beauxbatons’ headmistress.</p><p align="justify">And of course, standing defiantly at the feet of the barricade, was Albus Dumbledore.</p><p align="justify">"Today, we take a stand. We will show them that there are still those who will fight for a better tomorrow and live to see it."</p><p align="justify">In the dungeons beneath the castle, a mass of students in green-trimmed robes tried to leave their common room, wand in hand and ink in their arm, only for the passage to remain sealed.</p><p align="justify">On the other side, Daphne completed the final pass of her wand over the wall, reciting an ancient incantation. With Gregory standing watch, Tracey pulled out a small vial and brought the last drops of a singing, golden liquid to her lips.</p><p align="justify">"I know you'll make me proud, as you have done every day since we took to the stars. So today, it's up to you to make yourself proud. Proud of who you are. Proud of what we stand for."</p><p align="justify">In orbit around Earth, Ron stood on Requirement’s bridge, the crew busying themselves around him as he looked down at the planet below with a grave look upon his face.</p><p align="justify">"And no matter what happens, remember that this is not the end. This is only the beginning of our journey."</p><p align="justify">On the other side of the solar system, Ginny struggled with all her strength against Reginald and Susan’s efforts to drag her back to bed, crying out in distress as tears streamed freely down her face.</p><p align="justify">A crumpled letter laid forgotten at the feet of her bed, and from the stone she held against her heart, Harry’s words were clear for all to hear.</p><p align="justify">“Still, I’ve never been the most patient.”</p><p align="justify">Harry came out of the barricade’s shadows to stand at Dumbledore’s side, dressed in simple school robes.</p><p align="justify">Despite the cries and pleas from the men and women on the barricades, despite Sirius’s shouts as Hagrid restrained him, Harry walked down the hill toward the invading army, answering the Dark Lord’s ultimatum.</p><p align="justify">“And I hope that in time, you will forgive me because...”</p><p align="justify">Never one to pass an opportunity to demonstrate his power, Voldemort stepped forward, announcing a duel that would once and for all put an end to the tale of the Boy Who Lived.</p><p align="justify">They bowed, echoing their encounter two years prior, and engaged in a dance of spells that lit up the night under the eyes of a country, Harry barely holding his own against the greatest dark lord of a generation.</p><p align="justify">"I'll be going first."</p><p align="justify">As soon as he saw the familiar emerald light, Harry dropped his defences, welcoming the curse with a sad smile.</p><p align="justify">The last thing he saw was a sky full of stars.</p><hr /><p align="justify">Nothing.</p><p align="justify">That’s what Harry had expected.</p><p align="justify">Or, more precisely, he hadn’t expected to still be able to feel. To think.</p><p align="justify">Growing up the way he did, he had never given much thought to religion. And while the idea of a life after death was comforting, he could never really bring himself to believe.</p><p align="justify">And yet ... Here he was.</p><p align="justify">His eyes opened to the familiar vaulted ceiling of Requirement’s Bridge, shrouded in darkness. The only light saving him from being lost in the dark came from the large windows of the observation deck, behind which the Earth slowly turned in the void.</p><p align="justify">If this was the afterlife, someone had forgotten to pay the bills.</p><p align="justify">“You know, I never thought I would ever get to see the world from above.”</p><p align="justify">Harry pushed himself up, his hand reaching for a wand that was not there as he peered into the darkness, searching for the owner of the voice.</p><p align="justify">Behind the main console, he could barely make out a figure sitting on the command chair.</p><p align="justify">His chair.</p><p align="justify">“Hello?”</p><p align="justify">The stranger got up and walked right through the console and out of the shadows.</p><p align="justify">Had Harry not known better, he would have thought himself looking at a mirror, his reflection looking back at him with a smirk and deep red eyes.</p><p align="justify">“Hello, Harry. I’ve been waiting for you.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="justify">In a valley bathed by the light of the moon, in the shadow of Hogwarts, a legend breathed his last.</p><p align="justify">Under the eyes of a country, a boy died before his body could hit the ground.</p><p align="justify">Down the hill, hundreds cheered. Celebrating the end of a symbol.</p><p align="justify">At the foot of the castle, the scant remnants of those who would stand against the tide shed their tears for a martyr, bracing themselves for what was to come.</p><p align="justify">Standing before them, unwavering in the face of an inexorable fate, was the man who had taught them; Who had guided them through their darker hours since before their birth and who would now see them die.</p><p align="justify">Ignoring the jeers and taunts of his greatest failure, Dumbledore watched the demise of another.</p><p align="justify">“Harry ... I’m sorry.”</p><p align="justify">Tearing his gaze from the body of a man who had given up more than anyone could imagine, Dumbledore thrust his wand to the sky, firing a beam of light that pierced the very heavens.</p><p align="justify">“It’s over Tom.”</p><p align="justify">The late spring air cooled noticeably, clouds forming and swirling around the pillar of light as the wind picked up.</p><p align="justify">“No more hiding behind your servants.”</p><p align="justify">The jeers and cheers turned to restlessness as the clouds darkened and grew, bringing with them the rolling thunder.</p><p align="justify">“No more coming back.”</p><p align="justify">Voldemort peered at the whirlpool of clouds and lightning, barely making out a vast, dark shape descending above the castle, hidden amongst the overcast.</p><p align="justify">“This ends tonight.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">“Shields are holding re-entry.” Cho announced. “Correcting course to stop fifteen hundred above the castle.”</p><p align="justify">“Allied forces have formed a perimeter more than two kilometres from the castle’s walls. The invading force is ... It’s massive.” Malcolm Baddock read out the ship’s sensor data. “I’m even reading some giants down there.”</p><p align="justify">“They brought everyone then. Good.”</p><p align="justify">Standing before the great vaulted windows, Ron looked upon the battlefield sprawling below them. Armies facing each other in a place that had always felt so removed from the war.</p><p align="justify">Like all those he had trained, Ron had shed his fair share of blood in this war. He had fought and bled from the Ministry debacle to the massacre at Glasgow, mere hours ago.</p><p align="justify">He had stood by Harry as they faced Trolls, Acromantulas and murderous lunatics.</p><p align="justify">And yet, in all this time, Ron had never taken a life.</p><p align="justify">Stunning hex, flash grenades, a heavy blow to the head ... He had always found a way to minimise casualties.</p><p align="justify">This war was already costing them so much, and he had no wish to let it stain his soul with murder. To let it turn him into the monsters they were facing.</p><p align="justify">Regrettably, life did not care for his wishes, and the present circumstances had forced their hand.</p><p align="justify">The reality of what he was about to do weighed heavily on him, as did the knowledge that this was something he had chosen to do.</p><p align="justify">He had chosen to do the right thing. Not something that would make it easy to sleep at night or that he would ever do again if given the choice, but the right thing nonetheless.</p><p align="justify">And despite sharing his feelings on the matter, others had chosen to follow him on this path.</p><p align="justify">“Dial down weapons power to five percent and start picking targets. Keep it to short bursts and prioritise those going for the barricade, but keep your aim clear off the castle and the frontline.”</p><p align="justify">Across the bridge, he could see Marietta and Cho exchanging nervous glances while Malcolm trembled in his seat. Katie stared straight at the display before her, her jaw set in apprehension as she moved the command stone of the weapons console.</p><p align="justify">While he was grateful for their trust and willingness to go along with this, and he knew that, in time, they would rise beyond it.</p><p align="justify">Because ultimately, as the new person in charge, the responsibility fell to him.</p><p align="justify">This war could not be allowed to continue. They needed to put an end to the threat, once and for all. To do all they could against those who, for all intents and purposes, had killed his dad and fractured his family.</p><p align="justify">He had already failed too many times.</p><p align="justify">He had not been there for Ginny as she poured her heart and life to a madman in a desperate search for comfort.</p><p align="justify">He had failed to reach her when she disappeared, digging in the dark while Harry faced a Basilisk alone to save her.</p><p align="justify">He had been so busy playing around on the ship that he let his father down, leaving him trapped in a never-ending sleep.</p><p align="justify">He had let his childish resentment against Percy drive a wedge between them, isolating him and leaving him to die far from his family.</p><p align="justify">No more.</p><p align="justify">With a single word, he would keep them safe. Keep them all safe.</p><p align="justify">All but one.</p><p align="justify">Ron clenched his fist tightly, feeling his nails drawing blood as he kept looking down on the ground below, searching for something he did not want to see.</p><p align="justify">In chess, every piece had a role. You developed them in a way where they could cover each other and benefit from their unique traits. You followed strategies and adapted in response to the enemy’s. Yet sometimes ... sometimes, a sacrifice was necessary.</p><p align="justify">It seemed cruel, sending pieces to die, taking the enemy's with them to open the way for those who followed. But that’s how it worked. That’s how you won.</p><p align="justify">He hated this plan with every fibre of his being, but Harry had entrusted him with a mission. A chance to end the war once and for all. To make things right for everyone.</p><p align="justify">For his family.</p><p align="justify">For the crew.</p><p align="justify">But not for Harry.</p><p align="justify">"Fire."</p><hr /><p align="justify">A rain of blue flames burst from the maelstrom of clouds, bringing down death and chaos upon the invaders. Large swathes of the grounds were blown away in a pandemonium of scorched earth and bodies as the Death Eaters and their allies broke ranks. Some among them tried to apparate away and came crashing down on the ground, denied by Hogwarts’ wards.</p><p align="justify">For a brief moment, Dumbledore stood awed and terrified as he beheld the destruction his students could call down on a whim. He had heeded Harry’s dire warnings, entrenching their side near the castle, yet seeing it with his own eyes...</p><p align="justify">“Storm the barricade, you fools! They will not fire upon their own!”</p><p align="justify">Voldemort’s orders pierced the tumult and brought more than Dumbledore back to reality, starting a mad rush toward the castle. As spells filled the air, adding to the chaos, the flames raining from the sky became rarer and more precise, taking out many who came too close to the barricade.</p><p align="justify">One of the fireballs attempted to intercept Voldemort as he spearheaded the assault and with a large motion, the Dark Lord sent it crashing upon the castle wall, showering the defenders with rubble.</p><p align="justify">With a wide swish of his wand, Dumbledore turned the larger wall fragments into eagles who came bearing down on the Death Eaters following after Voldemort.</p><p align="justify">And with a crash of spells, the Titans met, engaging in a duel none dared to approach in fear of being caught in the crossfire.</p><p align="justify">Instead, the followers of the Dark Lord crashed upon the barricade like a wave against a cliff, its defenders keeping them at bay with spells and halberds while Amelia and her Aurors conjured Patronus to stave off the Dementors.</p><p align="justify">On the outskirts of the battle, Death Eaters isolated by the chaos disappeared in the night. In the upturned soil, the footprints of their invisible opponent going off in search of new prey were the only clue as to their fate.</p><p align="justify">Free from their paddock, a herd of Hyppogriffs took to the skies, engaging in a deadly dance with the vampires and a group of Aurors on brooms. The hybrid creatures would have been quickly overrun were it not for Madam Hooch leading a team of professional Quidditch players to their help, throwing bludgers and spells into their adversaries.</p><p align="justify">With the enemy’s air support otherwise occupied, six invisible fighters swooped across the battlefield, performing strafing runs on Werewolves and other dangerous groups before they could reach the barricade.</p><p align="justify">Despite most of their brethren having perished in the first strike, several Giants reached the barricade, tearing huge chunks of it with their bare hands. While over a dozen animated armours climbed one of them, stabbing its hide with their halberds until it fell, Hagrid and his half-brother Grawp wrestled another, tripping him into the lake. As he struggled in the shallows, countless webbed hands and thick tentacles grabbed his limbs, dragging him into the depths.</p><p align="justify">Amidst the invaders’ broken ranks, large metallic eggs were dropped, eliciting surprise and caution when the spells they cast to destroy them proved ineffective. Those feelings turned to incredulity and fear when the eggs hatched and mechanical chickens sporting bowler hats ran across the battlefield, clucking and throwing egg-shaped grenades that took out dozens in explosions of electricity.</p><p align="justify">Revelling in the chaos, Peeves plunged head-first into the invading army, leaving fireworks and dungbombs in his wake. Those who tried to stop him found themselves tied up by their own robes, making them an easy target for the arrows of the Centaurs hidden on the edge of the forest.</p><p align="justify">Voldemort had sought to conquer a country and it was fighting back.</p><hr /><p align="justify">In a place both far and close to the battle, Harry faced his double on Requirement’s bridge, squinting to discern his familiar features in the dim light.</p><p align="justify">“Who are you?”</p><p align="justify">“Do I need to spell it out?” The duplicate—no, the Horcrux—raised an eyebrow above a deep red eye.  “Come on, Harry, I know you. You’re not that dumb.”</p><p align="justify">“Right...” Harry gazed around the empty bridge, keeping his duplicate in his line of sight. “And this is?”</p><p align="justify">“Your mind, the afterlife, another plane of existence ... Your guess is as good as mine.” The Horcrux shrugged.  “Despite my research on the nature of souls, I never bothered with all this spiritual stuff.”</p><p align="justify">“You’re ... Not what I expected.”</p><p align="justify">“And what did you expect? Voldemort?”</p><p align="justify">“Well ... yes? Or a ghost. These Horcruses aren’t really consistent.”</p><p align="justify">“I am him. Just as I am you. Two souls cannot inhabit the somebody for as long as ours did without bleeding out into each other.”</p><p align="justify">“Right. Like how I can speak parseltongue or feel when he’s close.”</p><p align="justify">“Precisely. As I said, you aren’t that dumb.” The Horcrux smiled, his tone condescending. “For a year, you have spent your days far from Earth, weakening the bond that links me to the main part of my soul. While this isolation shielded you from his influence, it also strengthened me.”</p><p align="justify">“So these headaches I was having on Earth...”</p><p align="justify">“The efforts of the main part of my soul to reach into your mind, to cloud your judgement and bring you to him I assume. I always had a fondness for this type of underhanded plan.” The Horcrux rolled his eyes. “Soon enough, I awoke, fully conscious yet too weak to break free from the shackles that locked me in the deepest reaches of your mind.”</p><p align="justify">Despite his apparent love for hearing himself talk—a trait that reassured Harry of how unalike they truly were—the Horcrux was growing agitated, pacing around the bridge without making a sound. Never letting it leave his sight, Harry looked around once more, searching for something—anything—that could help.</p><p align="justify">Like the rest of the ship, the consoles were dead, lacking even the command stones necessary to operate them. The cold embers of his hope flared anew, however, when he saw a screen burst to life, until his brain caught up with the rest of his senses.</p><p align="justify">Where only a voice had filled the room, he could now hear footsteps.</p><p align="justify">“So I waited. Watching, Learning. Bidding my time until I grew strong enough to touch your mind. To whisper in your subconscious.” The condescending smile turned predatory. ”And you made it so easy. Isolating yourself, pushing your friends away and refusing to act while the world crumbled around you ... The more desperate you grew, the stronger I became.”</p><p align="justify">The sensor and weapon consoles came to life, their command stones appearing on their panels, bringing some more light into the room. Harry took a step back, a cold feeling seizing his heart as the Horcrux opened and closed his hand as it talked, testing his grip.</p><p align="justify">“When the Macmillan boy died, I thought I had finally broken you. The smallest nudge would have pushed you over the edge. And yet, you managed to claw your way back, pushing me away.” He looked at Harry again, a fire now burning behind his red irises. “Given enough time, I would have worn you out again, taking control once and for all. However, you had the wonderful idea of committing suicide at the hands of my other self, clearing the way for my takeover. Had I known you were so eager to die, I would have made myself known far sooner.”</p><p align="justify">Every console on the bridge was now active, the entire room lighting up and the floor under his feet trembling ever so slightly, the ship coming to life as Harry felt his own slip away.</p><p align="justify">“Truly, I must thank you. While you have been annoyingly defiant, you have managed to do quite well for yourself. Building yourself a small empire in the stars. And now, I will be taking it all while you fade into nothingness.”</p><p align="justify">His whole body was stiff and cold, barely responding to his will. He opened his mouth to talk, to shout a rebuttal, yet no sound passed his lips.</p><p align="justify">"You don't even realise the potential of what you found. You squander it by playing like a child with a fancy new toy while you could destroy all that stands in your path and conquer this galaxy."  The Horcrux looked down on Harry as he fell to his knees. “But do not fret. I will take great care of it.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">Dumbledore and Voldemort were locked in their duel, exchanging spells and turning the other’s attack against him. Neither of them holding anything back. The brutality of their fight had dug part of the hill into an arena, outside of which the battle raged and the fire kept raining down from the heavens.</p><p align="justify">His robes torn and his arm hanging limply by his side, Dumbledore twisted his wand and brought it forward, charming the earth to rise and meld into hands of stones that flew toward Voldemort. The elder wand proved difficult to wield when beset by a curse-ridden body and exhaustion, yet his efforts had not proven futile.</p><p align="justify">Voldemort destroyed all but two of the hands, which grasped his forearms tightly, spreading them far apart and holding them in place. The dark lord did not fare much better than Dumbledore did, the battle having taken its toll of flesh and magic from him.</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore brought his wand to his lips and, exhaling softly, turned it in a spiral motion as he pointed it back at Voldemort, creating an icy wind that froze everything in its path solid.</p><p align="justify">With a cry of rage, Voldemort freed himself, the stone hands exploding under his wrath. His wand slashed the air, conjuring a large metal snake that coiled itself around him, shielding him from the freezing wind. When it had passed, the metal vanished and Voldemort broke the ice, banishing its shards toward Dumbledore before he could react.</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore fell to his knees, his wand falling to the ground and rolling away from his bloodied and broken body.</p><p align="justify">Serenely, Voldemort closed the distance, grinning despite his injuries.</p><p align="justify">“And so the mighty falls. Broken and alone.” He picked up the wand of his fallen foe, jubilating. “Like Potter, you will-” His red eyes grew wide as he discovered a small symbol, engraved on the handle. A circle inside a triangle, both bisected by a vertical line. “Of course...” Voldemort caressed the knobby wand, almost reverently. “You had it all along.”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore could only watch as Voldemort raised the elder wand to the sky, summoning a colossal bolt of lightning toward the dark shape hiding in the clouds.</p><hr /><p align="justify">“Shields are failing! Systems are shutting down all over!”</p><p align="justify">“We’ve just lost weapons!”</p><p align="justify">The ship shook under their feet and the consoles spat sparks as they heard explosions in the distance. The screen monitoring the sensor feeds burst up in flames, singeing Malcolm as he backed away from the now dead console.</p><p align="justify">“Damn it!” Ron brought his fist down on the window’s arch. “Get us back in orbit. There’s nothing else we can do here.”</p><p align="justify">Wasting no time, Cho and Marietta moved the stones on their respective consoles.</p><p align="justify">Groaning and shaking, the ship rose away from the battlefield and Ron watched the castle and its defenders grow smaller until they disappeared under the cloud layer.</p><hr /><p align="justify">The dust on the battlefield settled as all witnessed the lightning disappear and the clouds part, bringing about the end of the fire rain.</p><p align="justify">With an almost nonchalant swish of his new wand, Voldemort engulfed the remains of the barricade in cursed flames, turning a number of its defenders to ashes with it as the rest fell back to the castle.</p><p align="justify">Dark blood tinted the lake as a giant emerged from the depths, a severed tentacle in its grip. Hyppogriffs and broken brooms crashed all around him, out-manoeuvered by the Vampires.</p><p align="justify">At the edge of the forest, the Centaurs retreated under the assault of the Dementors, leaving the soulless bodies of their own at the mercy of the Werewolves.</p><p align="justify">In the arena their duel had carved, Voldemort looked down at the broken form of the old man who had been a thorn in his side for the better part of a century. He had envisioned this moment for so long. Dreamed of this day over and over.</p><p align="justify">And now. Finally. He would have his revenge.</p><p align="justify">Tears ran freely from Dumbledore’s eyes, rolling down his face and losing themselves in his long white beard, smeared with dirt and blood.</p><p align="justify">“Harry ... I’m so sorry...”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore closed his eyes and Voldemort brought up his wand, determined not to let the chance to kill him himself slip away.</p><p align="justify">Yet, the Dark Lord stopped, his eyes going wide as he took a step back.</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore’s entire body glowed a pure, blinding white light, his robes and spectacles falling to the ground as he rose in the air and, sent off by the distant cry of a Phoenix, disappeared.</p><hr /><p align="justify">While Harry struggled to even stay upright, the Horcrux walked around the bridge, inspecting the consoles. </p><p align="justify">“All this power in the palm of your hand.” He picked up a command stone, weighing it in his hand. “And to think you wasted it on joyrides ... Pitiful.”</p><p align="justify">He threw the stone aside, walking back to Harry.</p><p align="justify">“I have watched you for so long, even before I awoke. I watched you grow up, alone and insecure. I watched you defy me at every turn, delaying my return. I watched you find this ship and make it yours. And yet...”</p><p align="justify">Seizing Harry by the jaw, the Horcrux forced him to look up at him.</p><p align="justify">“I never understood you.”</p><p align="justify">Gathering his strength, Harry grabbed the Horcrux’s wrist in an attempt to push him away.</p><p align="justify">“Yes, this. Why do you keep resisting? I could understand if you did not wish to die, but you willingly walked to your death! So why?” He grabbed Harry’s hand, forcing him to let go as he leaned forward, searching for an answer in Harry’s expression. “Why do you keep fighting for these vermins?”</p><p align="justify">“Because they’re worth fighting for.”</p><p align="justify">Harry grabbed the Horcrux’s arm.</p><p align="justify">“And I won’t let you pervert our dream.”</p><p align="justify">Harry spun, taking the Horcrux with him as he apparated away.</p><p align="justify">They appeared outside the ship and Harry tightened his grip as gravity took hold. Beneath them, Earth grew larger and larger as they picked up speed, falling to their death.</p><p align="justify">“You can’t do this!”</p><p align="justify">“Watch me.”</p><p align="justify">The Horcrux looked at him in fear, wrestling against him to try and free himself.</p><p align="justify">“Idiot! You’ll kill us both!”</p><p align="justify">“Doesn’t matter. We’re riding this to the end.”</p><p align="justify">Fuelled by desperation, the Horcrux struggled against his grasp. Gritting his teeth and grabbing on tighter, Harry held firm, even as the heat became untenable, their clothes and flesh burning away.</p><p align="justify">Not wishing to see his own face looking up at him in terror as it burned, Harry closed his eyes and, for the second time, welcomed his end...</p><p align="justify">Yet, even with his eyes closed he could see the light, pure, white and brighter than the sun, taking him in its warm embrace and chasing away the pain as it engulfed the world.</p><hr /><p align="justify">For once, Harry did not wake up to pain when he had expected it.</p><p align="justify">And yet, this lack of any pain seemed the most alien feeling in the world when one did not expect to wake up at all.</p><p align="justify">He breathed in, regretting it instantly as he took in the smell of charred flesh.</p><p align="justify">Covering his nose, Harry pushed himself up, throwing off the upturned earth that had buried his lower half.</p><p align="justify">Everywhere around him, bodies littered the ground. From Giants to Death Eaters, the grounds were covered in them.</p><p align="justify">This was a sight he had been glad he would not have to see.</p><p align="justify">And yet, here he was.</p><p align="justify">He picked up his wand, unsure of what to do with it.</p><p align="justify">He should be dead.</p><p align="justify">More than that, he had died. He was sure of it.</p><p align="justify">Harry passed a hand over his scar and stared at the blood covering his palm in wonder.</p><p align="justify">Was the Horcrux ... gone?</p><p align="justify">But why wasn’t he dead too?</p><p align="justify">Had it been that light at the end?</p><p align="justify">But why? How?</p><p align="justify">Harry wiped the blood away, conjuring water to clean his face and clear his mind.</p><p align="justify">It did not matter.</p><p align="justify">If he was here and the Horcrux was gone...</p><p align="justify">He could not find the world to describe the relief flooding through his veins, the giddiness that brought a smile to his lips nor the hope soaring in his heart.</p><p align="justify">The thunder of explosions and the roar of flames echoed in the distance, nipping his joy in the bud.</p><p align="justify">Looking up, all he could see was a sea of stars surrounding the full moon.</p><p align="justify">The ship was gone, the barricade had fallen and the Death Eaters were storming the castle.</p><p align="justify">This was no time to celebrate.</p><p align="justify">He started running, jumping over corpses and craters.</p><p align="justify">Scores of Death Eaters, one giant, a swarm of Dementors and, if the flames were any indication, Voldemort was still around.</p><p align="justify">No ship, no suit, no apparition and no back-up.</p><p align="justify">He could do this.</p><p align="justify">Passing the remains of the barricade, Harry came in sight of the stragglers, looting and resting while the rest of their ilk massed at the castle’s door.</p><p align="justify">His wand whipped the air and he kept running, three more bodies hitting the ground before they could understand what was happening.</p><p align="justify">The giant limped toward the door, winding his fist up to strike like a colossal battering ram. Dementors filled the air around him, drifting around impatiently while the Death Eaters massed at his feet.</p><p align="justify">As he ran, Harry grabbed a halberd stuck in the ground next to the remains of its armour. Holding it in front of him, he set his wand flat on the shaft and thrust forward. The weapon burst into the air like a rocket, digging itself deep into the base of the giant’s skull.</p><p align="justify">The hulking corpse collapsed, crushing several Death Eaters as it fell and bringing upon Harry the attention of the rest.</p><p align="justify">The horde of dementors swooped down on him with a hundred hungry wails, swarming from all sides until a large stag of light burst forth, breaking their assault and sending them running.</p><p align="justify">The element of surprise now spent, Harry stood alone, a hundred wands coming up between him and the castle.</p><p align="justify">“How?”</p><p align="justify">The sea of dark robes parted, making way for a battered Voldemort. The battle had not been kind to him, his pale skin marred by cuts and bruises while every step he took tinted his hateful scowl with pain.</p><p align="justify">“How can you be alive? What will it take for you to stay dead?”</p><p align="justify">“How about we find out?”</p><p align="justify">Harry assumed a duelling stance, adrenaline pumping in his veins and heart beating in his ears.</p><p align="justify">He had held his own against Voldemort before stepping into the killing curse. Now that he was injured and tired, he had a chance to take him down.</p><p align="justify">A chance was all he needed.</p><p align="justify">“Insolent whelp.”</p><p align="justify">Voldemort’s hand was a blur of motions, curses rushing toward Harry faster than he could see them.</p><p align="justify">Jumping to the side, he conjured a shield, only to see it shatter a second later as a curse ploughed through it.</p><p align="justify">The next threw him to the ground, crying out in agony as every bone in his left arm imploded.</p><p align="justify">“Did you truly think you could face Lord Voldemort?”</p><p align="justify">Thick, thorny vines grew from the earth, coiling themselves around Harry’s wrists and ankles, drawing blood and pinning him down.</p><p align="justify">“I do not know what trick you used to survive, but it does not matter.”</p><p align="justify">Struggling against the vines only resulted in them digging deeper into his flesh. Looking to the side through his askew glasses, Harry saw his wand, lost in the dirt and out of reach.</p><p align="justify">“We’ll just have to use more ... radical means.”</p><p align="justify">“You don't want to do that.”</p><p align="justify">If there was one thing he knew about Voldemort, it was that he loved to hear himself talk. As long as he did, he would keep him alive, buying him the time to look around, searching for a way to free himself.</p><p align="justify">“Do you intend to barter for your life?” Voldemort walked up to him, towering over him like a Dementor over its prey. “After all of this?”</p><p align="justify">“Kill me, and you lose your Horcruxes.”</p><p align="justify">Voldemort paused, his wand twitching in his hand.</p><p align="justify">“You lie. You would have destroyed them the moment they came into your possession.”</p><p align="justify">“We did. Except for the ring and the diadem.” Harry lied through his teeth, his gaze focused on the castle behind Voldemort. “They were too valuable to destroy without trying to save them.”</p><p align="justify">“Where?” Voldemort scowled. “Where did you hide them?”</p><p align="justify">“Let those in the castle go and I’ll show you.”</p><p align="justify">Voldemort twisted his wand and a new vine sprouted, coiling around Harry’s throat as the others tightened their grasp, eliciting a cry of pain from him.</p><p align="justify">“Do you take me for a fool? I know Dumbledore. He would not be foolish enough to take such a risk.”</p><p align="justify">“I asked him to!”</p><p align="justify">The vines loosened, leaving Harry struggling to breathe.</p><p align="justify">“And why would he listen to you? A pampered brat clinging to the accomplishments of others?”</p><p align="justify">“Because he’s not you.” Despite the pain, despite Voldemort watching him closely, Harry could not stop himself from smiling. ”That’s the difference between us, Tom. We have friends we can trust.”</p><p align="justify">A dozen spells materialized out of thin air, converging on Voldemort.</p><p align="justify">Twisting in a blur, the dark lord intercepted most of them and winced in pain as he whipped his wand in a great circle.</p><p align="justify">The vines restraining Harry fell to the ground, cut to shreds as invisible hands dragged him away and helped him back up.</p><p align="justify">A wave of shimmering light washed over the battlefield, revealing fourteen familiar silhouettes, their damaged and scorched armours crackling with electricity as they became visible.</p><p align="justify">Surrounded, Voldemort looked around, wand at the ready as he appraised the situation, searching for an opening. For a brief moment, he dared to look above his shoulder, discovering his remaining followers dead at the feet of the castle’s defenders.</p><p align="justify">“So it was you.” His glare came down upon Harry again, rage and understanding fuelling his voice as he took in the strange armours of those holding him up and giving him back his wand. “You’re the one responsible for this.”</p><p align="justify">“We all were.” Harry shook his head, chasing the fog of pain dulling his senses as he raised his wand to join those of his friends. “Now go to hell. The rest of you is already waiting.”</p><p align="justify">A barrage of spells came down upon Voldemort, deflected by his shield or intercepted by the Dark Lord’s own.</p><p align="justify">“I am Lord Voldemort!”</p><p align="justify">The ground exploded, sending a few of his assailants flying.</p><p align="justify">“I have conquered Death itself!”</p><p align="justify">So hurried he was to deflect a curse that another hit his unguarded back.</p><p align="justify">“You will—”</p><p align="justify">His voice died as he fell to his knees, a gaping hole in his throat.</p><p align="justify">His red eyes were locked with Harry’s and his face contorted in pain and hate.</p><p align="justify">A trembling hand brought up his stolen, knobby wand before his feeble grasp faltered, letting it fall to the ground.</p><p align="justify">And, finally, Tom Riddle breathed his last.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="justify">Voldemort’s body hit the ground heavily, one more casualty in a day that had seen thousands.</p><p align="justify">The dread and disquiet it inspired took far longer to pass, however, as Seamus and Goyle approached his unmoving form warily. Had Hermione not been the only thing allowing him to stay standing, despite the agony that the arm hanging limply at his side was putting him through, Harry would have joined them. As Goyle took Dumbledore’s wand away, Seamus had to prob the body a few times before everyone could finally breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p align="justify">It was over.</p><p align="justify">After terrorising the country for nearly forty years, Lord Voldemort was finally dead. And there would be no coming back this time.</p><p align="justify">The dust had settled and the rest of Hogwart’s defenders had joined them, some sharing their relief while others looked at them with suspicion.</p><p align="justify">In the crowd, faces that Harry would have expected to see were nowhere to be found. Professor Sprout, Madam Hooch and many others were not standing behind McGonagall and Amelia Bones. No matter how long he searched, he could not see Oliver Wood nor Remus partake in the accolades with Tonks, Bill and Fleur.</p><p align="justify">Sirius rushed out of the crowd, ignoring the Aurors still debating whether there were friends or foes, and embraced him as carefully as his eagerness allowed him.</p><p align="justify">“What the hell were you thinking, going alone like that?”</p><p align="justify">“I had to.” Despite the pain and Sirius’ glare, Harry could not contain the smile born from seeing him alive. Injured and dishevelled, but alive. “It was the only way”</p><p align="justify">“You’re lucky you’re still alive or you would have been grounded until you reached Dumbledore’s age.”</p><p align="justify">“He never will if you don’t let go of him.” Hermione interrupted sternly.</p><p align="justify">“Right, right...” Sirius stepped back. “We should get you inside.”</p><p align="justify">“Is Dumbledore there already?”</p><p align="justify">“Dumbledore...” Sirius’ smile faltered as he searched for the right words. “He never made it to the castle. With the fire he rained from the sky and everything else going on ... I didn’t see what happened, but some say he vanished in a flash of light.”</p><p align="justify">A flash of light?</p><p align="justify">But then...</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry, Harry.”</p><p align="justify">“No. No, it’s alright.” Harry ignored the looks of pity and looked up to the castle, a faint smile on his lips. “It’s all gonna be alright.”</p><hr /><p align="justify">The next few days went by in a flash, what with everyone running around, taking care of the injured and cleaning up the worst of the battle.</p><p align="justify">Food, blankets and other necessities were conjured liberally and distributed both in Hogwarts and the Muggle world, easing some of the worries of the relief efforts. So great was their need and gratefulness that no one dared to pry into the origin of the supplies these strangely dressed teenagers kept bringing in, for fear they would stop.</p><p align="justify">The sudden disappearance of Voldemort and most of his forces did not put an end to the fighting, however. Many of his followers remained in positions of power across the country and took the news of his defeat poorly, barricading themselves or going on a rampage.</p><p align="justify">Amelia Bones was not one to sit around and waste a tactical advantage, however. Before the news of what had happened at Hogwarts could spread, she spearheaded an assault on the Ministry, retaking the building from the skeleton crew that had been left behind.</p><p align="justify">Not that Harry had witnessed any of it, mind you, what with being stuck in the infirmary with Ginny in the next bed over being determined to make sure he would never try to walk to his death ever again.</p><p align="justify">Declaring herself provisional Minister, Amelia Bones got to work reigning in the chaos raging across the country. Her first official act saw Azkaban emptied, freeing all the dissidents who dared to speak against the previous administration. While the Ministry welcomed back some much-needed manpower, families across the country were reunited, the Lovegood first among them. Yet, despite these joyous reunions and Voldemort’s demise, the skies remained clear of the fireworks and celebrations that had lit the night sixteen years prior.</p><p align="justify">Aurors still combed through the countryside, hunting the dementors that had yet to return to Azkaban, while what remained of the unspeakable researched a better way to contain these unkillable monsters. The idea of sealing them in a big box deep underground and throwing away the key seemed quite popular after their role in the war.</p><p align="justify">Capturing rogue Death Eaters and repelling insane laws quickly became the least of the new Minister’s problems, however, when her Muggle counterpart and the ICW stepped in, demanding an explanation for the many massive breaches of the Statute of Secrecy.</p><p align="justify">Despite their efforts to bulk up their rank—including offering an Auror position to Harry—there was not much of a government to speak of to tackle this new political turmoil. The months under Malfoy’s regime and the terror of its last day had cost a great number of lives, and many more had fled the country. Entire families had been wiped out and the Ministry had been gutted out, leaving Bones with only a handful of aids to deal with the rebuilding.</p><p align="justify">To make matters worse, they would have to make do without the support of the Boy Who Lived.</p><p align="justify">Some might consider his unwillingness to help them rebuild society selfish, a dereliction of the responsibilities brought by his status in the eyes of the people. Abandoning them in their time of need while he embodied the fight against the previous regime and the hope for a better tomorrow would only weaken their efforts, as Minister Bones had put it.</p><p align="justify">Yet, as far as Harry was concerned, he had done his part.</p><p align="justify">The Ministry would have his help, in the form of manpower and conjured supplies, but politics and hunting dark wizards was not something he was willing to dedicate his life to. Not when there was a whole universe just waiting to be explored.</p><p align="justify">More than that ... Dumbledore, Remus, Mr. Weasley ... So many had fallen, and the wondrous magical world that Harry had discovered six years ago had become a shadow of its former self.</p><p align="justify">Time would do its work and the world would heal, but for now, the people and building carried with them the scars of a war he would rather forget. There would come a time when he would walk the Earth once more, instead of looking down at it from the stars.</p><p align="justify">But for now ... There was nothing for him down there anymore.</p><hr /><p align="justify">“In all my years in this castle, I have never found a better view. And believe me, I tried.”</p><p align="justify">“It is pretty great.”</p><p align="justify">Beyond the treetops, the rays of the sun pierced the horizon and bathed the grounds in their golden light. The Black Lake glistened as students braved its cold waters to play with the Giant Squid, giving a spectacle to those who enjoyed a morning walk. Cheers and jeers could be heard in the distance, spurring on the Quidditch team practising on the pitch.</p><p align="justify">Sitting in a swivel chair on a balcony overlooking the grounds, Harry took a slow sip of his tea, enjoying the view. A far too long and unevenly knitted multicoloured scarf was draped around his neck, keeping him warm despite the cold morning air.</p><p align="justify">“I’m gonna miss all of this.”</p><p align="justify">“You could always stay.” His companion hovered his hand over the plate filled with baked goods, hesitating momentarily before picking up a glazed jam scone. “You still have a year left before your graduation.”</p><p align="justify">“I can’t. After everything that happened...” Harry shook his head. “It wouldn’t be the same.”</p><p align="justify">“Hogwarts will not be the same without you either.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m almost tempted to come back in September to see McGonagall’s face when she realises she only has a dozen NEWTS students.”</p><p align="justify">“Come now, Harry.” Despite his reproachful tone, his smile and the twinkle of mirth in his eye betrayed the laugh he was holding back. “She already has her hands full and does not deserve you laughing at her like this.”</p><p align="justify">“She’s whiskers-deep in troubles, you mean.”</p><p align="justify">They sat there, chuckling, content on enjoying their breakfast and view as more students woke up and came out of the castle to enjoy the first beautiful day after a long and dark winter.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry it ended like this.” Harry put down his empty cup, the last of the tasteful tea failing to wash away the bitterness nested in his throat and laced in his words. “That we couldn’t save you.”</p><p align="justify">“I am not.” Serenely, Dumbledore picked another scone. “I enjoyed a long and full life. And thankfully, so will you now.”</p><p align="justify">Unwilling to break the moment, Harry snuggled up in his scarf with a weak smile. Knowing his voice would crack and betray him, he instead looked down upon the grounds once more.</p><p align="justify">His first friends. His first kiss. His first death.</p><p align="justify">All the most memorable moments of his life had taken place here.</p><p align="justify">He had lived and died on these grounds. And now it was time to let them go.</p><p align="justify">“Will I ever see you again?”</p><p align="justify">“That is ... unlikely. We both have our own journeys to embark on, with very different destinations.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes...” Harry sighed. “I suppose so.”</p><p align="justify">“Then again...” Dumbledore smiled fondly. “You showed me just how vast and mysterious our universe truly is. How it keeps surprising us at every turn by making the impossible come true.”</p><p align="justify">“I could do without these surprises sometimes.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m sure you would.” Dumbledore chuckled.  “Yet we can only hope that fate will bring us together again.”</p><p align="justify">Abandoning the horizon, the sun rose in the sky, drowning the world in its warm embrace as it faded away.</p><p align="justify">“Goodbye, Harry. Live well.”</p><p align="justify">Harry opened his eyes to the dim light of the stars shining through the window of his room on the Requirement, tears streaming down his face as he sat up in his bed.</p><hr /><p align="justify">After a long and beautiful ceremony, the marble tomb was sealed with only a wand resting within.</p><p align="justify">The new Minister had hoped the event would help the country move on from the past year and her staff had spared no effort to rebuild the grounds and castle to prepare for it. Witches, Wizards, Goblins, Centaurs and Merepeople from every corner of Europe had come to pay their respects and witness Britain standing strong.</p><p align="justify">Yet, once the ceremony concluded, the sombre mood persisted.</p><p align="justify">After shaking one too many hands, Harry joined Sirius as he stood on the edge of the Black Lake, his gaze lost beyond the burnt husk of the Whomping Willow. Despite Bones granting him his freedom in the first days of her takeover and spreading the truth of his past far and wide, many who had not fought at Hogwarts still eyed him with suspicion and took offence to his presence.</p><p align="justify">“I spent the better part of my life fighting this war.” Sirius’ voice was dry and small. “Even in Azkaban, it was all I could think about. Peter. Your parents. The war.”</p><p align="justify">“And now it’s over.”</p><p align="justify">“Is it?” Sirius finally tore his eyes from the horizon to look at him. “Reading the prophet, you wouldn’t think so.”</p><p align="justify">“We’ve fought long enough. It’s time for others to clean up the mess now.”</p><p align="justify">“I’d ask when you became so jaded, but I know what you’ve been through.” Sirius said bitterly. “So, what now? You said you wouldn’t go back to Hogwarts, but you didn’t take Amelia’s offer.”</p><p align="justify">“No, I didn’t.”</p><p align="justify">“You’re welcome to stay at Grimmauld anyhow. It’s not the happiest place, but I’m sure we can liven it up a bit now that the Order won’t be using it.”</p><p align="justify">“About that ... I kind of made plans already.”</p><p align="justify">“Kid, I haven’t been here for you since James and Lily died.” Sirius scowled. “I’ve got a lot to make up for and I’m not gonna let you out of my sight until I do.”</p><p align="justify">“I figured as much.” A small smile tugged at the corner of Harry’s lips. ”And I thought of something that could interest you...”</p><hr /><p align="justify">“So, how did you get hired?”</p><p align="justify">“Walked into a Trekkie shop in Boston, two overexcited kids gave me a contract and shipped me wherever this is. Same as you, I take it?”</p><p align="justify">“Da. Though no kids in the Belgrade shop.”</p><p align="justify">Through Portkeys and vanishing cabinets, dozens of Witches and Wizards of various ages and nationalities had been gathered in a vast room made entirely of metal. The place looked more like something you would see in a Muggle amusement park than the proper wizarding business they had expected.</p><p align="justify">To their irritation, seeing a group of teenagers walk upon the stage with a large curtain behind it did nothing to dispel this image.</p><p align="justify">“Hello everyone.” Said the dark-haired kid standing in front of the others, marking a pause to let the hubbub die down. “I’d like to begin by thanking all of you for your patience with our recruitment process, I know some were not as understanding as you were.”</p><p align="justify">“Is this a joke?” A witch with a strong eastern-European accent shouted from the crowd. “We came here for a job, not to play house with a bunch of kids.”</p><p align="justify">“Just let him speak.” A man on the other side of the crowd shouted back.</p><p align="justify">“Thank you, Sirius. Now, I know you have a lot of questions—like where were are, or what the job you signed up for is—and we’ll get to that shortly. However, there are things you must understand first.”</p><p align="justify">The crowd settled, despite the grumbling of a few discontents.</p><p align="justify">“The journey you are about to embark on is one that will shape the future of everyone on Earth, hopefully for the better. However, our work here, and the very existence of our organisation need to be kept secret until the world is ready for us. It might take years, but I’m convinced that one day, we’ll bring our world into a new age. Until then, let me be the first to tell you...”</p><p align="justify">Behind the podium, the wide curtain vanished into a mist of little stars, revealing Neptune slowly turning in the depths of space. Orbiting close enough for them to see the familiar elongated Othila rune painted on its hull was the Requirement, displaying its new modifications proudly while crew members on hoverboards flew in formation around it.</p><p align="justify">“Welcome to the Defensive Space Force.”</p>
