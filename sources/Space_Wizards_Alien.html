  <strong>Book 2</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Alien Legacy</strong>
</p><p align="justify">"Space ... The final frontier."</p><p align="justify">Over a hundred light-years away from Earth, binary suns turned lazily around each other in a celestial dance that bathed the handful of planets surrounding them in their light.</p><p align="justify">Near one such planet, the tapestry of stars parted in a blinding flash of light, breaching the walls between reality and subspace to allow a ship to burst forth before disappearing.</p><p align="justify">"These are the voyages of the spaceship Requirement. Its ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds; to seek out new life and civilizations; to boldly go where no wizard—"</p><p align="justify">"I said no more references, Lee. The Muggles are gonna sue our arses off if they find out."</p><p align="justify">On the spaceship's bridge, a handful of teenagers busied themselves around large consoles covered in Nordic runes. They moved and turned rounded pearly stones on their smooth surfaces, piloting the ship and examining sensor data through the holographic displays projected in mid-air.</p><p align="justify">Such a scene would have been unthinkable a few years ago, yet so had been magic. And now, both had become integral parts of their lives.</p><p align="justify">"A bit late for that, Captain. A desert planet with two suns ... looks like we came out above Tatooine."</p><p align="justify">"We're so screwed..." Harry sighed. "Does it have a name or will I have to hear the same joke a hundred times today?"</p><p align="justify">"Surprisingly, it does." Angelina swiped on her data slate, sending the planet's information from the ship's previous visit to the main console's display. "Dakhla."</p><p align="justify">"Better odds than the last few planets, then." Harry sunk into his armchair, his gaze losing itself in the sight of the planet growing larger behind the window as they approached. "Malcolm, what do we have?"</p><p align="justify">"I think..." Malcolm Baddock, one of the youngest members of their crew, read out the ship's sensor data as they came in. "Jackpot! We got life signs and what I think is a city, Captain!"</p><p align="justify">"Finally." Ron's voice followed the bridge's door opening. "Not that I was getting bored of exploring empty planets—because who'd get bored of that?—but come on."</p><p align="justify">"So a spaceship with technology thousands of years beyond us and interstellar travel isn't enough for you?"</p><p align="justify">"I was promised aliens. And so far? Not impressed."</p><p align="justify">While they had yet to encounter any intelligent alien life, it was not for a lack of trying. Their exploration had so far been fruitless in locating any life beyond plants and the occasional animal. And while these discoveries were amazing on their own, a certain restlessness had taken root amongst the crew in the few weeks since they had left Earth for the first time.</p><p align="justify">Sure, weird plants and animals were great and their experts were fascinated by how similar they were to their Earth counterparts despite the obvious differences. However, it paled in comparison to the advanced alien civilization they were looking for.</p><p align="justify">Unfortunately, the one place where they knew they would find these aliens, Requirement's original home planet, was ridiculously out of reach. While the Helium-3 reactors and the capacitors they had installed allowed them to operate the ship's main systems, their generation capabilities were far lesser than the ship was designed for.</p><p align="justify">Forget the alien's home galaxy, any use of the more power-hungry systems like the weapons or the hyperdrive drained their reserves faster than a Niffler would a bank vault.</p><p align="justify">With their most obvious destination unattainable, they now embarked on a journey throughout the Milky Way, retracing Requirement's original flight path in search of technologies or resources that would help them unlock the full potential of their ship.</p><p align="justify">And now, finally, they would meet with the people of another world for the first time. This was the moment they had been waiting for since discovering this ship, nearly two years ago.</p><p align="justify">"So." Harry pushed himself up from the Captain's chair, grinning at everyone's expectant faces. "Who's coming?"</p><hr /><p align="justify">"Ok, try it now."</p><p align="justify">Ginny flicked a few switches and grasped the controls as the lights and displays all around her came to life with a purr. She pulled on the handles and the floor shook for an instant before the shuttle rose a meter into the air.</p><p align="justify">Turning the controls, Ginny brought the shuttle up and around in a wide turn. Taking her time to make sure everything worked as intended, she got a good view of the wide storage room they had retrofitted into a hangar.</p><p align="justify">Spare parts and unfinished prototypes were scattered around while cauldrons filled with a simmering blue liquid were lined up against the far wall, frost growing on their edges and everywhere their fumes touched. Tucked in a corner, Hermione's desk—made up of three separate desks she had stuck together—sagged under the weight of tomes, half-dismantled engines and rolls of parchments covered in notes.</p><p align="justify">As one would expect, one of the hangar's walls had been removed entirely and replaced by a shield. Based on a technology similar to the one used for windows across the ship, it had been modified to allow ships to pass through.</p><p align="justify">How such a field could do this while still keeping the air in was a mystery to Ginny, though she had long stopped any attempt at understanding how these alien machines worked. As far as she was concerned, that stuff was more unnatural than Muggles made magic out to be. Fortunately, she could leave the science part to Hermione and her team while she focused on the fun part like piloting this sweet little bird.</p><p align="justify">"All systems in the green and holding. I think we've got it."</p><p align="justify">"Thank God." Hermione sighed, the weight of the sleepless night she had spent reworking her designs clear even through the shuttle's speakers. "And not a moment too soon."</p><p align="justify">On the far end of the hangar, Harry had come in with more than half a dozen people, all decked out in the most recent generation of armoured suits.</p><p align="justify">While this new model was as form-fitting as ever, the undersuit was now padded and the bulky armour reminiscent of those displayed in Hogwarts had been replaced by dozens of smaller interlocking plates. This resulted in a far sleeker and less intimidating look, with the added benefit of leaving behind the medieval fashion and overly revealing parts.</p><p align="justify">That last point was something Lavender, who dearly loved her quartermaster position and never failed to remind them of it, had insisted upon when she was brought onto the project. Never one to back down from a fashion challenge, she had taken charge of the designs, leaving the Weasley twins in charge of the production and technical aspects.</p><p align="justify">While the crew had unanimously welcomed the more modern designs—futuristic was a word that quickly lost its appeal when you lived on a spaceship—more than one voice had raised complaints about losing their house colours.</p><p align="justify">However, with the arrival of so many new recruits, plenty of which originated from across the Channel and the Atlantic, the Hogwarts associations had been abandoned in favour of more practical colour schemes. To Harry's misery, Lavender had been initiated by her peers to popular science fiction shows, inspiring her to decorate the black undersuit and white armoured parts with coloured accents representing the wearer's role in the organization.</p><p align="justify">While Ginny and the rest of the people coming in the hangar wore suits marked with red and blue identifying them as members of the combat and science divisions respectively, the deep purple lines decorating Harry's made him stand out like a sore thumb. Many an argument were had between Harry and Lavender, though she never budged on her position that the captain should be unique and recognizable.</p><p align="justify">And despite his complaints and orders to have his suit be the same as the others, the colours always turned purple after a time. Although that's the kind of thing one should expect with the twins in charge of producing their equipment.</p><p align="justify">With the shuttle landed, Ginny turned off the power and came down the ramp opened in the back of the passenger's compartment. Before she could even put a foot on it, however, Ron, Angelina and Lee rushed past her and into the ship, talking animatedly as they brought necessary supplies onboard. Zacharias, Justin and Terry came up after them, though at a more sedate pace.</p><p align="justify">While Justin and Terry shared the others' enthusiasm, Zacharias kept to himself a few steps behind, preferring instead to grace Ginny with a scornful glare as they crossed paths.</p><p align="justify">Rather than cause a scene she wanted no part of, she gritted her teeth and pointedly did not look at him as she came down.</p><p align="justify">She didn't need him to spit back at her everything she already said to herself every day.</p><p align="justify">"Well done up there." Harry greeted her with a large grin while Sirius fussed over the shuttle's wings. "For a moment I thought you'd capsize on the descent."</p><p align="justify">"Har, har, very funny. We can't all be prodigies the moment we learn to fly."</p><p align="justify">"And it's not like it would be a problem." Hermione walked up to them with her dark circles under her eyes and hair more frazzled than usual. "The artificial gravity would keep everyone inside on their seats. You can go as wild as you want."</p><p align="justify">"Really?" Ginny raised an eyebrow, her mind filled with all the stunts she had thought of since she first sat in the pilot chair.</p><p align="justify">"No." Hermione sagged. "Please take it slow. This is still the first flight in real conditions."</p><p align="justify">"I could take the wheel if you want," Sirius called out from atop one of the wings, earning himself a dirty look from Hermione. "It can't be that different from my motorcycle."</p><p align="justify">"Of course it is. This is a spaceship, not some old enchanted bike. It relies on the laws of physics and not dubious charms."</p><p align="justify">"Just because you're pants on a broom doesn't mean magical means are unreliable." Harry said jokingly.</p><p align="justify">"I prefer when the thing keeping me in the air can't throw me off because it's having a tantrum, thank you very much." Hermione huffed as she watched Sirius jump back down. "Anyway, Ginny has been the test pilot since the first prototype and she's already quite familiar with the controls. You're in good hands with her."</p><p align="justify">And that familiarity would be sorely needed. While calculating coordinates and inputting them into the navigation console to let it plot a course by itself worked well for a large ship like Requirement, it was hardly suited for smaller ships. For a shuttle this size, intended to operate both in space on inside a planet's atmosphere, quick and precise manoeuvres could make all the difference between life and death. Months had been spent working on the navigation controls alone, building them from scratch as no suitable alternative could be found in the Requirement's database.</p><p align="justify">"Fine, have it your way..." Sirius said, feigning disappointment before perking right back up. "I'm definitely taking it out for a ride next time, though."</p><p align="justify">"In your dreams. I'm next in line" Harry shot back. "There has to be some perks if I have to be the Captain."</p><p align="justify">Seeing them joke around like that rid Ginny of the last of the annoyance clinging at the back of her mind and she laughed at Sirius' pout. The last days of the war had been hard for everyone and it had taken months before anyone dared to break the sombre mood that had fallen on the crew, despite Fred and George's best efforts.</p><p align="justify">They would carry the scars of these days their whole life, and some still had trouble sleeping through the night after the horrors they had faced, but now they could at least look toward the future.</p><p align="justify">"You're sure you don't want to come with us?" Harry asked Hermione. "I'm sure we could make room for you."</p><p align="justify">"We could always kick Ron out if we need." Ginny added, impishly.</p><p align="justify">"Oi!" A shout came out from inside the shuttle "Don't you even try!"</p><p align="justify">"No thanks." Hermione shook her head. "I'll be monitoring your progress from here and collect some data. Besides, Lee and Terry should be able to handle any problem."</p><p align="justify">For a moment, they all looked at her pointedly, not saying a word.</p><p align="justify">"Not that anything will go wrong, of course." She quickly added.</p><hr /><p align="justify">Despite the apprehension born from Hermione's parting words, the shuttle left Requirement's hangar without any trouble and began its descent toward the planet.</p><p align="justify">All in all, the ride was a smooth one. The seats were of a more modern design than the Hogwarts chairs they had replicated for Requirement, yet just as comfortable. Thanks to the inertial dampeners, the slight tremor of the floor every time Ginny corrected their course that accompanied the soft purr of the engine could have lulled a baby to sleep, despite the uneasiness it brought to those accustomed to flying a broom or hoverboard.</p><p align="justify">"We'll pass into the atmosphere shortly."</p><p align="justify">"Great." Harry gave a small tap on the back of Ginny's seat as he got up. "I'll go see how the kids are doing."</p><p align="justify">Separated from the cockpit by a short storage room, the walls of the passengers' area were lined by two padded benches and over-the-shoulder harnesses.</p><p align="justify">The excitement in the compartment was palpable, the laughs and conversations of everyone echoing in the entire shuttle. They had waited for this moment for two years now and they would be the first to see it unfold. Even Sirius couldn't hold in place, despite only having been among them for a few months.</p><p align="justify">And yet, Harry could all too easily see the doubts and apprehension lurking just beneath the surface. Tense shoulders and smiles; hands grasping at the harnesses just a bit too tightly; looks that never strayed too far from their wands, as if to make sure they were still here...</p><p align="justify">Their scars and Zacharias' missing forearm were not the only parts of the war they carried with them still.</p><p align="justify">Though they had travelled light-years away from Earth, a part of them yet remained buried there with Ernie, Remus and all those they had lost.</p><p align="justify">That wouldn't do.</p><p align="justify">Relaxing the tight grasp he had over the edge of the door and forcing a smile to come to his lips, Harry stepped into the compartment.</p><p align="justify">"So, what do you all think we'll find?"</p><p align="justify">"I'm betting on Roswell Greys," Justin said. "Though I'll be happy with anything as long as they're friendly."</p><p align="justify">"Whoever they are, I doubt they're as advanced as the Muggles back on Earth." Terry piped up. "We didn't detect any satellites in orbit, much less any ships."</p><p align="justify">"They're in for a shock then." Ron joined in. "Life from another world knocking at their door. Hopefully, we won't have to explain magic too."</p><p align="justify">"Oh, come on. That's the best part!" Sirius interjected. "It's always a treat to introduce Muggles to magic."</p><p align="justify">"I don't think it's a coincidence that the first planet with intelligent life we've come across is also the first on our list that's marked in the ship's database with the strange runes." Angelina said, her eyes never leaving the data-slate she had taken with her. "And if there is an actual correlation, we'll be able to considerably reduce the scope of our exploration."</p><p align="justify">While studying Requirement's original flight path and records, Angelina's team discovered some rather strange things. The ship visited thousands of life-bearing planets that, according to Muggle and Magical astronomers alike, should not exist. Stranger still, those planets were all identified in the database by a series of runes unlike any encountered on the ship before.</p><p align="justify">As if redefining everything they knew about science and meeting aliens wasn't enough, they now had mysteries about the very origin of life in the galaxy to investigate.</p><p align="justify">Harry was so glad he was still here to see it through. This was going to be fun.</p><p align="justify">Small tremors ran across the ship and a quick look above his shoulder showed Harry that the planet was now the only thing visible through the canopy as Ginny took them into the atmosphere.</p><p align="justify">"The inertial dampeners are having a hard time with the re-entry." Ginny called out from the cockpit. "It's gonna be a bit bumpy until we break through."</p><p align="justify">"One thing's for sure," Ron frowned as he and the others grabbed onto their harnesses to steady themselves. "I'm not looking forward to the walk through the desert. I did it once when I went to Egypt and it's not as fun as they make it out to be."</p><p align="justify">"As long as there's no giant worms under the dunes, I'll be happy." Lee said through chattering teeth as the turbulence intensified.</p><p align="justify">"I'm sure Ginny will find us a nice spot with plenty of shade near the city." Harry tried to reassure them, though the effect was diminished by the fervour with which he held on to the handles affixed on the ceiling.</p><p align="justify">"If she doesn't kill us all first." Zacharias muttered loud enough to be heard, despite the commotion.</p><p align="justify">Before Harry could reprimand him, the purring of the shuttle's engines that had accompanied them since they took off ceased and a sensation of weightlessness overtook him.</p><p align="justify">Time stood still for an instant.</p><p align="justify">Everyone in the compartment exchanged looks of panic as they realised what was happening.</p><p align="justify">"Merlin's saggy-"</p><p align="justify">"We've lost the main engines!" Ginny screamed.</p><p align="justify">Suddenly, they were falling. Cries of panic filled the shuttle as they grabbed onto their harness for dear life while Harry was hurled against the ceiling.</p><p align="justify">"Depulso!"</p><p align="justify">Before he could feel the impact he was bracing himself for, Ron's quick thinking sent Harry flying back into the cockpit.</p><p align="justify">Twisting in the air as if to apparate, Harry caught onto the copilot seat and pulled himself down on it before securing his harness.</p><p align="justify">"What the hell happened?"</p><p align="justify">"I don't know!" Ginny shouted back to be heard above the panicked cries from the rest of the team. "We were almost through when the engines died and I can't restart them!"</p><p align="justify">"Can you land this thing?"</p><p align="justify">"I'm trying!" Ginny bit back as she wrestled with the controls, flicking a few switches on the console to extend the wings' manoeuvering flaps. "It's not gonna be pretty, though."</p><p align="justify">"Right ... Helmets on, everyone!" Harry shouted toward the back of the ship as he put on his own. "We're going in!"</p><p align="justify">With some skilful manoeuvring, their fall turned into a bumpy glide which brought back some semblance of control over their fate. Despite Ginny's best efforts, their speed kept increasing, however, and they streaked above the desert and a city of yellow and white stone.</p><p align="justify">Harry didn't have time to enjoy the view, unfortunately, as he was more preoccupied with his attempts to send a distress message back to Requirement.</p><p align="justify">"—engines have failed and we have lost control. We are going in; Repeat, we are going—"</p><p align="justify">"Brace yourselves!"</p><p align="justify">The shuttle bounced back off the dunes, sending it spinning and throwing them against their harness in what Harry's errand thought compared to a theme park ride from hell. He lost count of how many times they hit the sand, the world beyond his seat melting away as he shut his eyes in an effort to lessen his throbbing headache and the pain of the harness biting into his shoulders.</p><p align="justify">They crashed into the last dune and the shuttle slid down its slope, its nose burying itself into the sand.</p><p align="justify">The ship had stopped moving, yet it remained inclined downward, sending everything that wasn't bolted down falling toward the canopy. Speaking off, while the window had survived the crash, it was now entirely buried. The only lights saving him from complete darkness were those of the console, and their flickering was not exactly reassuring.</p><p align="justify">While the simple fact that he was still breathing was a relief, it took a few minutes for the world to stop spinning and for the ringing in his ears to fade.</p><p align="justify">Unstrapping himself, he got up and carefully removed Ginny's harness. She was out cold, sprawled across the main console, but he could feel still a pulse beat under her suit. The pained moans and groans he heard above him also reassured him that everyone had gotten out of it without any serious injury.</p><p align="justify">Closing his eyes, Harry took deep, slow breaths to calm his beating heart and trembling hands.</p><p align="justify">Despite the universe's best efforts to the contrary, they were alive. There wasn't anything to fear.</p><p align="justify">There weren't any Death Eaters lying in wait, ready to pounce on them the moment they opened the door.</p><p align="justify">This had been an accident. A simple mistake while building the shuttle. Something they could fix.</p><p align="justify">Voldemort was gone and none of his schemes had survived him.</p><p align="justify">The scrapes and bruises would heal and the fear would fade, leaving only memories they would laugh about while drinking butterbeer once they got back to the ship.</p><p align="justify">Everything was fine.</p><p align="justify">"Harry? Ginny?" Ron's voice called out above him. "You alright down there?"</p><p align="justify">Harry let go of his breath, opening his eyes where determination shone once more.</p><p align="justify">"I'm good. But I'm gonna need your help."</p><hr /><p align="justify">Carefully, Harry and Ron sat Ginny's unconscious body against the shuttle, taking care not to hit her head on the metal surface. She had yet to wake up, and given the large dent on her helmet, each passing moment saw their worries grow.</p><p align="justify">Removing her helmet, Harry brushed her hair back from her face, finding nothing but freckled skin, unmarred by the blow the suit had endured. Despite their love of pranks, the twins did not joke around with the quality of their products.</p><p align="justify">He'd have to thank them once they got back.</p><p align="justify">Climbing out of the ship and down the dune, the rest of the team joined them under what little shade the wreck provided, grateful to have once again a more or less solid ground under their feet. While the others composed themselves, or disgorged what remained of their breakfast in a corner in Justin's case, Let and Terry had remained under the scorching suns to examine the dead engine.</p><p align="justify">"I knew it!" Their respite came to an end when Zacharias stumbled down the dune, his words laced with rage. "I knew this would happen! How could you let her pilot after all she's done?"</p><p align="justify">"Stand down, Smith." Getting up, Harry positioned himself between him and Ginny. "She's the one that saved us."</p><p align="justify">"Without her, we wouldn't have needed saving in the first place!"</p><p align="justify">"I said stand down."</p><p align="justify">They stood there, waiting for the other to make the first move.</p><p align="justify">Angelina stopped Sirius from stepping in while Ron remained close to Ginny, his wand in hand and the others took a step back, anxious as they watched and ready to step in.</p><p align="justify">"It was a mechanical error," Lee called out from atop the wreck, his hands still buried in the ship's inner parts. "The freezing draught burned out during the re-entry and the engines shut down when they overheated. There was nothing she could have done."</p><p align="justify">"I know this was a close call, and we're still shaken." Harry looked at everyone present, his thankful gaze lingering on Lee as he kept Zacharias well in sight. "But this would have happened regardless of who the pilot was."</p><p align="justify">Despite the rebuttal, Zacharias' ire did not dull. Standing tall, standing firm despite the tense atmosphere and Justin's knowing look, his hand remained poised to seize his wand.</p><p align="justify">With slow and deliberate movements, Harry stepped forward. He closed the distance between them and put a hand on Zacharia's shoulder, sensing him tense up under his touch.</p><p align="justify">"I know you can't forgive her for what happened," Harry spoke softly, keeping his weariness of an argument too often revisited out of his voice. "but this isn't the time or place to do this."</p><p align="justify">"And when will that be?" Zacharias muttered bitterly. "After her recklessness gets another one of us killed?"</p><p align="justify">"That wasn't—" Harry caught himself before he could raise his voice. No need to add fuel to the fire. "I promise you I won't let that happen. For now, can't you accept that she saved us and that we got more pressing things to deal with?"</p><p align="justify">"Fine." Zacharias stepped back and out of his grasp, his scowl still firmly in place. "On your head be it, Potter."</p><p align="justify">With the fear of a brawl passed, the others relaxed and went back to what they were doing, although they kept their voices low and worriedly looked above their shoulders from time to time.</p><p align="justify">Harry sighed as he watched Zacharias walk away and Justin join him. This was a far cry from how he had expected their first mission to go, but it seemed on par for the course of his life.</p><p align="justify">When they left Earth and the war behind, he had hoped that things would calm down. That they could focus on exploring and having fun without dragging along the grudge of the past and having to be the mediator for every little thing.</p><p align="justify">Had he known he would have to deal with all of this when they first found the ship, he would have ran for the hills when the others pushed the captaincy onto him.</p><p align="justify">Yet, despite everything, they had come out of this alive and mostly uninjured. Sure, the shuttle wouldn't fly anytime soon and the sooner he could get Ginny back in Requirement's infirmary, the better, but it could have gone much worse.</p><p align="justify">"So!" Harry exclaimed, getting everyone's attention. "How do we do this?"</p><p align="justify">"Do what?" Angelina asked with an inquisitive eyebrow raised.</p><p align="justify">"Make contact with the locals. We've come all this way, it'd be a waste to pack it up at the first bump on the road."</p><p align="justify">It took a minute for the others to get back some of their excitement, the shock of the crash dissipating as the prospect of first contact with aliens brought back animated discussions.</p><p align="justify">"We can't just show up on their doorstep."</p><p align="justify">"Why not? It'd be the polite thing to do."</p><p align="justify">"To them, we're the aliens. We risk frightening them."</p><p align="justify">"I think we're past that point already. Our crash was hard to miss, especially since we flew over their city on the way down."</p><p align="justify">"All the more reason to appear as peaceful as possible. We've made for a dreadful first impression"</p><p align="justify">"Not the worst we could have done. At least we didn't park Requirement right above their city."</p><p align="justify">"Speaking of, we should really let them know we're ok."</p><p align="justify">"And what do we do with the shuttle? Leave it here?"</p><p align="justify">"This mess isn't going anywhere. Worst-case scenario, we'll pick it up late with the ship."</p><p align="justify">"Can't we fix it?"</p><p align="justify">"Doubtful. Even if we had more freezing draught for the cooling system, some of the parts melted together. It's gonna need a lot of work."</p><p align="justify">"Maybe the locals will be able to help."</p><p align="justify">"From what I saw of their city, I doubt it." Ginny groaned behind them, silencing them in surprise as they turned to see her as she massaged her temples.</p><p align="justify">In a breath, Harry was kneeling beside her.</p><p align="justify">"You ok?"</p><p align="justify">"Yeah..." She smiled weakly. "Just don't ask me to do that again."</p><p align="justify">"We need to get her back to the ship." Ron came up to them. "Have Swansforth examine her."</p><p align="justify">"No." She shook her head, regretting it immediately with a wince. "I've come this far, I'm not going back now." Leaning on the shuttle's wreck, she stood up, stopping Harry from supporting her when she stumbled. Finding her balance, she took a few steps and looked around. "So, which way do we go?"</p><p align="justify">"I'd say this way is a safe bet." Sirius spared her a worried look before pointing above the opposing dune, where the golden tip of a giant structure could be seen gleaming in the distance.</p><p align="justify">"Let's just hope we haven't spooked them too much."</p><hr /><p align="justify">Even with the help of their suits, crossing the desert had been a brutal endeavour, made that much harder by the second sun bearing down on them. By climbing one last dune, their journey had come to an end and brought with it their promised reward of civilisation and fresh water. And yet, instead of rushing to the cold embrace of the first building they could find, the group stood atop the dune, transfixed by what they saw.</p><p align="justify">"We're sure this isn't Earth, right?" Ron asked.</p><p align="justify">"Pretty sure," Terry painstakingly answered as he helped Justin climb the last few meters to the dune's summit. "Considering the hundred light-years we crossed and the two suns above our heads."</p><p align="justify">"Ok. So why does it look like we just landed in ancient Egypt?"</p><p align="justify">Where they had been expecting a strange and alien city, the scenery offered to them was one that would have been at home in an archaeology book.</p><p align="justify">Their vantage point gave them an astonishing view of three intersecting rivers, impossible sources of life in a land of death that let plants and animals flourish in their wake. Bountiful fields filled with wheat, fruit-heavy trees and vegetables stretched as far as the eye could see. Large groups of people and caravans of large and hairy beasts walked the roads along the fields, converging toward the city.</p><p align="justify">And the city ... A forest of tents and stalls gradually gave way to increasingly grand and colourful stone buildings, the white base of their walls glowing under the suns and forming a shining halo surrounding the colossal pyramid erected in its centre. The wondrous monument was painted a white so pure that merely looking at it and its gold-plated summit was blinding, yet those brave enough to dare could make out the stylised—almost bird-like—shape of an eye engraved onto its sides.</p><p align="justify">"That's impossible..." Angelina breathed out.</p><p align="justify">"Don't these people look a bit too ... Humans to you?" Zacharias asked as he peered down the valley, using his hands to shield his eyes from the suns.</p><p align="justify">"Two arms, two legs, a head full of hair ... Yup. Definitely humans. With some nice specimens too ... And some really ugly beasts." Sirius remarked as he examined the caravans through a set of Omniculars, his gaze following certain figures more than others. "Did we go back in time?"</p><p align="justify">"Merlin, I hope not." Lee groaned. "I can't deal with a butterfly effect right now."</p><p align="justify">"Only one way to know for sure." Harry said as he took the first step down the slope. "Helmets off, everyone. We don't want to spook them."</p><p align="justify">As they climbed down the dune, their approach did not go unnoticed. Unrest grew in the masses below and by the time they had reached the first tents, dozens had gathered, led by a group of men in white robes arrived from the wealthier parts of the city.</p><p align="justify">Seeing them this close dispelled any lingering doubts as to the nature of these people. They were humans. Not even human-shaped aliens with weird nose-ridges or ears like you could see in the TV shows Lee loved so much, but as human as any of them.</p><p align="justify">Actual humans. A hundred light years from Earth.</p><p align="justify">What few clothes they wore were simple; sandals, kilts, and sleeveless dresses of rough fabrics were adorned with pearls or feathers that clashed against the full-body suits of the newcomers.</p><p align="justify">"Hello—"</p><p align="justify">Harry's greeting died in his throat when the sea of people in from of him fell to the ground in prostration, striking him and his companions speechless. Those wearing white robes, led by a man who looked older than even Dumbledore, bowed deeply yet stayed standing while their leader stepped forward.</p><p align="justify">"Welcome, messengers of the gods! We have eagerly awaited your return."</p><p align="justify">"Our ... return?"</p><p align="justify">"Yes!" The elder's enthusiasm was not diminished by his hesitation. "We have prayed each day for Ra's return, and he has rewarded our faith!" Ignoring or not noticing the incredulous looks shared by the supposed messengers, the man turned to his people with a fervour that betrayed his apparent age. "The envoys of the sun god have come down from the sky to bless us once more!"</p><p align="justify">This was all wrong.</p><p align="justify">They had come to meet aliens; To exchange their knowledge and cultures, not pose as gods to a lost human tribe, or whatever this was!</p><p align="justify">Curiosity, fear, confusion, hostility ... Those he could have dealt with and even understood.</p><p align="justify">But this?</p><p align="justify">"I think there's been a mistake here. You shouldn't ... We're not..."</p><p align="justify">His words failed him as the sheer size of the crowd prostrated before him overwhelmed him. It seemed to go on as far as the eye could see, straight out of some of his worst nightmares.</p><p align="justify">Tearing themselves from this spectacle, his eyes desperately searched for Justin's, pleading.</p><p align="justify">Stepping forward, Justin cleared his throat, a gleam in his eyes.</p><p align="justify">"Good people of Dakhla! We have come a long way—"</p><hr /><p align="justify">"So this Ra used to come here? You've seen him yourself?"</p><p align="justify">"Of course. Though these blessed times ended many moons ago. And when the head priest left with his guards, we grew worried that we had somehow offended the gods. But as you can see, we never wavered in our devotion."</p><p align="justify">Kherun—as they now knew the elderly man—led them into the city, enthusiastically pointing out the many statues and monuments along the way while answering Justin's questions. The rest of them walked a few steps back, observing the city and its people as they observed them. Their procession had gathered no small amount of onlookers, many falling to their knees and muttering prayers in their wake.</p><p align="justify">"This is gonna grow old quick." Ginny said as yet another group came out of a back street and threw themselves to the ground.</p><p align="justify">"It already has." Harry grumbled, trying his hardest to ignore the dozens of people lining the streets.</p><p align="justify">"Oh, lighten up." Sirius did not seem overly bothered by the situation and gleefully waved at the crowd. "Sure, we'll need to clear things up, but at least they're friendly."</p><p align="justify">"You can say that again." Lee greedily drank from the waterskin the locals had offered them.</p><p align="justify">"It's hard to blame them." Terry piped up "To them, our technology must look like some kind of divine magic."</p><p align="justify">"Still, I don't like that we're lying to them." Harry said, making sure none of the locals was close enough to hear. "This isn't right."</p><p align="justify">"We'll tell them who we are later." Zacharias replied. "There's too much we don't know, and we have better chances at getting answers if they think we're gods or whatever."</p><p align="justify">The closer they got to the city's centre and the pyramid, the more elaborate and opulent the buildings became. Hovels of dirt and wood gave way to grand stone buildings covered in colourful murals, their entrances guarded by statues. Seeing it from a distance had been one thing, walking through it and seeing these people was another entirely.</p><p align="justify">If not for the two suns shining high in the sky, Harry would have started to believe in the time travel idea.</p><p align="justify">But if this was the present, how did these people end up so far away from Earth? And why were they living according to a culture that had died out a thousand years ago?</p><p align="justify">And while Harry was far from an expert on ancient Egypt, he was pretty sure that their faith was quite varied, with dozens of funny-looking gods he remembered laughing at in the picture books Dudley had thrown away.</p><p align="justify">Every statue or mural they had passed so far depicted a falcon or a man with a falcon's head wearing a large round headset circled by a snake. And from what he understood of Angelina and Zacharias' excited rambling in the back of the procession, the symbol carved on the sides of the central pyramid was the Eye of Ra.</p><p align="justify">The opulent offerings placed under every statue they passed and the ramblings of their guide painted them as a devout people, yet why worship a single god? The two suns maybe?</p><p align="justify">"You know, when we left Earth I thought we'd get to visit alien cities with flying cars, teleporters and stuff like that. Not travel back to the dark ages." Ron broke his silence, his gaze examining every inch of the buildings around them as if searching for something. "It's weird."</p><p align="justify">"There are too many similarities with ancient Egypt for it to be a coincidence." Zacharias pointed out. "I don't know what it means yet, but this is huge."</p><p align="justify">"Sure, it looks similar, but..." Ron turned to Ginny, frowning "You noticed, right?"</p><p align="justify">"Yeah." She looked around, her expression quickly mirroring her brother's. "There's no writings. No hieroglyphs anywhere."</p><p align="justify">"Back on Earth, important stone buildings like this were covered in symbols." Ron answered Harry's questioning look. "Every wall was like a book. Hermione would have loved it." A dopey smile came to his lips before the frown came back in full force as he glared at the pyramid towering above the city. "And those were built away from the city."</p><p align="justify">"They're like big tombs for kings, built away from the city and surrounded by cemeteries." Ginny continued, dredging up memories of their trip, years ago. "It shouldn't be here."</p><p align="justify">"I'm not sure it's even a tomb." Angelina wondered as they emerged in an immense square with dozens of statues sprinkled around, their impressive size dwarfed by the pyramid erected in its centre. "It's clearly the heart of their religious activities. Maybe it's a temple?"</p><p align="justify">"Well, whatever it is," Harry said. "we're about to find out."</p><p align="justify">Kherun took some time to show off the most impressive statues in a not-so-subtle attempt to gain their approval before leading them into the pyramid itself. They passed through many antechambers and rooms full of treasures and offerings, amassed in the hope of placating their god. After dragging Ron by the scruff of his neck out of one such room when his fingers twitched a bit too much at the sight of the gold jewellery, they arrived at what their guide had hinted to be the largest and most important room.</p><p align="justify">And seeing it with his own eyes, Harry easily shared that belief.</p><p align="justify">"The Chappa'ai of Ra!" Kherun exclaimed devotedly. "See how we have tended to this most holy relic."</p><p align="justify">Against the far wall and set on a raised platform covered with offerings and steps leading to it, was a dark-grey metal ring, large enough for a car to go through. While the outer track was decorated by engraving and housed chevrons encased with orange crystals at regular intervals, the inner track was filled with familiar symbols.</p><p align="justify">Not too far from the platform, a round pedestal of the same dark grey material stood directly in front of the ring. Its top part was covered in button-like plates engraved with the same mysterious runes as the ring and arranged around a large red crystal polished into a half-sphere.</p><p align="justify">"Okay." Terry whistled in appreciation. "That is definitely not Egyptian. Nor human, for that matter."</p><p align="justify">"I think we can safely say we've found what we were looking for." Harry agreed, unable to look away from the device.</p><p align="justify">"More than you may think." Zacharias said as he walked away from the group and knelt before a wall. "Look here."</p><p align="justify">So surprised were they by the imposing alien relic that none besides him had noticed the hieroglyphs covering the walls of the chamber from floor to ceiling.</p><p align="justify">"Can you read it?" Harry asked as the others spread out around the chamber, to the delight of their host. "This might be the one chance we have of getting some answers here."</p><p align="justify">"We can certainly try." Angelina walked up to Zacharias, taking out her data-slate. "Professor Babbling broached the subject in our last year, but we moved on quickly. It'd certainly help if we had a point of reference."</p><p align="justify">"Kherun?" Harry called out their guide, his face strained in a smile. "Could you help my friends read what's written here, please?"</p><p align="justify">"Read?" Fear shock twisted Kherun's enthusiastic expression. After exchanging worried glances with his followers, he answered in a cautious tone. "Forgive me, exalted one, but the knowledge of these symbols is reserved for the gods. We could not possibly know what they mean."</p><p align="justify">"You don't know?" Harry frowned. "Then do you have any writing we could use as a reference? Any book or scroll would do."</p><p align="justify">Something seemed to click in Kherun's mind and his large grin came back.</p><p align="justify">"We do not, my lord. Please be assured that none among us have defied the edicts of Ra in his absence. We would never engage in such sacrilegious activities."</p><p align="justify">"You ..." Rendered speechless, it was Harry's turn to exchange worried looks with his team. "I see. That's good. You have done well." Harry tried to keep his growing worries bottled up and a semblance of confidence in his voice. "Can you tell me what this Chappa'ai is, then?"</p><p align="justify">"Of course!" Convinced that he had passed some kind of test, Kherun's excitement returned in full. "It is through it that Ra brought our people here, many generations ago. Our people were chosen before all others of the Tau'ri to serve him and inhabit his domain."</p><p align="justify">That ... was concerning.</p><p align="justify">After everything he had seen, Harry did not believe for one second that this "Ra" was anything but an alien with advanced technology. And if this Taur'i was what he thought it was, this "god" had visited Earth, thousands of years ago, and taken human slaves back with him.</p><p align="justify">Hell, if this had been going on for so long, there might be humans across the entire galaxy by now. It's not like there was a lack of alien abduction stories back on Earth.</p><p align="justify">The adoration and eagerness he could see on Kherun's beaming face reminded him far too much of Dobby's the first time he met him. Nothing he could say here would shake this man's faith.</p><p align="justify">But if this ring was some sort of transportation device, they needed to examine it. It might be the key to many of their problems.</p><p align="justify">They needed to know more. About this device, about these people and most importantly, about this god of theirs.</p><p align="justify">"Kherun. You've been a great help so far and we're thankful for your hospitality. Could you show us more of your city while some of my people pay their respects to the Chappa'ai? We'd like to make sure everything is in order."</p><p align="justify">"Of course, of course!" Kherun exclaimed. "Right this way, exalted one."</p><p align="justify">As the others began to vacate the chamber, Harry stayed behind with Angelina, Zacharias, Lee and Terry.</p><p align="justify">"I want to know what this is, how it works and who this Ra is. But more than anything, be careful." Harry told them quietly before he looked over his shoulder at the two guards who remained at the door. "We may not have much time before they understand we're not who they think we are."</p><p align="justify">"You got it." Lee smiled mischievously. "You couldn't pry me away from this thing anyway. I only got a quick look, but it's completely different from anything we've seen on Requirement."</p><p align="justify">"I'll look over them." Ginny stepped in. "It beats walking around in this heat."</p><p align="justify">"Are you sure?" From the corner of his eye, Harry watched as Zacharias examined one of the hieroglyph-covered columns, unaware of their discussion.</p><p align="justify">"Yeah." She smiled weakly, her expression strained with pain and weariness. "Sitting down while they work sounds fantastic right about now."</p><p align="justify">Oh how much he wished he could just whisk her away and strap her onto one of the infirmary beds. But captain or not, she would never let him.</p><p align="justify">"Alright. We'll keep in touch."</p><hr /><p align="justify">With the others and their chaperons out of their hair and back to their visit of the city, the researchers or the group could finally get some real work done.</p><p align="justify">Figuring out that the pedestal was a control panel for the ring did not take long, as pushing any of the "keys" on the device lit up one of the ring's chevrons. Similarly, Terry determined that the big red crystal served either as a confirmation or reset command—or possibly both—as pressing it powered the ring down.</p><p align="justify">And yet, despite this apparent simplicity of function, none of the symbol combinations they entered succeeded in activating the device. No matter the order or how many of the thirty-nine symbols they pressed, the ring would eventually power down.</p><p align="justify">While Terry continued to research the symbols and what code could possibly unlock the device, Lee was having a field day analysing its composition and inner workings.</p><p align="justify">The ring and the pedestal were almost entirely made out of an unknown element the likes of which was never seen on Earth. Every time a combination was confirmed on the pedestal, a massive surge of energy would course through the ring before dissipating, seemingly originating from the pedestal. The potential of a power source this small and powerful was invaluable and yet when Lee opened the back of the pedestal, the array of crystals he discovered had him at a loss.</p><p align="justify">Across the chamber, Angelina and Zacharias were not having any more luck deciphering the literal writings on the walls.</p><p align="justify">The dialect used here was completely different from what Angelina remembered from her studies, though that was to be expected. Languages changed a lot in a short amount of time and Egyptian hieroglyphs were among those that had changed the most during the thousands of years they were used. Being separated from Earth for just as long would have also caused the language to branch out and evolve in unique ways they could not even conceive yet.</p><p align="justify">Still, what little they knew gave them a base to work from and try to make heads or tails of these mutated pictograms. The pair sorely missed the reference material they had left aboard Requirement, however, but did not dwell too long on it. Who could have predicted that they would find ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs here of all places after all?</p><p align="justify">And yet, despite all of these hurdles, Angelina and Zacharias threw themselves into their work with a mad fervour. Beyond the obvious benefits they could gain from understanding what was written in this room, it provided a window into a part of history they knew almost nothing about.</p><p align="justify">For despite their long lives, the witch or wizard of Earth knew frighteningly little about Egypt and its history.</p><p align="justify">It was rumoured that the sorcerers of ancient times had ruled over the Muggles, building a prosperous empire and many grand monuments to their might. But before even the creation of the International Confederation of Wizards, the northern part of Africa had been sealed off from the rest of the magical world.</p><p align="justify">While muggle kingdoms flourished in the region, any living being with even the smallest spark of magic in them, be it plant, animal or human would wither away, leaving nothing but dust in a matter of minutes. Though many had speculated and theorised on the nature and origin of this curse, no definitive answer was ever found and that part of the world remained a mystery for the ages.</p><p align="justify">Through the centuries, explorers, researchers and renowned academics from the entire world tried to counter the curse and reclaim whatever remained of what was rumoured to be the pinnacle of magical civilization. Countless brilliant minds were lost in fruitless expeditions before the ICW came to be, officially declared the region to be off-limit and actively restricted any travel attempts.</p><p align="justify">Unbothered by the curse, the Muggles did not shy away from the desert and spent decades digging up all the priceless relics and ruins they could find, uncovering things that would have better been left buried. Cursed items and mommies were dug up and spread across the world, forcing the ICW to step in and cover things up to protect the Statute of Secrecy without any means to stop the source of these incidents.</p><p align="justify">It wasn't until a decade ago that the Goblins of Gringotts of all people discovered that the curse had disappeared as mysteriously as it had come. In an attempt to circumvent the ICW regulation and search for the famed vaults of the ancient kingdoms, they had dug tunnels under the Mediterranean Sand a calculation error saw them emerge in the desert.</p><p align="justify">Despite their best efforts to keep it to themselves, the news quickly spread and propelled the magical world into a new gold rush. Spearheaded by Gringotts, researchers, treasure hunters, tomb robbers and smugglers from across the globe came to Egypt in search of artefacts and buried riches that the Muggles had no way to discover.</p><p align="justify">To this day, the budding Egyptian magical community, supported by the ICW, has tried its best to regulate that mad scramble for treasure and knowledge. While they richly profited from all of this attention, they were also the first in line to uncover their past, what truly happened all those years ago and, most importantly, how to prevent it from happening again.</p><p align="justify">And now, a hundred light-years from Earth, a group of young witches and wizards were discovering that aliens had interfered in the ancient past of that region.</p><p align="justify">It wasn't hard for their minds to draw some hasty conclusions, yet a lot of work needed to be done before they could get some definite answers.</p><p align="justify">Unfortunately, without a concrete point of reference nor any similar material to draw from, none of the techniques they applied to the text bore any fruit and its meaning remained a mystery.</p><p align="justify">For hours, the four of them studied every inch of the room while Ginny sat on the edge of the ring's platform, and they could have continued for hours more.</p><p align="justify">After another failed attempt to activate the ring, however, it emitted two high-pitched sounds and the chevrons began to light up one by one.</p><p align="justify">"Guys?" Terry called out in alarm. "I'm not doing this."</p><p align="justify">The others turned from their work, looking at the ring in wonder as Ginny jumped to her feet.</p><p align="justify">"Pick up your gear, we're disappearing." She ordered, her helmet already back on her head, but they remained frozen in place. "Now!"</p><p align="justify">Rushing to comply, the researchers picked up the tools and data-slates they had scattered around and activated the invisibility modules of their suits. They disappeared from view just as the last chevron lit up and the guards stepped inside the chamber, spears raised.</p><p align="justify">Blue energy came out of the ring's inner track, converged in its centre and burst outward, vaporizing the offerings on its path before collapsing backwards into a rippling puddle that filled the inner part of the ring.</p><p align="justify">A small metal sphere came out of the puddle, rolled down the steps and stopped at the feet of the guards. Despite their confidence in their suits' cloaks, every one of them held their breath when an elongated beam came out of the sphere and washed over the room.</p><p align="justify">"Captain," Angelina whispered in the confines of her helmet after activating her communication stone. "Something's happening."</p><p align="justify">One of the guards picked up the sphere while the other looked around—no doubt searching for the invisible researchers—when a dozen armoured figures stepped out of the puddle.</p><p align="justify">Wielding long metal staves and dressed in chain mail and armoured plates, their heads were hidden behind large metal helmets shaped in the form of a cobra's head, their eyes made of glowing rubies.</p><p align="justify">The native guards took a step back in alarm, raising their spears as the puddle disappeared behind the newcomers.</p><p align="justify">"Jaffa." The man around which the other aliens were positioned called out. "Kree!"</p><p align="justify">The first of the serpent-headed men lowered their staves, their bulbous ends opening and blasts of energy burst forth, killing the guards where they stood.</p><hr /><p align="justify">In orbit, far from everything, Hermione sat in front of Requirement's main console, reviewing the data she had received from the shuttle before its untimely accident.</p><p align="justify">Around her, the bridge crew busied themselves by exchanging theories about what was happening on the planet below. It had been hours since the last check-in by the away team and their news of an ancient city straight out of the history books had fuelled many a conversation that kept distracting her from her work.</p><p align="justify">She was about to call it quit and leave when one of the consoles emitted a low-pitched sound, silencing everyone.</p><p align="justify">"That's new." Marietta said as she walked up to her console.</p><p align="justify">"Is something wrong?" Hermione put down her data-slate on the blueprint she had been examining.</p><p align="justify">"I don't know ... The ship detected an energy signature I've never seen before."</p><p align="justify">"From the planet?"</p><p align="justify">"No ... right next to us."</p><p align="justify">Out of the great vaulted window, they saw a blinding flash of light, like a crack in the fabric of reality as two ships—made out of a black superstructure surrounding a golden pyramid—exited hyperspace and settled into orbit.</p><p align="justify">"We have company."</p>

  <span>Ginny might not be an engineer, but she knew the specifications of her suit like the back of her hand.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>In its confines, neither external air nor smell could reach her. She was as protected from the world as she would ever be. She could keep it sealed, breathing fresh and scentless air for hours before she would need to refill her reserves.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>She knew that nothing could reach her.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And yet, despite all of that knowledge, she could still smell the burnt flesh of the dead Egyptian guards from the other side of the room, where she and the others were pressed against a wall, invisible.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>She held tight onto Angelina’s and Lee’s shoulders, stopping them when they tried to run to the guards’ aid.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>These men were already dead before they hit the ground.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Without a word, the aliens walked down the ring’s platform and across the room in formation, stepping over the bodies of their victims as if they weren’t there.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The two lines of soldiers passed before them, marching in perfect unison, giving them a good view of the cobra-shaped helmets they wore. The intimidating masks were so large they covered the wearer’s head entirely and needed to rest on their shoulders. Every part of them was detailed with golden engravings, making the large rubies that covered their eyes even more striking.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>As they marched, their leader abruptly stopped, standing still while his men left the room, and the echoes of their boots disappeared in the distance.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He stayed there, immobile for what seemed like an eternity.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The rhythmic thumping of her heart was all Ginny could hear, growing louder with each beat, filling her ears.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>She knew no one but her could hear it. That it was all in her head.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Yet the thought that the alien would somehow hear it still choked her with terror, coiling around her heart in an icy vice-like grip.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The serpent head turned, its ruby eyes flaring as the man aimed his staff weapon in their direction, its bulbous end opening with a crackle of energy.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Time slowed to a crawl.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He’s gonna shoot.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Someone was going to die.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>She could not let that happen.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Not again.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Ginny’s screams echoed in her mind, telling herself to move, to raise her wand, to stop him, to apparate away.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>To do something.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Anything.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Yet her body refused to move.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Her legs were rooted to the floor and her trembling arms were made of lead, heavier than the world itself.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>She needed to act.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>But the last time...</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Could she do this?</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Wouldn’t she just make things worse?</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>But if she did not move and he opened fire...</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Oblivious to Ginny’s distress, the eyes of the serpent-man flared once more ... And turned away, the weapon closing as the man disappeared into the corridor like his troops before him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Releasing her grip on her comrades, Ginny collapsed against the wall, her legs buckling under her as she took in some much-needed air.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>She could hear the others arguing next to her, their voice muffled and distant, but she could not bring herself to care about the meaning of their words.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It was happening again.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Everything was starting again.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Closing her eyes, she tried to shut off the voices.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It was all supposed to be over.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Why was it all happening again?</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It shouldn’t...</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It couldn’t...</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>A hand came to rest on her shoulder.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Dragging her back from the all too familiar dark corner of her mind.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Anchoring her.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You okay?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Opening her eyes, she met Terry’s, full of concern.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>She tried to speak. To give him some vague reassurance so he would leave her alone.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Yet no word passed her lips.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>How could he ask that?</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>How could he possibly understand?</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>But the longer she looked at him, the more she recognized that look.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Of course he understood.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>They all did.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Calming her breathing, the sensations of the world came back to her. She could feel her body again.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>She could be herself again.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I will be.” Taking the offered hand, she let Terry help her up. “Let’s get out of here.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>She could do this. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>She had to.</span>
</p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <span>“They’re taking position above the city!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m reading hundreds aboard each ship!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Someone get the Captain. We need the team back he—”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“They’re hailing us!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Chaos reigned on Requirement’s bridge, its crew running from console to console, shutting down an alarm as systems they had never seen before came online and crew members came running through the door.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Lost in the turmoil, Hermione watched as the new arrivals drifted closer to the planet, their black frames cutting imposing figures against the sandy world.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>This was exactly the type of situation that she had wanted to avoid. Sure, meeting aliens seemed fun on paper, but a first contact? Making an impression on an unknown and potentially hostile race that mastered space travel on their own? A situation where even the slightest mistake or misunderstanding could have disastrous and lasting consequences for their entire world?</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Christ, she was the last person that should be in charge of that. So of course the first advanced civilization they met would arrive when Harry and Justin were away.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Commander?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Marietta’s call brought Hermione out of her introspections and back to the bridge where a dozen anxious faces anxiously were looking up to her for guidance.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Time to step up.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Schooling her features, she walked up to the captain’s chair, hesitating only for a brief moment before sitting down.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>How many times had she daydreamed about being here—on the bridge of a spaceship, exploring the galaxy—when she was watching the telly as a child? She had imagined going on so many adventures, imitating the heroes of her favourite shows...</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>There was only one thing she could say.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“On screen.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>With her consent, Marietta turned the command stone on the communication console.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The face of a human man—or at least someone that looked like one—appeared on the holographic display above the main console, his forehead tattooed with a strange symbol of a snake circled twice.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Greetings. We are—”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Kree!” The man interrupted Hermione with a shout. “Bet’la shek’t, Asgard! In'trom Goa'uld cal mah. Chula a lazla kel shak?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Not the friendly type, then. And it didn’t look like English would do the trick.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Is there any way to translate what they’re saying?” Hermione turned to Marietta. “Or to tell them we’re peaceful?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t think...” Marietta restlessly read through the ship’s specifications, pulling up pages and pages of runes on her own screen as Michael rushed to help her. “There’s nothing on our end, but maybe they have—”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Kree, Asgard! Mol kek!” The man, shouted to someone of view before the communication was cut.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“They hung up.” Hermione slumped in the chair, more than a bit miffed that she had steeled herself for what could barely be called a conversation. “I can’t believe it. Who does that?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Rude aliens, apparently.” Cho huffed, just as scandalised.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“So ... What do we do?” Katie asked. “They didn’t seem happy to see us.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We need to call them back.” Michael called out as he turned from the console. "Whoever they are, they clearly know something about Earth and ship."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I mean, he did look human...”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“That’s one thing,” Michael continued. “but he also said Asgard, as in the realm of the Norse gods. I doubt it’s a coincidence that they have a word that sounds exactly like one of the big names in the same Earth culture that shared a writing system with Requirement’s builders.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Maybe they’re like us?” Cho proposed. “Some Norse people who got their hands on a visiting spaceship and—”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“They’re powering weapons!” Malcolm called out in alarm.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It took a second for his words to register and for the fear that had gripped Hermione’s throat to come back. Out of the great vaulted windows, she could already see the bright yellow bursts of energy flying right at them.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Raise the shields!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hermione’s order came too late, however, and the ship shook violently as the first volley impacted the hull.</span>
</p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <span>“...and every time Ra hides one of his eyes behind the moon, the rivers overflow and our fields are bathed in their waters. Thanks to this blessing, our harvests have forever stayed bountiful and our plates full. We thank him each day for it.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Kherun led the four men along one of the reed fields bordering the largest of the three rivers that brought life and trade to his city, emphasising his words with grand gestures that pained his old joints.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Dozens of farmers tended to the fields, harvesting the very reed that would build the boats they could see sailing down the rivers, carrying their goods to the other cities. They kept their heads low as they worked, sending furtive glances to their guests as they passed and he could not blame them.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>For fifteen moons, the people of Dakhla had prayed, offering gifts and sacrifices to the suns for their god’s safety as He continued His never-ending journey through the stars. They had patiently waited for His return, just as they had done for generations, preparing the offerings they would offer to His flying temple and hoping one of them would be chosen to serve at His side.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And yet, after only four moons, the priests had gathered at the Chapp’ai in the heart of the temple and disappeared, leaving them without their guidance for the first time since the dawn of their civilization.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>They had searched for weeks, combing the city and the desert for any trace of the holy men, yet neither they nor their animal-headed protectors were ever found.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>For nearly a year they had feared that they had brought the fury of the sun god on themselves, yet each moon passed as they ever had, bringing with them the nourishing tides and reassuring the people that there was still hope for their redemption.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And today, the time had finally come.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Chancing a look at the guests following him, Kherun was once again struck by how strange they appeared. Pale and young, the men were like none he had ever seen. One of them even had hair like the setting suns! The metal covering them from head to toe left no doubt as to their divine origins, however, even if the strange cut of their clothes and the lack of gemstones and ornaments seemed strange for messengers of Ra.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Fascinating.” The one called Justin marvelled at the sight of the rivers shining like jewels under the suns. “On Earth, it’s the rains that bring the Nile to overflow and bring nutrients to the soil of the riverbanks. You’re saying this happens every month?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Astronomy has always been used for farming, but this is on a whole new level.” The tallest of them—Serious, was it?—explained as he looked up to the suns, shielding his eyes. “An eclipse every month with the moon and both suns pulling from the same side ... I’m beginning to regret leaving my surfboard on Earth.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Their enthusiasm brought a smile to Kherun’s face as he continued his explanations, glowing with pride in his city and the approval of the gods.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Still, the fact that two of the guests had stepped away and were now whispering animatedly under the shadow of a tree kept the fear of their disapproval needling at his heart.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>If they had been sent to test their faith, they would not find it lacking. But if what they saw displeased them somehow...</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Kherun! Kherun!” Cries of panic stopped him mid-sentence as one of his acolytes ran up to them, his white robe stained with dust and sand. “Kherun, the gods!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What is it?” He stepped forward, grabbing the man’s shoulder to support him as he fell out of breath.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“The gods have come to punish us, Kherun! Apophis’ monsters came out of the temple. They’re taking people to the plaza by force!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Kherun’s blood ran cold.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Apophis, the serpent of darkness, Ra’s greatest enemy.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Doom had come for them.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Kherun, you need to come!” The acolyte shook his arm, pleading. “We have to stop them!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We can’t oppose the gods.” Kherun’s voice was faint, almost breaking. “But Ra’s envoys will—”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>When he turned around, Kherun saw nothing but a field of reeds and frightened farmers.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Like the last flickering flame of hope in his heart, the messengers of the gods had vanished.</span>
</p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <span>Forced by arms or threats, men, women and children flocked to the great plaza from every corner of the city. When they heard of the coming of the dark god’s warriors, some had entertained the idea of fleeing, of running for the dunes and hiding in the desert. These thoughts were short-lived, however, for the shadow of the great pyramid looming over them was just as constant a reminder of the gods’ power as the memories of the fire they could conjure to strike down those who displeased them.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And so, they gathered, clutching religious symbols tight as they spread the word on their way to the pyramid’s entrance where Apophis’ envoy stood, watching their approach through its serpent eyes.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He was not the only alien observing the procession, however, as four invisible figures kept watch from atop one of the largest buildings on the edge of the plaza.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t like this.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’d be shocked otherwise.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Harry did not look away from the gathering crowd to answer Justin’s complaint and instead took the heavily modified Omniculars that Sirius was holding out to him. Turning the knobs and dials, he tweaked the zoomed perspective of the device until it gave him a good view of the alien warrior’s appearance.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Nothing good can come out of this.” Justin insisted.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Oh, I don’t know. Someone down there might decide to turn this into a party.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You know what I mean.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“And you know damn well I don’t like it any more than you.” Harry spat, tearing himself away from his observations, Harry passed the Omniculars to Ron as he turned to face Justin. “But we can’t help them.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“These people welcomed us with open arms. They don’t deserve this!” Justin stood his ground. “Ginny said there were only a dozen of them. We could take them easily!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m with the kid on this one.” Sirius stepped in. “Aliens or not, they haven’t used any magic so far. If they’re just Muggles, it won’t even take a minute.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“And then what? They’ll still have two ships in orbit and we’ll be stuck here, waiting for them to bombard us. Requirement isn’t ready for a fight like this and I doubt these aliens will take kindly to our hosts if they learn that they welcomed us.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“So that’s it? We’re just gonna leave?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“It’s what’s best for everyone.” Harry’s tone was final, carrying with it the same impotent anger that brought Justin to stand up to him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>They could not risk the lives of everyone on his ship because of what might happen to Kherun’s people, no matter how welcoming they had been or how wrong it all was.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Justin kept glaring at him for a few moments before angrily walking toward the edge of the roof, Sirius stepping in behind him, looking at Harry strangely.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Nothing was going according to plan. The crash, the altercation with Zacharias, the trigger-happy aliens and now this...</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Way to show Sirius how great a captain you are, Harry. Why don’t you throw someone out an airlock next?</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Stopping a train of thought that would lead nowhere good, Harry gave a small sigh as he brought a hand to the communication stone embedded in his armour.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Ginny, are you there yet?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We’re getting there.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You may want to hurry up then. I doubt things will stay calm much longer here.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“It would go a lot faster if these dunes didn’t all look the same. We’ve lost the trail a couple times and had to apparate back to find it again.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You know,” Lee interjected through the stone. “I’m not even sure it can be fixed. The engines are pretty much scrap at this point.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We don’t need it to go all the way to Earth. I’ll settle for high enough for Requirement to pick us up.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“That’s already asking for a miracle.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Good thing you’re a wizard then. I’m sure you’ll find a way.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>With a tap on the stone, Harry cut the connection and joined the others on the roof’s edge as Ron beckoned him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Looking down at the sea of people filling the plaza to the brim, Harry knelt next to Ron as he pushed and turned far too many buttons and dials on the Omniculars. After puffing up some smoke and emitting a concerningly high-pitched whirr, a small trap opened on the side of the glasses, revealing a small speaker.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Hear me!” The deep and echoing voice of the alien leader came out of the device as if the man was standing next to them. ”Your god, Ra, is dead! I have come to claim this world in the name of your new master, Apophis!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Blasphemer!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Deceiver!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“The suns still shine in the sky! Ra’s journey continues and he will rise again!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Unrest and cries of protest spread through the fearful crowd like wildfire as mothers covered the ears of their children, muttering fearful prayers. Had the other aliens not been standing guard behind their leader, such words would have most likely ended in a riot.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Jaffa!” The leader roared as he turned to his guards.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Two of them lowered their staves and energy burst out of their ends. The projectiles flew above the masses and impacted one of the largest statues—depicting a man with the head of a bird—exploding it and raining down dust and stone on the panicked crowd.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Enough!” Easily recognizable from a distance, Kherun came up the ramp leading to the Pyramid, arms raised high. “I beg of you, do not hurt anyone else. Please.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The alien raised an arm and his guards stepped back, their staves once again aimed at the sky as the old man approached.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You speak for your people?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yes ... I am—”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“A slave. Nothing more.” The alien cut him off. “You will tell your people to comply and tear down the symbols of their dead gods.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“The night serpent will find no purchase here. Ra has protected us for thousands of years and his divine messengers—”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The alien struck Kherun with the armoured back of his hand, throwing him to the ground.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You dare defy the words of your lord?” At his feet, Kherun tried to prop himself up on his elbow, only for the alien to force him back down by stepping on him, his staff lowered toward the crowd as its bulbous end opened with a crackle of energy. “Do I need to make an example of—”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Alright, that’s enough.” Harry pressed a button on the Omniculars’ side, cutting the threat off as the speaker disappeared behind its trap once again. “We’re done here.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I take back what I said,” Ron said through clenched teeth as he put down the Omniculars. “I don't want to meet aliens anymore."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m beginning to think we’re cursed. It’s either that or the galaxy is just filled with arseholes.” Despite the levity of his words, Sirius's voice was hard as steel. “Feels like home.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’d rather they be the exception and not the rule. Now, pack it up. We have a flight to catch.”</span>
</p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <span>Abandoning the city and the locals to their fate, Harry led his team through the desert and back to the crashed shuttle that the others had dug out and set down on the sand.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Under the merciless glare of the twin suns, they found Lee and Terry on the wreck, surrounded by melted scraps and elbow-deep in the inner parts of the engines. Beneath them, Angelina and Zacharias were engrossed in a discussion, furiously looking up things on the former’s data-slate while Ginny put some order back in the shuttle’s compartments.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“How’s it going?” Harry stepped in next to Ginny under the meagre shade provided by the shuttle.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Not well.” With a flick of her wand, she reattached the lower part of a harness to its seat before looking up at him. “We repaired the breaches, but the engines are a lost cause.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I take it a mending charm won’t do the trick.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Not a chance.” Terry walked in, barely sparing them a glance as he removed a panel from the wall and started pulling out parts from the exposed components. “That thing is dead and gone. We’re working on alternatives.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Which are?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’ll let you know when we figure that out.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>With his arms full of not-so-spare parts, Terry walked back outside.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Well ... That’s encouraging.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Business as usual then.” Ginny tried a small smile, but her heart was not in it. “How bad was it?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Business as usual.” Harry sat heavily on a free seat, giving some rest to his tired legs. “Why can’t we catch a break for once?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We got away without any trouble.” Ginny sat down next to him. “We’ll be ready next time.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m more worried about Hermione and the others.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“They’ll be fine. They’ll stay out of range until we call them back.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“For how long? These guys don’t look like the patient or forgiving type. We don’t even know how much time we have before—”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Harry?” Sirius shouted from outside. “We’ve got company.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Repressing a swear, Harry ran out of the shuttle, the others hot on his heels. They climbed the dune up to its crest, joining Sirius as he looked into the horizon with the Omniculars. Lying down on their stomach, their heads barely sticking out, they peered into the distance to see a single file of people walking this way, too far to make out clearly.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Our new snake-headed friends are coming for a visit.” Sirius announced dryly, passing the Omniculars to Harry. “One of the white robes that was with Kherun is guiding them.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Not by choice.” Justin said vehemently.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“It doesn’t matter.” Harry shook his head. “They’re gonna find us either way.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Lee!” Ron called out and the engineers looked up from their work. “How long until this thing can fly?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t know ... an hour?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We don’t have an hour!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Shouting won’t help. This heap of scrap won’t be moving anytime soon.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Keep working.” Harry ordered as he pushed himself up. “We’ll buy you as much time as you need.”</span>
</p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <span>Leading the procession, the guide tripped as he reached the crest of yet another dune, his papyrus sandals ill-suited for such a march. Were it not for the bruising grip of the serpent-man behind him, he would have tumbled down the dune.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“How far are these false gods?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Not far, I swear.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Then walk.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The serpent-man pushed him with enough force to throw him to his knees. As he hurriedly got back to his feet to follow the tracks down the dune, rubbing his bruised arm, he heard a cry behind him and the serpent-man came tumbling down, the sand under his feet having turned to ice.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Kree!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Colourful lights came out flying from every direction as Apophis’ warriors retreated to the cover of the dune’s crest.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Running out of the line of fire, the guide narrowly avoided being hit by a bright red light that instead struck one of the serpent-man, making him flinch before he raised his staff and returned fire, sending part of the next dune flying high.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Holding no desire to risk witnessing a battle of gods, the man ran into the desert, leaving the chaos behind.</span>
</p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <span>“What the hell are these guys made of?” Sirius shouted as she apparated next to Harry, his previous hiding spot exploding in the distance. “It took three stunners to lay one down!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“It’s like fighting Trolls or a Dragon!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Go for indirect spells! They have a harder time shrugging off a boulder to the face.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The battle had been dragging on, each side refusing to let the other gain an inch, yet the aliens were slowly beating them back toward the shuttle despite half of their men lying dead under the suns.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>With the aliens staying behind cover and the wizards apparating away and turning invisible at will, the desert took the brunt of the spells and staff blasts, gouging out the dunes until they had no choice but to retreat behind the next.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The sand under the feet of a serpent-man swirled around and his lower half sunk at an alarming rate until he kicked himself free, taking out a good chunk of the slope.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>In response, the half-dozen aliens stood as one from behind their cover and deadly bursts of plasma rained down on Harry’s position, sending a dune’s worth of sand flying and leaving dozens of vitrified craters.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Jaffa! Kaltesh!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>With the wizards hiding behind their cover, the aliens pressed their advantage and split up, one side keeping up the barrage while the rest ran around the dune.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“They’re flanking us!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Damn it!” Harry risked one last spell above the crest—swearing when the warrior his disarming charm hit kept his staff in a firm grasp—before sliding down the dune “Retreat! Everyone, back to the shuttle!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Sliding down the dune and apparating from their hiding places, they rallied at the shuttle. Several of them sported a limp, their armours scorched and broken, armoured plates missing where the alien weapons had hit before they could disapparate.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m getting real sick of these Jaffa guys.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Time to leave then.” Harry stepped into the shuttle, finding Terry and Lee under the main console. “It’s now or never, guys.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I got it!” Terry shouted, sparks flying around him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The shuttle shook slightly as the engines purred and the console lit up, life laboriously coming back to the ship as Ginny rushed for the controls.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Everyone strap in! We’re—”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Sirius cried out in agony and collapsed in the compartment behind them, a fuming circle of charred flesh exposed on his back.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Ginny froze, her hands inches away from the controls while staff fire rained down on the hull.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Sirius!” Harry them himself on top of his godfather, conjuring a shield to cover Ron as he ran for the hatch controls.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Get us out of here!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Pulling herself together, Ginny grabbed the controls. The engines and hull groaned in protest when she sent the shuttle soaring into the sky, the rear hatch closing as they gained altitude.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Hermione, we’re coming in hot.” Harry tapped his communication stone as Angelina rushed to his side, murmuring an incantation as she passed her wand above the wound. “I need a medical team in the hangar now!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Who the hell were these guys?” Lee asked, strapping himself in.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“The messengers of the gods the locals thought we were.” Zacharias spoke through gritted teeth, grabbing on tight to his harness. “Those of a rival god, at least.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Gods or not, they got friends up there.” Terry reminded them as he watched Harry strap an unconscious Sirius in his harness “We’re not out of the woods yet.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Speaking of,” Ginny called out. “They’re here!.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What?” Harry joined her in the cockpit.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m picking up six flyers, closing fast.” Ginny veered sharply to the right and bursts of plasma similar to that of the staff weapons flew by the windshield. “Real fast.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Where the hell is Requirement?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m not seeing them on the—More incoming! Hang on!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Ginny’s warning came too late. Half a dozen crescent-shaped ships with wings curving downward arrived in front of them at high speed and the shuttle’s left wing was torn off by a well-placed shot.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Oh Merlin,” Someone in the passenger compartment shouted. “not again!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>With only one wing left, the shuttle lost altitude quickly and spiralled toward the ground. With the engines still running, Ginny managed to ease the descent until another shot took them out and sent them barreling into the ground.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>When they finally stopped, Harry tore his helmet off, fighting to keep his lunch in while blood trickled down his brow and onto the ruined console.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>For the second time that day, the shuttle was filled with pained cries and groans, and although the shuttle had stopped upright this time, no amount of magic and tinkering would make it fly again.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>After making sure everyone was still breathing, Harry tried the controls of the rear hatch, only for the door to remain stuck. A banishing charm quickly blew it off its hinges, blinding them for a few moments as light poured into the wreck.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Standing all around them, staves lowered and aimed, the aliens were waiting for them outside.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Their leader stood in the centre of the formation, his staff still pointing toward the sky as his helmet retracted backwards, revealing the hard face of a bald dark-skinned man, his brow marked with a golden symbol.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I am Teal’c, first Prime of Apophis. Surrender now, or die.”</span>
</p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <span>“They’re firing again!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I can see that. Just stay on course.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Alarms blared on Requirement’s bridge as dozens of bursts of plasma flew by the window, missing the ship by a hair’s breadth. Under them, the planet grew larger as their erratic flight pattern took them straight toward it.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“The shields can’t hold this for long!” Marietta warned, holding on to her console when another salvo hit the ship, violently rocking the ship.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“They will.” Sitting on the captain’s chair and flanked by the Weasley twins, Hermione kept her eyes on the three dimensional battle map displayed above the main console. “Put them behind us and redirect all weapon power to the rear shields.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Hey!” Katie shouted in protest as her console shut down mid-command.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We don’t have enough power to take out their shields while keeping ours. Not if we want to jump out of this system.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Commander!” Malcom called out above the alarms as the ship shook one more. “The shuttle just disappeared from the sensors! There are red dots everywhere!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>A cold feeling took hold of Hermione, stopping her heart for an instant before orders once again flew across the bridge.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Open a channel!” She could not keep the panic out of her voice, twisting it into a shrill. “Get me the away team!“</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The link was established, allowing sounds of battle and explosions to come out of Marietta’s console.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Get that door back up!” The voice was hoarse, but undeniably Harry’s. “We need cover!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Oh thank god.” Hermione whispered, sinking into the armchair. “Harry, what’s happening?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Hermione?” Even through the chaos around him, Harry’s surprise and relief could be heard clearly. “Alien ships shot us down. We need an evac now!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Hang on, we’re coming!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We can’t!” Marietta interjected. “We took too many hits. The shields won’t hold the re-entry!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We have ships incoming from the planets!” Cho called out. “Small fighters, by the looks of it.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Harry,” Hermione turned to the console. “we can’t get to you. Is there any way for you to join us mid-way?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Negative. We’re pinned down and the shuttle’s dead.” The feed went silent for a few seconds before Harry apple again, harder than steel. “Look. If you can’t come down, you need to get the hell out of here.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We’re not leaving you behind!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Everyone on board is going to die if you don’t!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Wait, don’t die on us yet, Harry.” George piped up.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“There’s still one thing we can try.” Fred followed up.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We haven’t tested it yet, but—”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No!” Hermione shrieked. “They could get scattered their molecules across the planet!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We don’t exactly have a lot of options here!” A large explosion echoed through the feed. “Whatever it is, do it now!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Biting her tongue to keep herself from swearing, Hermione shot to her feet, her hands a blur above the main console as she accessed a system she had expressly proscribed her entire team from accessing.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>When every parameter was locked in, her hand holding the command stone stopped above the console, a breath away from activating the program.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>If she did this, chances are she would be killing Ron, Harry and everyone in the away team. She’d have their blood on her hands.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What’s taking so long?” Harry screamed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shutting her eyes with force, Hermione put the command stone down and the bridge was bathed in light.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“-barda!” Ron’s voice shouted. Eyes still closed, Hermione ducked behind the console as something exploded behind her, sending people screaming. “What the hell?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Opening one eye, Hermione risked peeking from behind the console and found the entire away team, bruised and beaten but blissfully alive and not atomised.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Blimey, Ron! Watch where you point that thing!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“But I ...  We...” Ron and the others were looking around the bridge, not believing their eyes. Jumping over the console, Hermione ran up to him and tackled him into a hug, almost sending him to the floor. “What the hell happened?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You’re alive.” She breathed into his shoulder, overwhelmed by relief. “You’re all alive.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yes, we are. But we’re not done yet.” Harry turned toward their pilot. “Cho?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Aye aye, captain.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Avoiding the fire of the two alien ships, Requirement soared out of the planet’s orbit and right into hyperspace.</span>
</p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <span>Standing on a dune overlooking the remains of the strange shuttle, Teal’c watched as his men gathered the broken parts in preparation for their transport. These artefacts would be brought to their lord to be examined and studied for any trace of their origin.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>As First Prime to his god, it was his duty to make sure any civilization capable of building such vessels would be destroyed swiftly and utterly. The threat of their existence was not one that the Goa’uld would suffer.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And yet, locked deep in a part of his heart that should never see the light of day, something stirred. As feeling forgotten so long ago it was now alien to him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hope.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Looking up at the few stars visible in the darkening sky, Teal’c engraved a silent prayer for the safety of these strange aliens in his heart and that their paths would never cross again, lest he be forced to kill them.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He would arrange for any evidence left on the shuttle’s remains to be destroyed before they fell into the hands of the Goa’uld.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Anyone who would stand against the false gods and possess the power to do so was a gift this galaxy could not be allowed to lose. He would make sure they would be given the chance to fight. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He would have to be quick, however.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Already, one of the motherships was coming down in the distance, landing atop the pyramid of the capital.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Pushing this rare moment of honest sentimentality, Teal’c walked down the dune and toward the wreck. He did not have much time. Only a small part of Ra’s domain remained to be conquered, and his lord had expressed his desire to join the end of the crusade.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>One did not make Apophis wait.</span>
