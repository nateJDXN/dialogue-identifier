<br />
(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;A drowning man is not troubled by rain.&quot;<br />
- Proverb.<br />
<br />
:i:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
now.<br />
<br />
<br />
There were stories, of course. Shiro had grown up with them, just like every other avian child: A bird at sea is a bird lost forever. It was worse than being grounded; because once you touched the water, you never came back. They all had that fear trained into them, first with nursery rhymes, and then at the Garrison - what to do to keep your wings dry, to land on earth, on rock: better break your bones than drown.<br />
<br />
It was a well-founded fear. And even in his desperation, it makes Shiro falter - the rain and storm roaring above the ship, the water a black mess of crashing sound. He was frozen, bones locked tight, screaming in dread. The salt burned the cuts in his lip, the wind lashing at his skin. Behind him, someone shouted in the midst of a flare of fire; the ship rocks to the side with the hungry crest of the sea.<br />
<br />
It had been so long since he last flown. He couldn't fly. Not anymore. Shiro risked a glance back, hand on the rail of the ship. The ship rocks again, and his captors slip - stumbling. Then someone shoots at him - and the bullet clips the arch of his wing in a spray of blood.<br />
<br />
The water was slick on his skin, cold on his feathers.<br />
<br />
Shiro jumps.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
before.<br />
<br />
<br />
It wasn't as if they were forbidden to go to the surface.<br />
<br />
Technically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you stop nagging,&quot; said Lance, swimming around the long shadow of a rock towards the glow of the moon, &quot;There's no law against hanging around up top. It's not illegal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hunk swam just behind him. Lance wasn't sure how his friend was able to make such disapproving hand gestures while swimming so fast. Some innate, undiscovered talent, clearly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right, it's not illegal for merfolk to go up to the surface,&quot; said Hank, &quot;so you know. I'd be fine! But it is illegal for you to go to the surface without telling anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance made a rude sign over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, whatever,&quot; he said, &quot;I told you didn't I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't count!&quot; sand Hunk, exasperated. &quot;Your mom is going to kill me if she finds out. Again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Psshht,&quot; said Lance, &quot;Mom loves you. What can she do to you anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; said Hunk, &quot;She's the Queen so she can do whatever she wants, obviously!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Lance had stopped listening - he could hear the storm more clearly now, the soothing thrum of rain hitting the sea, the waves swooshing and buffeting them even at this depth. He had to sweep his tail constantly to stay near Hunk, even as they circled closer to the surface.<br />
<br />
Lance gave a few more hard swipes with his tail, propelling from the hips until he finally broke the surface with a splash. Lance gasped, taking air through his nose and mouth rather than his gills - the sudden absence of water making the air bite cold. It was so much brighter up here, even under a heavy storm. Hands steadying himself against the rock, Lance pulled himself up above the water level. There was something aglow in the near distance - a red yellow glow.<br />
<br />
Excitement ignited at the base of his spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a ship!&quot; he shouted, splashing Hunk who had just emerged beside his elbow. &quot;Look! Look - it's a big one. Haha, it's totally going to sink, what is it doing out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you so bloodthirsty,&quot; said Hunk peering at the ship and narrowly avoiding Lances' jabbing hand, &quot;Could just be sailors. Fishing. For fish. How long are we going to hang around because I'm hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance frowned at his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is not a fishing vessel,&quot; he said, &quot;It's military. Galran. I'd recognise that hull and the shape of that dumb canon anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know my eyesight isn't as good as yours,&quot; Hunk complained, &quot;Not up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ship seemed to be moving eastwards - or trying to. It was sailing perilously close to the rocks.<br />
<br />
&quot;C'mon, let's go take a closer look!&quot; said Lance, and dived off the rock and back into the water. He barely acknowledged Hunk's annoyed yell and propelled himself forwards, back deeper through the water where the rocks were further apart, squeezing himself through a short cut and scraping his fin on the barnacles clinging to the other side. He wanted to swim under the ship, maybe see a few sailors up close. Maybe prank them.<br />
<br />
The water flowed fast and thrilling through his gills as Lance swam; his heart thumping with excitement.<br />
<br />
He loved storms.<br />
<br />
Lance swam slower as he neared the ship, arching his back to look upwards at its small shadow on the water. It was being tossed in between the rise and fall of the water, like a small toy on the breath of a huge beast. Lance grinned with all his teeth at the thought - there was no love lost between Galrans and the merfolk.<br />
<br />
He swam closer - glancing behind him for a sign of Hunk. His friend didn't seem to be around, and Lance made an annoyed bubble with his mouth. Maybe Hunk had decided to go home without him. It was nearly supper time. Shrugging, Lance twisted his tail and swam further into the shadow of the ship, letting himself float upwards.<br />
<br />
He could see a huge steel anchor: the chains were thicker than Lances' arm, so there would be no casting them adrift today. He pulled at one of the metal gaps anyway, tugging hard. He jammed the hilt of his knife there - but it was too new. Lance patted the chain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Next time,&quot; he said, tucking the knife back on the woven loop that sat over his shoulder and hip, &quot;Next time.&quot;<br />
<br />
He followed the chain up to the bottom of the ship. It was huge - they always looked ginormous from this angle - and Lance pressed a curious hand to the thing. Most of the ships were still wooden, but the Galran had started plating the bottom with metal to stop Merfolk from tampering and sinking their vessels. This one had crudely beaten metal armour, thin but sturdy. The rivets stood out like knobs on a spine, and Lance followed them languidly as he swam, tail brushing against the ship. It was smooth against his scales; asides from crusted rust and various sea shells that had made their home there.<br />
<br />
Lance was chipping away at a gap in the plating, absently humming to himself, when something in his peripheral vision made him pause. He turned, head cocked. Something had fallen into the water with a big splash. It was a sizeable smudge, moving and churning up bubbles. It wasn't sinking all that fast, so it wasn't cargo, and -<br />
<br />
Lance's eyes widened.<br />
<br />
It was a person!<br />
<br />
Abandoning his task, he propelled himself away from the bottom of the ship and towards the struggling form. It was the wrong shape for a Galra, too short... but also the wrong size for a human. He whipped his tail back, pushing himself through the rough water. He tried to stay deep enough to be out of sight of the fire glow - he didn't want to be spotted, or get too close if...<br />
<br />
Lance froze, hand still clutching his blade. He was close enough to see why the figure cast such a strange shape in the water. It was neither human nor Galran.<br />
<br />
He had wings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no,&quot; Lance breathed, swimming closer. He fumbled his knife, trying to put it away, and within seconds was close enough to touch. Given the tales, Lance had half a mind to turn tail and swim off to safety. But something kept him there.<br />
<br />
The avian was still struggling, disoriented and sluggish. Its wings were half spread in the water, buffeted hard by the ocean. Lance could smell the sharp tang of blood, fresh and hot. It made his teeth come out, and he pulled in a few long draws of water through his gills to calm himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; he said, reaching out. The Avian twisted in the water, trying to look at him. It was making a lot of bubbles. &quot;Hey - can you - do you need help back onto the ship? Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
It had a pale face and dark hair. A broad chest and two legs, just like the humans. Its wings dark too, dwarfing them both with the span of it. A gush of bubbles escaped the Avian, his eyes were wide and panicky. They stared at eachother in the water for a moment, before the avian made an aborted movement, jerking away from Lance. All of a sudden, he went loose limbed.<br />
<br />
Belatedly, Lance recalled that Avians couldn't swim. Like, At all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit,&quot; he said, grabbing the figure underneath his armpits, &quot;Oh shit - no, please don't die. Please don't die.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was a lot heavier than Lance anticipated, but it was fine, Lance was a ace swimmer, the best. He propelled himself hard with strong strokes with his tail, hauling the avian close so he could hook both arms underneath his armpits, with the wings facing out. They were heavy and dragging and hard to manoeuvre, but Lance swam as hard as he could towards the surface of the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; he muttered to himself, There!<br />
<br />
With a heaving gasp, he pulled the Avian's head free of the waves, trying vainly to prop him up on his shoulder so that its head would be above the water. It was hard with the rain and the churning waves - Lance had to keep sweeping his tail in tight fast strokes to keep his torso out of the water. The Avian's wings were waterlogged, like limbs tied to the weed - and they kept going under the waves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Lance shouted into the Avian's ear. He would have slapped him except both his hands were occupied. &quot;Hey! Wake up! Do you need to go back to the ship?&quot;<br />
<br />
No answer. The Avian was limp in his arms, face slack against Lance's neck. He could feel the warmth of the skin - unnaturally warm - against his gills. He shivered, hoisting the body as high as he could. He got a mouthful of wet feathers for his trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Argh,&quot; he spluttered, &quot;Hunk? HUNK!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing. Goddamit.<br />
<br />
What was an avian doing aboard a Galran ship? Lance looked from the ship, then to the dark outline fo the cliffs. On one hand, the ship was this avian's best bet for survival. Lance had never met an Avian up close before, but he was pretty sure they didn't have gills, or nostrils on the side of their heads. Which mean that this one wasn't breathing properly.<br />
<br />
&quot;God you're heavy,&quot; he complained, hands slipping on the clothing. He hooked a wrist under the shoulder of a wing and tried to let the avian lie on top of him while he floated. A wave crashed over the both of them, and they went back down again. &quot;Shit, what do I do. Come on, wake up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
Lance gave the ship one more look - and then began towing his cargo towards the cliffs.<br />
<br />
Given the war, it wasn't likely that this Avian was having fun on that ship anyway. And plus, Lance would have to get real close to Galrans if this avian was to be returned up top - which meant risking his own tail. No thanks.<br />
<br />
Lance gritted his teeth.<br />
<br />
It was hard trying to swim half out of the water - his back was going to be sore tomorrow. His tail hit rock and Lance hissed, but kept going, trying his best to keep the Avian above water. Despite the sea, his skin was warm against Lance. He wondered if all Avians ran hot like this.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Lance was so preoccupied with his multitasking that he failed to notice an incoming shadow from above, until something sharp and metallic swiped him on his exposed shoulder.<br />
<br />
Lance gave a screech of pain, instinctively arching his hip to dive back deeper into the safety of the water - but before he could, he felt the whip of a rope, or thin spun metal - it stung and would have wrapped itself like a garotte around his throat had Lance not twisted himself in the water. As it was, the thing wrapped itself around his hurt arm and pulled taut, cutting into flesh.<br />
<br />
Lance shouted, barely keeping a hold on the Avian with his other arm. His back hit rock, and then suddenly there was someone above him, blocking out all the light from the moon. That someone was shouting, blade in one hand, garrotte in the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let him go you filthy fish!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance hissed with all his teeth, spitting and twisting with confusion and pain but mostly bloody fury.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell!&quot; he screamed at the newcomer, &quot;Get this off me! What are you doing? Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll drive this through your skull if you don't let him go!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was another avian; miraculously still air borne despite the lashing rain and wind. He was very close to the water, wings flapping in huge great strokes to keep himself aloft. The water reflected off some kind of shimmery armour. He looked like an avenging angel statue that all got their wings chopped off and destroyed during the war.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm trying save this dumb bird,&quot; Lance shouted, &quot;Hello! He can't swim and neither can you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not going to ask again,&quot; said the avian, pulling on the garrotte. Lance jerked forwards with the force of it, the pain making him hiss again. He wanted to throw a dagger at this man, but had no free hands. He felt like his shoulder was going to be pulled right out of its socket.<br />
<br />
At the back of his mind, he wondered if this was what fish felt like at the end of a hook - and shuddered at the metaphor.<br />
<br />
&quot;You let go or I'll drown the both of you,&quot; said Lance, patience and good humour leaking away. His arm was bleeding. The avian was bleeding. His tail was probably losing a few scales. Between the two of them, they were probably attracting all the sharks in the neighbourhood.<br />
<br />
The garrotte didn't loosen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're two seconds away from falling into the sea anyway,&quot; said Lance, &quot;And once in, you know you're not getting out. You lot can't swim for shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would a Mer try to save one of us?&quot; shouted the avian, who was turning out to be a real douchebag, &quot;Why should I trust you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good question!&quot; Lance shouted back, &quot;Maybe I should just let your friend become shark food!&quot;<br />
<br />
The avian was trying to grab onto his friend, but he couldn't get close enough without losing flight, and the downed avian was far too heavy to lift. The reality of this seemed to strike him with renewed desperation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you bring him to shore?&quot; he asked, chest heaving with exertion.<br />
<br />
Lance stared at him through the rain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cut this noose,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Lightening lit up the cliffs behind them, illuminating the water for a brief second.<br />
<br />
The avian threw his garrotte into the water. Lance was quick to pull it free from his arm, wincing. It hurt something awful where it had cut into his skin, but he took a deep breath through his mouth and hooked his arms around the unconscious avian again.<br />
<br />
There was a heartbeat at least. He could feel it, throat to throat. Poor thing had no gills; no wonder it was panicking.<br />
<br />
Cursing his own curiosity and cursing Hank's absence, Lance pulled them forwards into the waves, swimming half on his back to keep the Avian above the water as best he could. He knew, without looking, that the other avian was following.<br />
<br />
They sped through the storm, closer and closer to the cliffs.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Keith had not been the top of his flight class for nothing.<br />
<br />
But even he was having trouble flying in what felt like a bloody monsoon. His entire chest and back felt like it was on fire, his breath coming in strained gasps. His hands were going numb and he wasn't sure whether it was the exertion or the freezing rain.<br />
<br />
Only the sheer adrenaline of finding Shiro after all these long months was keeping Keith airborne. He had a wingspan and genes that favoured agile, acrobatic flight - not sustained long distances. And whilst the slim taper of his wings helped him with the strong wind that was buffeting them left right and backwards, he also had to work five times harder just to stay level.<br />
<br />
As it was, he could barely keep up with the merman who was slicing through the ocean like the shadow of a shark. Even with a fully downed avian in tow, that thing was fast. Keith reluctantly let some of his height drop as they neared the side of the cliff face; squinting through the rain. He could see Shiro's pale face in the water, still like a corpse.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stop it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The merman led them a little way around the curve of the coast, keeping to the fringe of the cliffs. And then, between one beat of his wing and the next they were gone.<br />
<br />
Keith cursed, tucking in one wing and dropping as close as he dared to the water.<br />
<br />
They were gone. There was nothing but water and dark rock.<br />
<br />
He should have never trusted a goddamn fish. Keith clutched his sword, feeling like his heart was about to thud right out of his ribs. He'd let it go. After finally finding Shiro, he'd let himself be tricked. Stupid, stupid, stupid! There was a noisy buzzing in his ears, screaming Shiro, Shiro, Shiro - <br />
<br />
He was interrupted by a big splash, followed by a piercing sort of whistle. The merman was back, tail arching at a slitted entrance through the rocks that Keith had missed. He was being waved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oi!,&quot; it called, &quot;You coming in or what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't breathe under water,&quot; Keith shouted back, eyeing the dark entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep to your right!&quot; said the Merman, who was still out of sight save for the shiny reflection of his tail fin, &quot;There's a ledge. Sort of. I don't think it's too deep. Hurry up, your friend is really heavy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Swearing under his breath, Keith sheathed his sword, swore some more and then took the leap of faith - he tucked his wings in and let himself drop the remaining few feet through the air.<br />
<br />
His boots took most of the impact, and Keith scraped his gloves on the rock trying to stay upright. For an awful moment, he slipped and the water just kept coming, past his knees, and Keith thought - fantastic, now you're both going to be fish food. But then he found his grip, and the water stopped; lapping forcefully around midriff. The bottom of his wings were getting completely soaked, but he couldn't do much about that now - he shuffled along the edge of the rock, ducking his head and tucking his wings as tight as possible to himself.<br />
<br />
After a few long moments of crawling and getting a faceful of seawater more than once, the space suddenly opened out. The sound of the ocean storm abruptly dimmed, to be replaced by the hollow echo of water lapping against rock, and the rasping sound of Keith's own breathing. It was almost pitch black, but judging by the echoes, the cavern felt very, very big.<br />
<br />
Ahead, just to his left, he could hear the sound of sluicing water and gentle splashing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay there, bird brain?&quot; came the merman's voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye - aghh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Later, Keith would deny that he shrieked at all, but the sight of a pair of blue eyes glowing at him out of the water almost sent him tumbling back into the sea.<br />
<br />
The eyes blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you crouched like that,&quot; said the merman. He was bobbing serenely - the water much stiller here without the waves - just shoulders above the water. His eyes had a strange, bioluminescent glow, which did not disappear when he blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's Shiro,&quot; Keith demanded, hand going for the hilt of his sword.<br />
<br />
The merman cocked his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a shee-roh?&quot; he asked, coming closer. Keith pressed his wings against the slimy rock. There wasn't really anywhere to go. &quot;...oh right, your friend? I put him down. You guys are really heavy, you know? How do you even get up into the air?&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith's eyes nearly bugged out of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put him down - we can't breathe under water!&quot;<br />
<br />
The merman splashed him with his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relaaax, I'm not stupid. I put him on dry rock. There's bits of the cave that doesn't get flooded, even in high tide, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I didn't know,&quot; snapped Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; said the Merman. &quot;Wait, hang on. I know what will help.&quot;<br />
<br />
And before Keith could say anything, the merman had dived back into the water in an arch of flesh and scales. His tail fin came up a breath later in a sweeping arc, splashing water all over Keith's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddamn!&quot; said Keith. Ten more Keith's echoed the curse back at him.<br />
<br />
From the depths of the cavern, a voice floated back on the water:<br />
<br />
&quot;You gotta stop falling for that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I fucking hate merfolk,&quot; muttered Keith.<br />
<br />
The merman didn't leave him waiting for long; a few moments later there was a little blob of light streaking towards Keith. As it came closer, it illuminated what appeared to be a huge lake, water gleaming smooth for as far as the eye could see (which wasn't very far: Avians didn't have good night vision). The merman was holding some kind of crystal lamp, which emitted a blue glow. Belmeran crystal lamp. He wondered how a merman got a hold of something like that, but pushed it to the back of his mind.<br />
<br />
The merman came right up to Keith, skin glistening with water. Held out the lamp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; he said, &quot;Be careful with this. It's not mine. Pidge would kill me if you broke it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith stared at the hands holding the lamp. They were remarkably human looking hands; smooth skin, perhaps longer than average fingernails. The same number of knuckles; same number of fingers. But he could also see translucent webbing between the digits, and the faint shimmer of fine, tessellated scales on the soft side of the wrists. Those were not human hands.<br />
<br />
Keith had never seen a merfolk this close up before. Usually no one lived to tell the tale.<br />
<br />
He took the lamp.<br />
<br />
The merman was staring at him, eyes big and curious. It had hair, just like Keith, and it wasn't green like the stories, nor did it look anything like seaweed. It was brown and a bit spikey with salt. Then the merman smiled and Keith fought the urge to recoil at the sight of a mouthful of sharp, sharp teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can walk around the whole edge,&quot; said the merman, seemingly oblivious to the effect of his grin, &quot;that bit is usually bigger in low tide, but. You should still be okay. Pidge has a dinghy but it's down the way, I usually tow him in 'cuase that's faster, but you look like you're gonna fall over any second. So just keep walking it's not far.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith eyed the rock warily, but straightened up properly. Transferring the lamp to his left hand, he kept his right on the rock face and inched forwards. His wings kept getting in the way, scraping the side of the rock-face.<br />
<br />
The merman was still staring at him, floating lazily on his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it hard to balance with those things? They're huge. And not waterproof, apparently. What happens when it rains? Do you all just, drop out of the sky? Seems a bit dumb. Hey, I've never seen an Avian up close before. This is cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith took another step; the metal shock-heel of his boots loud on the rock. The ledge was barely two hand-breadth's wide. The water shone, inky black.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Do you want me to hold your hand or something?&quot; asked the merman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you shut up!&quot; said Keith.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Keith splashed his way across a shallow divot, uncaring of the water as they came in sight of Shiro. He was sprawled on a wide rock bed, wings splayed out. Keith put the lamp down with a clang (&quot;Hey, be careful with that!&quot;), dropping to his knees beside his fellow avian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shiro,&quot; said Keith, patting at his face, his neck - checking his pulse. He was breathing, thank god, even though it sounded laboured and watery. Keith shook Shiro by the shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wake up. Come on, Shiro. It's Keith. I'm here. You're - &quot; he tried to pull Shiro up into his lap, off the cold stone - but only half managed. Shiros' head lolled back into the crook of Keith's elbow, and Keith felt like something was being pulled slowly, painfully out of his throat.<br />
<br />
He pressed his cheek to Shiro's cold one, trying to breathe normally. His eyes stung; with salt or tears... Keith squeezed them shut, wings coming up instinctively to cover them both. Distantly, he realised his hands were shaking.<br />
<br />
There was the soft gurgle of water as the merman pulled himself up on the rock; chin resting on his folded hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he going to be okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don't know,&quot; said Keith, quietly. He looked down at Shiro; at the new scars on his face; the bruise swelling his eye and the wound that was still bleeding his feathers red. &quot;Been looking for him for a long time. Thought he was dead. I can't - he's - &quot;<br />
<br />
Keith choked on the words, relief and disbelief making him feel sick and dizzy. The merman made a clicking-crooning noise at the back of his throat, a distinctly inhuman sound, but full of sympathy all the same. Keith finally looked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we - is there anything to make a fire? He needs to get dry and get warm.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the word 'fire', the merman seemed to recoil a little into the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I don't think so,&quot; he said, &quot;I might have some - dry stuff to help? I have lots of things in my collection!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...your collection?&quot; said Keith.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Turned out, the merman was some kind of hoarder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you get all this stuff?&quot; said Keith, looking at the piles and piles of assorted knick knacks. Even just within the puddle of light from the lamp, he could see cutlery, silver and bronze plates and bowls, glass baubles, jewellery, ten telescopes in a neat row, a few odd pairs of boots, two chipped mirrors and trunks barely closed with linen, books, drawing implements and - gold coins? There was also a leather bundle of what looked like a collection of knives and throwing blades. They shone free of rust, well looked after.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you steal all this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ships,&quot; said the merman, &quot;and it's not stealing if it's just floating around. Look in the brown chest, I think Pidge put all the fluffy stuff in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith set the lamp down on a nearby trunk and opened the nearest brown-wooden chest. Inside were stacks of woollen blankets, kept miraculously dry by a thick cushion of purple-green moss that smelt faintly floral. He grabbed as many as he could carry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have a name, or are you all Shiros,&quot; said the merman, splashing idly, &quot;I'm Lance, by the way. You didn't ask, which - rude - given I saved your feathery asses and all, but that's okay. I forgive you. I'm very forgiving. Because I'm awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Keith,&quot; said Keith from behind a mountain of blankets. He hooked the lamp onto one wrist and they made their way back to where Shiro was still lying unconscious.<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of name is Keef,&quot; said Lance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keith,&quot; said Keith, &quot;with a 'th'. And for that matter, what kind of name is 'Lance'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A name that you humans can pronounce,&quot; said Lance, &quot;My full name is too hard to say apparently.&quot; He made a complicated noise that was a combination of hissing clicks, ending in a shriek. Keith almost slipped over at the high-pitched noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;'Lance' is fine,&quot; he said hastily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hrmpph,&quot; said the merman.<br />
<br />
In the end, Keith found the driest place he could on the rock and made a nest out of the blankets to provide as much insulation between the cold rock and Shiro as possible. Then he dragged Shiro across to it, taking off his shoes and wrapping Shiro's feet in one of the blankets. Then Keith began the slow, arduous task of trying to drying Shiro's feathers. Keith could feel the salt crusting his own wings, and it made him itch where it had dampened the soft down feathers close to his skin. He wish he could build a fire. But Shiro came first.<br />
<br />
There was a loud slosh of water - and Keith turned just in time to see Lance pull himself out of the water in one, effortless heave. Suddenly, the merman was right there, peering curiously at Shiro, hair plastered to his forehead, scales gleaming. He was sitting on the rock. He was out of the water. Why was he out of the water? Keith was sitting in a giant sea cave with a merman who hadn't drowned them yet.<br />
<br />
Instinctively, Keith went for his sword again - but stopped when Lance gave him a very unimpressed look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?&quot; he said, lying down carelessly on his stomach and propping himself up on his elbows. &quot;Seriously birdy? If I wanted to kill you, I'd have done it already. You're two fluffy birds at sea. What are you gonna do. Fluff at me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get back - &quot; Keith tried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wait,&quot; said Lance, turning onto his side, &quot;You're too soggy to fluff right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
His tail stretched long and languid on the wet stones - it was longer than what Keith had imagined, tapering down and fanning out at the tail fin which was still swishing idly in the water. He didn't seem at all bothered by the cold, which made sense - but his bare skin looked like Keith's own skin. It melted into blue-silver scales somewhere around where the human waist would have been. The scales deepened in colour along the tail, and as he turned, Keith could see scales on the merman's abdomen, shimmery and pale and soft looking. Curiosity mixed with something hot burned at the pit of Keith's stomach.<br />
<br />
His throat felt very dry, and he swallowed, hard.<br />
<br />
It was probably all the salt water he had consumed in the last hour. Keith hated the sea.<br />
<br />
He turned back to Shiro, pushing out his let wing and pressing a blanket hard to it. Running his fingers through the feathers, Keith could see that someone had done a cruel job of hacking at the flight feathers. They were uneven where they had been shorn off, and there was clusters of feathers that were clumped by dry blood. They clipped his wings, thought Keith furiously, anger rising like bile, they clipped his wings.<br />
<br />
Pressing his fingers to one such hacked feather, Keith pulled it out with a practiced twist of the hand. The wing jerked in his grasp, but he pinned it down with one knee. Shiro did not wake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Lance grabbed his sleeve, &quot;What are you doing?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith wrenched his arm out of the merman's grasp, startled. They stared at eachother, wide eyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Helping,&quot; said Keith. Without looking down, he pulled out another broken feather from Shiro's wing. Lance visibly flinched, staring at the discarded feathers on the blanket and then back up at Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're hurting him,&quot; he said, accusingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you care?&quot; Keith shot back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I - you - !&quot; spluttered Lance, &quot;I saved him! I saved him first, he's mine now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith narrowed his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Know much about helping Avians recover, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance pouted at him, blue eyes glossy wet. Pouted. Keith reminded himself of the sharp, sharp fishy teeth behind those lips. He tugged Shiro more comfortably against him, so that the wing draped downwards across them both. Keith could hear his breathing better this way; it was reassuring.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll grow back faster if I pull them out,&quot; he explained after a long moment of silence, &quot;They - the Galrans cut our flight feathers like this so they don't grow back properly. You have to pull them right out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't fly without them?&quot; said Lance, patting the shape of Shiro's feet with unbridled fascination.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Keith. He resisted the urge to kick the merman right back into the water as Lance lifted Shiro's right foot and squinted at the toes, face pressed right up close.<br />
<br />
Keith could see the blue scales under Lance's jaw, covering the soft part of his throat. The light was too dim, but he thought he could see gills there too, parallel slits of silver.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long does it take to grow back?&quot; asked Lance.<br />
<br />
Keith sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you ever shut up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I just saved your lives! In return, you shredded my arm. You totally owe me some answers buddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith swallowed his guilt as he looked at the aforementioned arm - it wasn't shredded, but it was bloody; the garrotte having sunk into flesh; twisted and pulled. The skin was red and puffy, and he realised that the Lance had been actively keeping his weight off it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm... sorry,&quot; said Keith, carding his fingers through Shiro's feathers, &quot;I thought you were trying to drown him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance snorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;For what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith tensed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Merfolk drown sailors for fun,&quot; he said, &quot;everyone knows that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance rolled his eyes. It was an uncomfortable thing to watch, given that they basically glowed in the dark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; said Lance, &quot;Merfolk are all barbaric monsters who sink ships for shits and giggles, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith had offended him. He blamed the delirious exhaustion; and was suddenly keenly aware that, if he wanted to, Lance could drag both of them back into the water right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've never met one of your kind before,&quot; said Keith, defensively.<br />
<br />
Lance crossed his arms over his chest - and then winced as it reopened the wound on his hurt arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because people are crappy sailors doesn't mean that someone else is always to blame,&quot; muttered Lance, &quot;And plus. We don't drown people for fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
He leaned close, face inches from Keith's.<br />
<br />
&quot;We drown them for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance grinned, showing all of his teeth. They were inhumanely sharp, and there seemed to be way too many of them, and was his jaw unhinging - <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; said Keith, topping backwards into the wall. Shiro groaned as he was dropped unceremoniously back onto his blanket nest.<br />
<br />
Lance cackled, his laughter bouncing off the cavern and water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kidding!&quot; he said, &quot;but not kidding. I'll eat you if you pull your knife on me again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith glared at him, chest heaving with adrenaline. There was something in his hind brain that screamed danger! danger! at the sight of fangs and water and scales. He couldn't help it.<br />
<br />
Lance's grin faded a little at the expression of Keith's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I don't like eating chicken, okay?&quot; he said after a long pause, &quot;I'm not going to eat you. But it would be nice to get som</td>

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The words on Keith's right wrist say, hey kogane you alright.<br />
<br />
The words on his left read, stop why are you doing this to me stop it stop it stop<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Dad always makes Keith wear these plastic bracelets that wrap tight around his wrists. His first memory is of slipping bright blue bands on his skin.<br />
<br />
When he asks about the words, he's told about soulmates and soulmarks and being matched. But it still doesn't click for him, what the last words his soulmate says implies about him. He's a kid; he loses interest and goes back to digging for cool bugs.<br />
<br />
And then one day, he forgets to cover his marks.<br />
<br />
He's eight and awkward; he keeps his head down. He doesn't notice that people are talking about the words on his wrists until a kid sits down next to him at lunch and says:<br />
<br />
&quot;So I heard your soulmark's pretty freakin' awful, huh? What're you gonna do to them that has them beggin' like that before they die?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Keith asks. &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The other kid points his fork at Keith's bare wrist, and just like that, Keith feels naked. He turns his hand, presses the palm to the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your soulmate's last words,&quot; says the kid. &quot;They sound scared of you. You plannin' on stabbin' them or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
He laughs and it echoes, and that's when Keith realizes the cafeteria's dead silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't stab my soulmate,&quot; Keith says, but now that he finally thinking about the words, he can't see how they could mean anything else and that's--<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw c'mon,&quot; the kid snorts. &quot;Everyone in town knows about your ma and pa. She's gone and my ma says your pa carries around this huge knife. Rosie's auntie says he's got a temper, and just the other day, Stevie was lookin' for cool rocks and saw your pa yellin' and throwin' that thing at a bunch of trees.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kid leans in, grinning. &quot;We ain't dumb, Kogane. Your pa probably killed your ma, and judging from your words? You're gonna follow in his footsteps.&quot;<br />
<br />
He snickers. &quot;I mean, half the town already thinks so and if you ask me--&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith throws his lunch tray in the kid's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Food fight!&quot; someone hollers and the cafeteria explodes into chaos.<br />
<br />
Lunch trays go flying, kids are screaming, harried teachers rush around and Keith--<br />
<br />
--he leaves.<br />
<br />
He slips out of the room and heads for the main entrance. No one stops him when he walks out of the school gates, even though the lunch bell is going to ring in a minute.<br />
<br />
The kid was right; it seems like everyone has their eyes glued to the words on his left wrist, and yet they won't meet his eyes when he looks at them.<br />
<br />
It's a short walk home, and he spends the entire time glaring straight ahead. He keeps his wrists turned inward and close to his side, but no matter how hard he tries, he can't get the words what're you gonna do to them out of his ears.<br />
<br />
He wants to hit something.<br />
<br />
<br />
he's got a temper<br />
<br />
<br />
His house is empty when he steps through the front doors. Dad's still at work.<br />
<br />
Picture frames hang on the walls: Keith and his dad on a road trip, Keith and his dad fishing, Keith and his dad at an amusement park, Keith and his dad and--<br />
<br />
Never his mom.<br />
<br />
There aren't any pictures of his mom.<br />
<br />
He pauses, gaze flicking over the walls. He knows he must've had one, had to have one, before she disappeared.<br />
<br />
Why aren't there any pictures to remember her by?<br />
<br />
He tries to remember, has Dad ever mentioned her? Has he ever said her name?<br />
<br />
Keith stands there by the door and realizes, quite suddenly, that he has never seen Dad's soulmarks before.<br />
<br />
And a quiet, horrified thought slips into his head, like oil, sticky and insidious: that maybe the reason he doesn't have a mom is because dad's marks read why are you doing this to me, too, because he did something to her--<br />
<br />
<br />
your pa probably killed your ma<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
you're gonna follow in his footsteps<br />
<br />
<br />
He sinks to the floor, eyes wide and unseeing.<br />
<br />
And that dark, little voice continues to whisper: maybe his entire family is a bunch of soulmate killers, maybe they all killed each other.<br />
<br />
Maybe that's why he doesn't have uncles or aunts or cousins or grandparents.<br />
<br />
Maybe that's why he's so alone, in this small, dark house, in this tiny town.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When his dad comes home two hours later, Keith is still sitting on the floor, crying.<br />
<br />
He decides right then and there, that he's never going to meet his soulmate.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He keeps his wrists covered with more vigilance, after that, wrapped tight with thick leather straps his dad tore from an old belt. He wears it for years, in his sleep and under the sun. He gets horrible tan lines, but it's fine, because you can't see them unless he removes the leather. He doesn't really care. At least they're more secure than the plastic rubber ones.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, son, Dad said, when he helped wrap them the first time. His hands were big, enfolding Keith's entire forearm easily.<br />
<br />
He wasn't sure what his dad was apologizing for: Keith's soulmarks? Not knowing where his mom went? Never talking about her and letting Keith think she died by Dad's hands? Is he apologizing for the two of them, out here by themselves, among people who are wary of Keith? Who won't talk to him, who like to stare from the corners of their eyes, from across the streets with their friends, like he's different?<br />
<br />
Like he's dangerous?<br />
<br />
He didn't ask, then, but when Dad leaves him too, he figures that's as much of an answer as anything else.<br />
<br />
He ends up at the Garrison, where everyone greets each other with either their full name or something weird and outlandish, because they want to know. They want to hear the other speak and know for sure that this is who they'll spend the rest of their lives with, until they both reach the end written on each other's left wrists.<br />
<br />
But Keith does what he's always done.<br />
<br />
He stays silent.<br />
<br />
Because that way, his soulmate will never find him, and no one will look at him like that anymore.<br />
<br />
And it works. They're too confused and they falter when he simply nods, when he does nothing but look blankly at them as they wait for him to say whatever words line their soft skin, and eventually, they leave him alone.<br />
<br />
The only people he talks to are the instructors, with their rings shining on their fingers and their marks brazenly displayed.<br />
<br />
He's fine with that. He is.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When he meets Shiro, it's because Iverson arranges it. Something about him being mentored on how to form interpersonal relations with his classmates. Maybe refusing to communicate with others, besides occasionally barking orders in the simulator, wasn't as a good a plan as he thought it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, whatever is it you're trying to avoid,&quot; says Shiro, &quot;I think not talking is creating more trouble for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith just shrugs, because he's not about to spill his entire life history to a random junior officer in an hour.<br />
<br />
Shiro apparently takes this as a challenge and refuses to leave Keith alone after that. He's everywhere--in the canteen, wandering the halls when class lets out, in the sim rooms and the sparring halls.<br />
<br />
Keith's not sure what to make of it, because Shiro can be annoying with the way he doggedly tries to interact with Keith, but then he turns around and performs a barrel roll in the sim or executes a combat maneuver that lands Keith flat on his ass, and Keith is curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shiro hands him an energy drink after one of their spars. It's straight from the canteen with the modified Garrison ingredients, chock-full of nutrients and somehow still managing to taste like crap. &quot;And do your stretches, after.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith takes the drink, but sends Shiro a dry look. &quot;You know I can take care of myself, right? I've been doing it for years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well no wonder you're thin as a stick,&quot; says Shiro. &quot;Look, I'm not trying to mother you. Just need to get you to socialize.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If anything, you're making me want to move out and become a hermit even more,&quot; Keith mutters, and doesn't react fast enough to dodge the ear flick.<br />
<br />
Shiro settles down into a relaxed slouch at an arm's length away, gulping down his own drink and grimacing at the taste.<br />
<br />
The room is empty, save for them, everyone else having gone to eat dinner or retire for the night. Keith had hoped to have some time alone to go through his workout routine, but then Shiro found him. He's been doing it for three months now, somehow worming his way into Keith's solo practice.<br />
<br />
Keith tells himself it's not because he's a sucker for the cool moves Shiro pulls off so easily, the ones he said he'd teach Keith, when he stops being a 'loner.'<br />
<br />
&quot;I asked around,&quot; Shiro says suddenly, &quot;and it seems like eighty percent of your fellow cadets haven't heard you say a single word unless an instructor was asking you to answer a question in class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith grunts, already knowing where this is going.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've refused all invitations to the clubs I thought you'd be interested in--and don't tell me they didn't sound cool, because if there's anything I've learned about you, it's that you like sharp things and flying, which is what those two clubs were about; I know, I made sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith closes his mouth slowly, embarrassed. He avoids Shiro's knowing look and slurps noisily at his bottle.<br />
<br />
Shiro sighs, screws the lid shut on his own drink, and tosses it idly between his hands. &quot;I've tried everything, Keith, but you're being unusually resistant to even the least of social interactions. You already said it's not an anxiety thing, and I'm not going to ask you to spill all your secrets, but give me something to work with, kiddo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a kid,&quot; Keith retorts automatically. He scowls. &quot;I don't know why I have to do this anyways. Aren't I doing well in the areas where it matters?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, but you forget.&quot; Shiro points his bottle at Keith. &quot;The Garrison can't send you out unless your crew trusts you, and right now, your lone wolf act isn't helping that. People know you're good, Keith, they do. But they also know that you don't communicate, that you perform better solo.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to go out into the far reaches of space for entire months, you need to interact with your peers. If they can't trust you to communicate, they're not going to want you on their team, and commanders will hesitate to stick you in one. One instance of miscommunication out there could ruin you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith grips his bottle, the plastic creaking under the force of his hands. He stares down at his crossed legs, jaw clenched.<br />
<br />
On some level, he already knew all that, but he had hoped he could just avoid it until...well, until he couldn't anymore. Hoped the problem would just resolve itself in time, without him needing to explain anything. Just thinking about revealing exactly why he won't talk, why his eyes skitter away from hands and wrists and arms like they're something he can't bear to look at--it makes Keith sick to his stomach.<br />
<br />
He doesn't think he could handle it if people start whispering about him again, if they start leaving rooms when he walks in, if he ends up the center of attention, but for different reasons. At least here, they just think he's some weird robotic kid who only works, sleeps, and eats.<br />
<br />
But as he looks over at Shiro, with his earnest, concerned frown, a rising guilt overpowers the fear. Shiro's been nothing but bafflingly sincere in his attempts to push Keith into making friends, when he could've done the bare minimum to satisfy Iverson. He could've put Keith's problems aside to focus on his promotion to senior officer, which has got to be a hundred times more important to him, but he didn't. Not to mention the unofficial lessons and insightful advice for Keith's classes.<br />
<br />
He sets his bottle down, spins it on the scuffed floor. &quot;It's not like I don't know how to--to talk to people. I just don't want to make friends--&quot; and he hurries to add, when Shiro frowns-- &quot;and I don't want to talk about why, but I guess--I guess I could be...nicer? If it's that important.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shiro gives him a searching look, one that Keith meets stubbornly. And then he smiles, quick and relieved. &quot;That's all I'm asking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith smiles back, hesitant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; says Shiro, heaving himself up with a drawn-out exhale. &quot;Stretches. And then I'm going to sneak us over to the sim room to show you a feint I pulled off last week. Iverson says I'm not technically allowed to try it again until the board has reviewed it. Something about it being 'too dangerous' or whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith scrambles to his feet with wide eyes, practically throwing himself into his stretches, because no way is he going to miss out on this.<br />
<br />
Shiro hides a grin in the crook of his arm, but Keith sees it anyway.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He never says it, but Keith's grateful that Shiro doesn't attempt to pry the reasons out of him, once Keith proves that he's willing to stop frowning at everyone who walks up to him. Shiro just...trusts him to keep to his word.<br />
<br />
Which he does. Slowly, he lets himself have stilted conversations with the one or two cadets that sit next to him in class. And if it just so happens that he only interacts with the select few who've found their soulmate--well. He doesn't think anyone notices.<br />
<br />
Shiro pretends to wipe away tears with a finger when he hears about Keith's burgeoning social circle. He sniffles loudly. &quot;I'm so proud of you, Keith. So, so proud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up,&quot; replies Keith, and he swings his practice sword at Shiro's knees.<br />
<br />
So, Keith's thankful, but it's easy to go along with the teasing and lightheartedness, to hold back the sentiment that he's so relieved by the lack of questions, instead of saying it outright.<br />
<br />
The thing is, he can tell Shiro is curious--who wouldn't be?--but Shiro doesn't ask. He just. Acknowledges that Keith has his reasons, and tries to find ways to work around them.<br />
<br />
So, he's grateful.<br />
<br />
He should've told him.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Shiro's missing.<br />
<br />
Staring up at the broadcast from his corner of the canteen, Keith thinks, whose idea of a joke is this.<br />
<br />
But the newswoman on screen is grim-faced and the broadcast has the official stamp in the top corner and no one in the canteen is laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;--confirmed missing in action,&quot; says the woman. &quot;The cause of this accident has been officially labelled a result of pilot error.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pilot error?&quot; someone asks, incredulous. &quot;But Shirogane was the pilot. I've never seen him make a single mistake in my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
The speaker gets shushed, but there's a ripple of discontentment; people start to mutter.<br />
<br />
Keith can't look away from the screen.<br />
<br />
The newswoman shuffles her papers, eyebrows drawn low. &quot;The Galaxy Garrison was asked if it was possible to show the footage of the accident. They declined, stating it was classified.&quot; She looks up. &quot;What could be classified about a pilot making a mistake?&quot;<br />
<br />
The murmurings rise in volume. There's a roaring in Keith's ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;This doesn't seem right,&quot; someone whispers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn't we hear about this before?&quot; another voice says from across the room. &quot;MIA means the crew's been missing their check-ins for a while, but there's been no alarms raised and suddenly now we find out about this through the local news?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, Park, I can't hear--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she's right, why did the Garrison stay silent this whole time--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;--shit, I knew Holt, he had a little sister--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;--do you think they'll send a rescue crew?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A rescue crew--it takes months to get out there. By the time they reach Kerberos, they're will be nothing left to rescue--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;--look at this news article, some people are saying it's a coverup--&quot;<br />
<br />
The noise grows louder, chairs scraping back, people taking out their phones and standing up and gathering in circles, showing each other their screens and talking and whispering and arguing and--<br />
<br />
Keith thinks he might puke.<br />
<br />
Shiro said he would come back. He said.<br />
<br />
He had ruffled Keith's hair too hard, like he always does, and promised to bring back a piece of Kerberos as a souvenir.<br />
<br />
Keith had rolled his eyes and made a remark about contracting alien viruses and how Shiro should just stay out in space if he was going to set off a zombie apocalypse and Shiro had laughed and said, in that case, I've gotta come back for sure, then, if only to see which Hollywood movie got it right and then he left and he's not coming back--<br />
<br />
&quot;--ne, you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
The words sound distorted, like he's underwater. There's a hand on Keith's arm, in the crook of his elbow. He looks up and registers long lashes, blue eyes, a nice nose and then someone the next table over says--<br />
<br />
&quot;--think Shirogane has family? Someone's gonna have to arrange his funeral--&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith doesn't even remember leaving the canteen.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Iverson makes a crack about none of them being good enough as Shirogane and even that man ended up making a fatal mistake in the end in the middle of a sim review, and Keith gets expelled.<br />
<br />
For punching Iverson in the eye. And kneeing him in the crotch.<br />
<br />
But Keith knows he's right, knows it's not pilot error, so he finds himself wandering the desert, searching for answers, for Shiro, and for whatever it is that keeps whispering in his damn head, feeling pulled in too many directions and wondering if it all ties together somehow.<br />
<br />
He wonders for a long time.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There's a boy.<br />
<br />
Well, two boys and a girl. But Keith's focused on the pretty one, in particular. He's got a strong jawline, brown hair and smooth, tan skin and his first words to Keith are: &quot;Nope. No, you--no, no, no. No, you don't. I'm saving Shiro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith is still halfway processing his shock from finding Shiro here, looking like he'd been through hell and back, and aged fifty years in the process--a third of his hair is freaking white--so for the first time in a long, long while, Keith replies without thinking twice about soulmarks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; he says. And he didn't mean to sound rude, but the boy freezes for a split second and then his eyes narrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't remember?&quot; the boy asks, haltingly. &quot;It's me, we spoke when--&quot;<br />
<br />
He glances at Shiro's slumped head. Shakes his head, and tugs Shiro's other arm over his broad shoulders. Keith lets him; Shiro's gotten heavy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lance,&quot; says the boy. &quot;I was in your year at the Garrison, promoted to fighter class after you--left.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looks at Keith like he's waiting for something, eyebrows pulled low on his face. Something niggles at the back of Keith's mind and he thinks he might recognize this Lance, but it's hard because he purposefully purged all memory of the Garrison, cute boys or not.<br />
<br />
So, he just says, &quot;Oh. Okay. You guys wanna get out of here before they come back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance stares hard at him for a second longer, and then he looks away, eyes dark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lead the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When they get to his house, the others introduce themselves: Pidge and Hunk. Keith doesn't remember them either, but it seems like he's just as much of a stranger to them.<br />
<br />
And then Shiro reveals that his entire team was abducted by freaking aliens--aliens who want something called Voltron? Which is supposedly what Keith's been hearing in his head all this time and been searching for relentlessly and yet Hunk--some sort of engineer genius, he guesses--was able to find in under half a day.<br />
<br />
And then they fall through the ground and land at Voltron's feet. Sorry--paws. Because Voltron is a robot cat.<br />
<br />
That Lance apparently knows how to fly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, this is so cool!&quot; he crows and Keith barely has half a second to brace himself for the dizzying roll Lance puts them through, for the fifth time. &quot;She flies like a beauty, don't you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't know,&quot; Keith says through gritted teeth, &quot;since you're piloting her horribly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance doesn't even get offended, too caught up in his excitement. He throws his head back and laughs, neck on display. He whoops and hollers even as his hands direct the controls and push buttons with an instinctual skill that has Keith quietly stunned.<br />
<br />
He wasn't lying when he said Lance was piloting badly, in the sense that this is nothing like what they were taught to do in the sim; stomach-dropping flips and reckless nose-dives, but there's no doubt that Lance knows what he's doing.<br />
<br />
Yeah. Yeah, he can see why it was Lance who was promoted to Keith's spot when he left, out of the dozen hopefuls he remembers gunning for fighter class.<br />
<br />
And then Lance says, &quot;Guys, the aliens are here and I think the robot cat wants us to fight them,&quot; and Keith retracts his statement, because that was the dumbest thing he's heard, ever.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Keith thinks that's how their first meeting goes.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
keith is wrong<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
y'all ready to rumble?????<br />
<br />
upcoming: bear with me for the next chapter, as we have keith waxing poetic about lance--I mean, have some exposition. For the plot. Bc that is a thing that totally exists in this fic.<br />
<br />
<br />
(See the end of the chapter for notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem with Keith finding Lance attractive, is that he really freaking wishes he didn't.<br />
<br />
It's distracting, when he's trying to focus in a fight and Lance won't stop letting out a delighted yell every time he takes down a platoon or pulls off a cool move. He sounds alive and bright and Keith hates that he finds that endearing.<br />
<br />
It's distracting, the way he looks in his suit, lean and tall, and it only gets worse the more confident and comfortable he gets. He'll stand with his helmet between his elbow and his hip, leaning to one side with his head cocked, and Keith's eyes will track him like a homing beacon until he remembers to rip his gaze away.<br />
<br />
It's especially distracting, because Lance has a nice smile and nice eyes and nice skin and a nice goddamn scent--and that's just when he's fooling around. When he's serious...his eyes will narrow and they'll go sharp, ice-bright, and the ever-present mirth will fall from his face and leave only determination and focus behind.<br />
<br />
Keith is ashamed to admit that he walked into the castle wall the first time he saw that. And Lance wasn't even doing anything important; he was just struggling to figure out which plate of food-goo looked the least disgusting.<br />
<br />
So, it's small problem. Irritating, at it's worst, but ultimately, just that: a small inconvenience.<br />
<br />
They've all got soulmates. They're destined for other people, so Keith's not really entertaining ideas about him and Lance. In fact, he's not entertaining ideas with anyone, considering the ending promised for the person who winds up with him as their match. And Lance is exasperating on a good day; having him for a partner isn't something Keith thinks he'd be suited for.<br />
<br />
He just wishes it would stop, though. Having no control over his eyes jumping to the razor-edge of Lance's jaw when he turns his head--it gets tiring after the fifteenth time.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's because Lance is the first person he finds cute that he's forced to interact with daily--being stuck in space like this--because usually, Keith will notice prettiness, admire it distantly, and then just avoid the person until, eventually, the attraction went away.<br />
<br />
With Lance, it only gets stronger--gets worse, during the beginning months where Keith starts to realize that Lance is funny.<br />
<br />
And smart. And kind. And homesick and perpetually cheery and dependable and skilled with a gun, even when he's half-dead from a bomb.<br />
<br />
It's in that instance, that event, that attack from Sendak and the aftermath, that things get kind of--well.<br />
<br />
It makes it difficult. To just shallowly label Lance as cute and occasionally distracting and often annoying, now that he knows there's more to the guy. They took down one of Zarkon's trusted generals together and to Keith, it seems like there could be something else, here.<br />
<br />
Something like...<br />
<br />
Well. He kind of...would like. To be friends, maybe?<br />
<br />
Before that, he was fine with working together--coworkers in a war or colleagues--whatever. He was fine with them constantly butting heads--okay, maybe not fine, but resigned, at the least.<br />
<br />
But then Lance says we make a good team, and what the hell is Keith supposed to do with that?<br />
<br />
Because they do make a good team, and sue him, but he prefers it when they aren't at each other's throats, when they pull off badass moves together in their lions. When their exhilaration loops and cycles higher between them through that telepathic connection, until Keith is practically shuddering in his seat and grinning so hard his mouth threatens to split at the corners.<br />
<br />
So, he likes it when they get along. And with a taste of what they could accomplish, he wants to try. For the first time, Keith wants to figure out how the heck you make friends.<br />
<br />
Pidge is just as socially inept as him and despite that huge disagreement at the start, it's easy with her because they're both blunt and that doesn't offend either of them.<br />
<br />
Hunk is Hunk. He's friends with anything that breathes. He's the easiest of all to be around and Keith thanks a different cryptid every day that they have him on the team.<br />
<br />
Shiro...Keith wouldn't exactly call them friends. There's the leftover dynamic of cadet-officer, but it's kind of more personal now, without the stringent military thing. Most of the time, Shiro just nags about hygiene practices while Keith blatantly ignores him; he sticks his fingers in his ears and it's great because Shiro gets really red in the face.<br />
<br />
Once, the counsellor at the Garrison had laughed and said they acted a lot like brothers, but Keith thinks it's more like a ghost decided to haunt him and no amount of exorcism would remove it. Shiro pinched his ear when Keith told him that.<br />
<br />
So, the team is the closest thing he has to a social circle, but hell if he knows how it happened--or how to make it happen with Lance.<br />
<br />
Because Lance is the missing part to it all. He's the one person in the castle that can't stand to be around Keith for more than ten minutes, and Keith's not going to lie--it's disheartening.<br />
<br />
How can he build a friendship with someone who won't even be in the same room as him?<br />
<br />
So the months pass in that same routine: Keith tries to be friendly, and there's always a second where it seems to work, but then something doesn't click and soon enough, they're back to spitting fire at each other and Keith never gets an answer to what Lance's hobbies are.<br />
<br />
They go on missions and he gets little snippets--instances--where they team up and it's great and they have so much potential and Lance grins and Keith is right there with him, elation bubbling in his lungs--<br />
<br />
--and then they go back to the castle, and one of them will inevitably annoy the other and they'll stomp off in different directions. The livewire between them goes dead.<br />
<br />
It's frustrating.<br />
<br />
And Keith's just a little bit disappointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;friendship&quot; JUST SAY YOU'RE GAY KOGANE<br />
<br />
I tore out like a third of my hair trying to figure out what parts of canon this fic wanted to have incorporated--yes, this fic, not me, because I am not in control here. But like for the purpose of this fic, you can assume that shiro is still shiro, everyone is still in their lions, and the team knows about half-galra keith.<br />
<br />
WE GETTING JUICY NOW BABES<br />
<br />
<br />
(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you ever wash those,&quot; is what Lance says the moment Keith walks out of his room.<br />
<br />
He glances across the hallway and rolls his eyes.<br />
<br />
Lance stands there with his arms crossed, glaring at Keith's gloves. Of course it's his gloves.<br />
<br />
Last week it was his shoes and how they stink. The week before that had non-stop jibes at his pores, of all things, and interspersed with predictable mullet comments. The entirety of last month saw Lance grumbling about the stains on Keith's shirt, which Keith was one-hundred percent certain he was lying about because you can't see stains on black and Keith would know, he wore this exact shirt for two weeks without anyone noticing the mustard stain dead center.<br />
<br />
To be fair, that was when he was living out in the desert, but whatever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you just stand out here waiting for me every morning?&quot; Keith retorts. &quot;Because this is the fourth time this week I've had to see your face first, out of everyone on this ship.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not that I mind, he doesn't say. It's a nice face.<br />
<br />
Lance snorts and starts for the dining room, brushing past Keith. &quot;Right, because I would absolutely take the time to do something that dumb.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean,&quot; says Keith, &quot;there was that time where you tried to convince Hunk the food goo was haunted again but just ended up with your pants full of--&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance whips around and points a finger at Keith's nose. &quot;You. Shut up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith stares down at the finger. Looks back up. Raises an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
Lance narrows his eyes. &quot;I do not wait around your door just to ask you if your gloves are dirtier than they look.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, that's kind of what just happened,&quot; Keith says, and he digs his nails into his palms because it's getting difficult not to laugh at the rising flush on Lance's cheeks. Cute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha--well, I bet you don't wash them anyway!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you're right.&quot; Keith nods decisively. &quot;I've never washed them, and I never will. I like to have my hands forever caked in dirt and sweat and blood. It's great for the grip it gives me with my sword.&quot;<br />
<br />
He makes a fist, shakes it for emphasis, and starts walking again. He has to force himself not to react to the hilarious mix of angered and confused noises Lance makes as he catches up to Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you so concerned anyway? It's not like I touch anything you own with my dirty hands,&quot; Keith says.<br />
<br />
Lance gestures vaguely with a wide, sweeping hand. Keith ducks under it, sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're just! Always wearing it. It's suspicious. You gonna sue me for being curious?&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith glances over at him. Lance genuinely doesn't look anything else but inquisitive, in that irritated way he gets when he's stuck his teeth into something and is determined not to let go until he's satisfied. Keith gets flashbacks of him hunched over under a blanket, thumbs stabbing away at a game controller and staring dry-eyed at a screen proclaiming KILLBOT PHANTASM I.<br />
<br />
&quot;...It really is for better grip,&quot; he says, which is half the truth.<br />
<br />
It's less conspicuous than leather bands, is the other half.<br />
<br />
They're almost at the dining room doors and Keith stuffs his hands in the pockets of his jacket, noting how Lance's gaze flicks down to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's it?&quot; Lance asks doubtfully, &quot;You wear them to eat, too. Is that for better grip with your spoon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith feels a flare of irritation at the tone, but he swallows it down. It's too early to get into this with Lance again. &quot;My hands get cold, alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance snorts. &quot;Whatever. At least tell me you don't have them on when you sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith doesn't even hesitate. &quot;I wear them in the shower too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance chokes on his spit, and Keith smiles.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They're down on a recently-liberated planet, fresh from battle and eager to meet the native Feryter when it happens.<br />
<br />
There are smiles and cheers from the crowd when the team emerge from their lions, and Allura from her shuttle. They're gathered on the outskirts of the smoking city, in the open plains covered in glaringly orange grass. The juxtaposition of the blue-furred Feryter and the surrounding vegetation has Keith squinting against the assault on his eyes.<br />
<br />
Allura and the Feryter leader step forward to greet each other.<br />
<br />
Standing at Allura's back, with the rest of the team, Keith removes his helmet.<br />
<br />
This is where it goes wrong.<br />
<br />
The cheers cut off. A thousand snarls rise in place and the Feryter leader rises to her full height, fur bristling.<br />
<br />
Allura is immediately on the defensive, hands falling to her whip as she scans the Feryter with confusion and alarm. Keith and the rest of the paladins already have their bayards activated, scanning the skies for returning Galra, but the grey clouds above them remain purple-free. Keith exchanges looks with the rest of the team, but no one seems to know what's happening. His helmet is on the ground and he bends down to pick it up, eyes still fixed on the agitated crowd.<br />
<br />
The leader's head swings around with unerringly accuracy to focus on him. Keith freezes and sweat prickles at the nape of his neck as she throws her head back to let loose a loud, whistling scream that the entire group of Feryter echo.<br />
<br />
When she drops her chin, her eyes are slitted, black pupils on deep purple. Lips pulled back from her terrifyingly sharp teeth, she takes one thundering step towards Keith.<br />
<br />
And just like that, he knows.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well. He's surprised it took this long, to be honest.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's Galra,&quot; the alien spits.<br />
<br />
He expected it, but the raw hatred in those eyes--focused on him, the aggressive stance and bared teeth, it's more than enough to make him step back. His gut feels full of lead.<br />
<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Aziraphale, you don't need to wear the headphones. I'm monitoring the sound, right here on the computer.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: But I  like them. They make my ears feel all cozy, and protected. <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Suit yourself. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: And-- oh! Your voice sounds  lovely all up close like that--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [clears throat] Well. Anyway. <br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Welcome to the inaugural episode of The Ineffable Plan: an advice show for the post-apocalyptic era--<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: I just want to point out that this whole thing was  your  idea, Crowley. ... You know, so people are aware. Credit where credit is due, and all.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Of course it was  my  idea. Until last week  you  thought podcasting was a farming technique.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Not... an unreasonable assumption to make, given the etymological implications of--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [laughing]<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Anyway. I'm Aziraphale, and this is my... associate, Anthony J. Crowley. <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Thanks to recent events, we've found ourselves with quite a bit of spare time on our hands.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  We are very qualified to give advice on h--  people  problems.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Perhaps the most qualified of all time. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: We've really been around! <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Shall we get into it? <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Indeed! Righty-o, here... are the letters I've received, let's see...<br />
<br />
[the sound of paper rustling]<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: You had people send in  letters?  When you said you set up a mailbox I thought you meant  email-  <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Ahem. This shall do nicely to start us off. Question one. This is from Andrea in Hackney-- hello, my dear-- and she says: <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I live in a ground floor flat, and I work the night shift, so I get home really late. My upstairs neighbor has taken to playing EDM at extremely loud volumes early in the morning, I assume to accompany some kind of body-weight workout, because there's the sound of something heavy hitting the floor over and over as well. It's ruining my sleep schedule and making me unproductive at work. How do I end this torment?  <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  First of all, Andrea, are you sure you've not done anything to  deserve  said torment? <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Crowley! That isn't advice. <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [sighs] Fine, fine. This is an easy one. Here's what you do. When you get home from your shift, grab a knife, shimmy up the drainpipe, get the window open, and sneak into the upstairs flat. Cut the cables to the subwoofers, pitch the weights out the window, then climb back down and sleep soundly.  <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  I hardly think  any  of that will be necessary. All you need to do is climb a flight of stairs, knock on their door, and have a polite, face-to-face conversation regarding their disruptive activities.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  And  what  if they laugh in her face and say,  it's my apartment, I can do what I want?  Then what'll she do? It's not gonna be as simple as hello, goodbye, thank you! I know how these people are! No, this issue demands  direct action.  <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: I see what you're trying to do, Crowley, you wily serpent, but I refuse to endorse breaking and entering on a radiophonic programme meant for public consumption--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:   Podcast.  It's a podcast.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: -- have you considered that the neighbor might be going through some personal difficulties, and is trying to make a lifestyle change for their own benefit? <br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  Hey, Andrea, have you got speakers? You could play even  worse  music even  louder.   <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  Andrea, if you just wait a little while longer, surely they will just  give up on their self-improvement regimen, which is the end result of most similar resolutions-- <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Andrea, you could slide a threatening note under their door, one with the little magazine letters cut out--<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: ... Oh dear. Is every episode going to be like this? <br />

CROWLEY: Wouldn't you like to know. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: That settles it, then. I'm sure  nobody  else has to send in that question  ever again, now would they--?<br />

CROWLEY: Angel, I  will discorporate you.<br />

AZIRAPHALE: Didn't we see the original run on Broadway?<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Was the West End, yeah? <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Was it? No, it was New York! You wore that lovely red puffer jacket--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Oh god. That thing was horrid! <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Everything becomes horrid for you after 10 years of owning it, I don't see how that--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  Hold on. Hold  on.  What was the original question? That we were supposed to be talking about? <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: My my, I've forgotten. Something about ... furniture? Does it matter? <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: ... Nah. <br />

OK thanks to a million posts on my dash about it, I've finally given in and started listening to The Ineffable Plan podcast. And it's just as amazing as everyone's said, I'm dying laughing, but idk if there's something wrong with me because I honest to god am 10 episodes in and cannot figure out if the hosts are real guys or if they're just playing characters. There's like, a lot going on. Someone help me lmao.<br />

noooo lmfao asdlksdf i love when people think this. but they're real dudes. my dad actually worked with crowley at one point. the guy used to be some kind of london business cryptid, one of those independent consultants who'd come in and fuck everything up. iconic tbh. his old website is still up - anthonyjcrowley.com/consulting<br />

YUPPP chiming in to confirm they're actual regular degular people... i've been to aziraphale's bookstore in london, but that was before the podcast started when i was studying abroad there. i only realized he was THAT &quot;A.Z. Fell&quot; when crowley was teasing him in the last ep about his ridiculous shop hours and i was like OHHH lol that makes sense.  <br />

CROWLEY: OK, next question. <br />

[paper shuffling]<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: [humming as he reads] ...Oh! How delightful.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: What is it?<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  Crowley, we have our very first  complaint! <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: ... Give that here! [laughs] <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  Hey,  I  do the reading--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  Nonono,  please let me read this, it's too good--<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Very well. <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [still laughing] This one is from Harold in Cambridge, who says: <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I appreciate your commitment to the bit, as it were, but as a PhD candidate in Irish History at Cambridge I couldn't help but cringe continuously through your story in Episode 10 about the Battle of Clontarf. If you're going to be playing up this whole &quot;immortality&quot; joke, you really ought to be doing proper research. All contemporary scholarship suggests that Brian Boru was killed while at rest, praying in his tent. It would have taken a miracle at his age to get him up and fighting, as you describe-- <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  And maybe it  did!  <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [laughing]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;-- and additionally, Gormflaith goading the Vikings into attacking the Irish is a pseudohistorical myth, there is nothing to evidence she ever convinced her son Sigtrygg to go to war against Boru.  <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I dunno,  Harold,  she seemed pretty enthusiastic about the idea when I suggested it, but we were both fairly off our heads on mead at the time, so I suppose we'll never really know! <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: [laughing] Dear me. We better not breathe a word about Cahokia, if this is the sort of thing we're in for. <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Or the Queen of Sheba. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Or The King's Men. Would really be a shame to be set upon by Anti-Stratfordians.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Vicious buggers.  <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Utter twats. Unintelligent, shameful, elitist-<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Do keep going. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: ... I'd better not.<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  ...but if you  really want to wind him up, might I suggest taking the time to empty out all of the Splenda packets, replace their contents with garlic powder, and carefully glue them shut again before putting them back in his coffee tray. Never met a problem a good old Condiment Surprise couldn't solve.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  First of all,  don't do that, Andrew. Second of all, Crowley, garlic powder isn't a condiment, it's a seasoning.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: What? That's ridiculous. If it goes on food after it's done cooking, it's a condiment. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  You are sorely mistaken, my dear. It's a  spice, that's a completely separate category. <br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  No, it  isn't!  <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  Anyway, what would  you know about the finer details of culinary preparation?<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Excuse you, I spent a decade as a galley cook on a Spanish Galleon traversing the Atlantic, you'd be shocked to see what I can do with a hunk of salted pork. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  A  pirate  ship? Not exactly Cordon Bleu--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Says the man who's not prepared his own food since the Peloponnesian War. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  It's just  better  when  hu-   er. When  other people make it!<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Want to pout harder? I don't think our listeners can hear it through their speakers quite yet. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: [pouts audibly]<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  There you go.  Anyway,  garlic powder is, in fact, a  condiment, and one which you should--<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:   --should not-- <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: --replace your terrible boss's terrible Splenda with, and make sure you've got an unobstructed line of sight to him when he starts drinking it. Maybe try and get it on camera?<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: [sighs]<br />
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: I try not to make a habit of gratitude, but I must give our appreciation to everyone out there who's been listening and subscribing to The Ineffable Plan. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Ooh, yes, we've become quite popular, haven't we? <br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  Yeah, just hit number eight on the advice charts ... No advertising at all.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Mm. How ... miraculous.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: ...   Aziraphale.  You did  not. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  It's just-- you work so  hard  on putting it all together, my dear, I thought it would be a shame if it all ended up flying under the radar, so I just gave it a little push, as it were-- why  are you looking at me like that--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: ... Thank you. <br />

<br />
[INTRO SONG FADES OUT]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Listeners, you can't see it, but trust me when I say Crowley is sporting a  terrible  goatee. My dear boy, I rather thought you'd given up on that sort of thing!<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Change is in the air. I had to outdo that fetching ear piercing of yours somehow.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Oh, you noticed? I thought I'd--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [quickly] Don't flatter yourself. I've been meaning to do this for a while.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Well, I don't like it.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: And when have I ever cared what  you  liked? <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Oh, I don't know, since Rome? First time we dined together? And you only tried the oysters because I described in  great detail how much I enjoyed them--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Mm. <br />
<br />
[a pause]<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Dearest listeners, please feel free to chime in with  your personal opinions on Crowley's new facial hair, you can send your comments to the usual address--  <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: No, no, please, they don't even know what it  looks  like, how is that even fair--!<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: I'll be posting a photo on the, er, instant gram--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  I  know you don't know how to do that. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: [firmly] I will make it so that a photo has been posted- <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Let's just get on with the advice? <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Very well. <br />
<br />
[papers shuffling]<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Here we are... from Mina in Manchester. She asks: <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I work in a large office, where the dress code is fairly business formal. I'm one of the only women on my floor, and during the summer all the men are still in suits, so the aircon is cranked up to maximum. My teeth start chattering and I get such bad goosebumps I can hardly concentrate on my analysis. They won't let me have a blanket out at my desk, but they also won't budge on the temperature. What do I do?  <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Oh, how terrible. Central air's supposed to be one of ours! Look how it's being perverted!  <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Hey. Aren't we trying to stop doing that? Saying 'ours' like we're still--<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Right. I-- Old habits, you know. <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: 'Course. Yeah. I get it.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Anyway, Mina, you sound like a wonderfully competent young lady. Perhaps your skills would be better served at a company with better commitment to equitable gender balance, and a more respectful approach to temperature control-- <br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  Mina, I think  you  should start wearing a full suit to work. Bet you'd look  great.  <br />
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  Look, movie theaters are  meant  to be snuck into! I would know, I  invented the overpriced cinema ticket, to encourage that sort of thing!<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  I shudder to ask when the last time you actually  paid to see a film was, Crowley.  <br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  Hmm... Probably Pacific Rim-- oh, you wouldn't like it. Although there is a character who- look, nevermind. Besides, when was the last time  you  bought a ticket to  anything? Don't you just, you know, waltz right in there? Pull a Ritz and bump someone miraculously out of their seat, you shameless bastard? <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  For your information, I have  very  good standing relationships with box office managers and head waiters, I hardly  ever have to resort to miracles these days, that was a special occasion, I would never--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Hey. I was-- complimenting you. I like it when you ... you know. Get what you want.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: ...<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Anyway. Jeremy, I'm telling you that yes, you should consider it your moral duty to avoid paying for movies made by international entertainment conglomerates.  <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: But you'll feel bad about doing it, though. Think about that.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  Or... you might not! Think about  that! <br />

&nbsp;<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  Got a new segment today, guys.  Not  my idea-- Aziraphale wanted to spice up our usual advice routine with an... external contribution.<br />
<br />
ANATHEMA: Hi guys. Cute setup you've got here. Crowley, your place has such an amazing view!<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Does it? I hadn't noticed. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Let's give a warm welcome to Miss Anathema Device, who's going to be reading her lovely horoscopes on today's episode!<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Can we just get this over with.<br />
<br />
ANATHEMA: Alright. First up: Aries, your fly is down. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
ANATHEMA: ... and for all you Pisces out there, if you have any asparagus in your fridge, throw it away-- it went bad yesterday. <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [slow clap] Amazing. Bravo.<br />
<br />
ANATHEMA: Hey, Aziraphale-- what's your sign?<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Oh... Dear me, I've never really thought about that before. <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: You don't even have a birthday, angel.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Nonsense. I arrived on Earth just like anyone else, didn't I? Let's see, it was a few days after... I suppose it must've been... yes, let's say, the 24th of October. <br />
<br />
ANATHEMA: A Libra/Scorpio cusp? Wow, yeah, duh. Of  course. And you, Crowley?<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: No, no, no, I will  not  participate in this mockery, it's bad enough having you on  my  podcast to dispense your homeopathic nonsense, not how stars and planets work at  all --<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: ... But didn't you  invent astrology? <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Th-- that's not-- I helped  popularize it, angel, and that was just to make men on the internet mad -- <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Your birthday. Let's see. It must've been... June, wasn't it? I remember Eve was about seven months expecting when you popped up... <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [mutters inaudibly]<br />
<br />
ANATHEMA: Sorry?<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Speak up, my dear.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: 6th June. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: ... Ohhhh, of  course! How fitting! That means every hundred years you get--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Yes, yes, I  know.  What are the wretched chances. <br />
<br />
ANATHEMA: I think it's cute. <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: I regret everything.<br />
<br />
ANATHEMA: So you're a Gemini, got it, now I can do a compatibility reading for the two of you!<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  Uh-- ah-- there's  really no need--<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Dear girl, don't trouble yourself with such trifles-- <br />

ANATHEMA: [cackling] Too late!<br />

AZIRAPHALE: ...and it's all about  transparency, my dear, and being honest about how you feel--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [choking laughter]<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Are you quite alright, Crowley?<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: I'm sorry, I-- no, it's just funny. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Please, explain.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: You, talking about being honest about feelings, of all people--<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: I'm sure I don't know what you mean.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [scoffs]  &quot;We're not even friends&quot; -- ringing any bells? <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: I- I was under quite a lot of stress at the time, you couldn't possibly understand how I--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: You don't know what I can and can't understand--<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  We are  not  talking about--  that  . We are  talking  about  Emily from Glasgow's  difficulty with  her mother . <br />
<br />
[very pointed rustling of paper]<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Where was I. Anyway, yes, darling, you can't keep yourself in constant distress for the sake of propriety. Best to tell your mother how her habits have affected your state of mind. It might be ... hard to admit, and it might take ... some time, but the more you work at it, the more ready you'll be-- <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: You could also just stop speaking to her, forever. That might do the trick. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: No! Don't listen to him. Listen to me--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [laughs]<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: What- oh. Ha ha, indeed. <br />

AZIRAPHALE: Next question! This one is from... Jeff in Liverpool. Hello, Jeff. He says:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I got my account banned from Twitter because I was @-replying constantly to various politicians telling them to &quot;suck a dog dick.&quot; Was this fair? How do I best appeal to get my account back?  <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Oh dear.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  [laughing] I  like you, Jeff.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: If it was against the rules, then you should probably appeal by saying you won't do it again--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  Jeff, what I like  most  about you is that you made the words &quot;suck a dog dick&quot; come out of Aziraphale's mouth.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  --although I suppose perhaps you don't need to be telling the  truth when you say so--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [snaps fingers] I think you'll find your account has just been restored. Consider it a reward.<br />

CROWLEY:   Drones , Aziraphale. You're talking about drones. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Yes! Those are the ones. She could send one up-- <br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  No! That is  overkill!  It'd be spotted in a second! You still know  nothing about proper espionage, after all this time--<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  How would  you  suggest she see what's up there?<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Er. She could, ah. Get a really tall ladder? <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  And risk her  neck?  <br />

If you think about it, we literally sit here listening to these eps over and over, bc we're trash, whereas neither of them probably bother doing that. Like they're real adults w real jobs and this is just a fun little hobby for them yea? So here we are picking up on all this stuff that probably flies right past them in the moment as theyre recording. Hence our obsession with &quot;I loved your hair long&quot; from ep 18 which crowley didn't even seem to HEAR (!!!!) or &quot;angel, you ruin me&quot; from this week... like?????<br />

tinygaymouse<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean hes the one who posts the eps bc aziraphale is computer illiterate lmfao but if you listen you can tell that they're not edited at all, apart from adding in ad breaks sometimes and the theme song. Tbh he seems like the kind of adhd guy who doesnt have the attention span to sit down and edit an hourlong pod every week although that may be me projecting.<br />

Ok yeah i see what youre saying... is it crazy to hc that he just started the show so he could have another reason to sit and talk w aziraphale and the editing/posting is a total afterthought ??<br />

AZIRAPHALE: This one is from Brandon in York, hello. He says: <br />

&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;My favorite T-shirt went missing this week. The only other person who's been in my flat has been my on-again, off-again girlfriend who I'm currently not on great terms with. How should I ask her about this?   <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Well, she obviously took it. Probably to get back at you for something you said.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Now, that's not fair. You probably just misplaced it-- Crowley, must you assume the worst in everyone? <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: 'Course I do, I'm a demon. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: A rubbish excuse, you haven't been properly demonic in years--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [sputtering] Wh- h-- what, have you been keeping track of my evil levels? Trying to figure out if I could be redeemed? If I could be worthy? Is that what you've been waiting for, this whole time? Because if so, I've got some bad news for you--<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: That's not what I meant at all, you  know --<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  Then what  did you mean? <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Crowley, it was a  joke,  what the d-- what has gotten into you? Are you actively trying to pick a fight? On our  radio programme?  <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: I'll cut this bit out. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: No. Don't. <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: You want people to hear this?<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  I  want  people to know that- that you're just fine as you are. I mean.  More  than fine, you're-- Well. You're wonderful.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: ... <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  And if you've ever thought you  weren't  -- I-- I can only imagine that's been  my  fault--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [quickly] 'S not your fault.<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE:  But I didn't  help,  did I? Oh, you deserved better--<br />
<br />
CROWLEY:  Aziraphale,  no.  No, there's  no one  better-- I--<br />
<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: ... <br />

not to rain on anyone's tinhat parade after that last ep's insanity of &quot;you're wonderful&quot; and &quot;there's no one better&quot; but i feel like the initial argument implies they defs still have shit to work out before they like... get together. we know they've been friends foreveerrrrr so BOTH of them are probably just terrified of disturbing the status quo.<br />

<br />
mmhmm and it's like we can pick apart the storyline/&quot;narrative&quot; of the show all we want but even putting all the mythology stuff aside it's clear that as people they genuinely care about each other and know each other best of anyone. like obviously they haven't REALLY known each other since the garden of eden like they joked abt back in ep 16 but don't you think that could be like ... a metaphor? to symbolize a level of real life devotion that exists? or is that too galaxy brain of a take sdkfsdfs<br />

I just scrubbed through the whole thing looking for cuts and I'm pretty sure whatever it was came right at the end after Aziraphale left... otherwise someone would have caught it before it got taken down, if they started listening as soon as the ep went up.<br />

<br />
AZIRAPHALE: This one is from Kasey in Leeds. She says: <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;There are a bunch of adorable stray cats who live outside my house. They've started up howling together during the evenings and it's very musical. How do I monetize this cat orchestra and turn it into the next big viral sensation?  <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Oh, and there's... That looks like a web link, written out on the page. <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: An audio clip? Brilliant, I've got to hear these symphonic cats. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Here-- can you type it in, my dear? <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [snaps fingers] There. It's loading... <br />
<br />
[pause]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
CROWLEY'S VOICE [FROM RECORDING]: <br />
<br />
[sighs]<br />
<br />
Aziraphale... You are too much for me, angel. Too damned much.<br />
<br />
I thought it would be enough to just sit with you, without looking over our shoulders all the time-- I thought that was all I ever needed. Wasn't it? But it's not enough. I want more. I want  you.  <br />
<br />
I wish I could look at you and you'd just know, how much I love you. Without me having to speak. Maybe you do already, but-- [sighs] If I opened my mouth, I know it would come out twisted, wrong, burned, like everything I am, it would reach you a strangled and malformed thing, it wouldn't be good enough and the worst part is... I think... no, I know you'd want me to try anyway-- but I can't--<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Fuck. Monologuing again. Bad habit. Trying to quit. <br />
<br />
[silence]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: ... Um. <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: ...  <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: That wasn't meant to-- I never meant you to--<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: Did you mean it?<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: Did I mean--<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: That you love me.   <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: ... Would I lie to you?<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: No, I-- You never would. You never have. And you're right, you know. I did-- I  have  wanted you to try. Can you try, now? <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: But you already heard--<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: I want to hear it again.<br />
<br />
CROWLEY: ...<br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: If it'll help, I-- I do love you. Very much so. Crowley... <br />
<br />
CROWLEY: [swallows] Aziraphale. I love you.<br />
<br />
[pause]<br />
<br />
[the swift sound of soft movement] <br />
<br />
[the sound of skin against skin] <br />
<br />
AZIRAPHALE: [muffled] --It's still recording  -- <br />

CROWLEY: [directly into the mic] I'M KISSING HIM NOW, DEAR LISTENERS, FOR YOUR INFORMATION.<br />

            <td class="column21 style0 s">It's a dark and stormy night.<br />
<br />
Alright, it isn't stormy--just drizzling a tad. And it isn't even very dark, thanks to the motion sensing lights in the Manor's kitchen flickering to life as Jason slips in through the window above the sink. He could've just used the door--his biometrics are still programmed into the security system, which is the only reason his presence here doesn't set off Bruce's multitude of alarms--but there's a camera on the landing that snaps a picture of anyone who enters, and Jason would rather avoid any photographic evidence of his visit. <br />
<br />
Plausible deniability and all.<br />
<br />
See, he's just returned home from a mission with Roy that had gone a little longer than they'd intended. <br />
<br />
Like. Sixteen days longer.<br />
<br />
But in this line of work, that's just par for the course. Sometimes you show up, guns blazing, to bust a drug cartel, and you kick ass, and other times your buddy's exploding arrow malfunctions and you get captured and held underground in a bunker for two weeks until you manage to whittle yourself a shiv from a discarded plastic spork, shank a few guards, steal their clothes, and trick some lackey into letting you gain access to the drug lord's chambers so you can finish the job, all before driving off into the sunset in a stolen Jeep with a missing tail light.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;C'est la vie. <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, after a solid two weeks of forced team-bonding, Jason's little one-bedroom apartment had never sounded so sweet. A private shower, fresh clothes, a good night's sleep, and above all else,  a hot meal.  It's not like the cartel were starving them there, but suffice it to say that Jason doesn't want to see plain rice and beans again for at least a few months.<br />
<br />
Of course, the trouble with an impromptu sixteen-day kidnapping is arriving home at two in the morning--exhausted, sore, a little jumpy, and downright famished--to a fridge full of spoiled food. Because if there's one thing Jason Todd hates, it's going to bed hungry. <br />
<br />
It's a trauma thing--remnants of a childhood of chronic food insecurity, or whatever. Dinah explained it to him once. Practically speaking, it means his options are either breaking into the Manor, or hitting up the only 24-hour mini mart in Crime Alley for some laughably overpriced Top Ramen. And they don't even sell the picante shrimp flavor.<br />
<br />
So there's really no choice at all, is there?<br />
<br />
Jason pauses on the counter for a second to wipe his muddy boots off with paper towels--because  Alfred didn't raise an animal (excluding Bruce, of course)--before hopping down. Moving to the fridge, he rifles through the usual assortment of fresh produce and neatly stacked pyrex containers of leftovers, all labeled, dated, and organized in accordance with the butler's overly-anal storage system.<br />
<br />
He's perusing the offerings--02/16 meatloaf, 02/17 vegetarian lasagna-no onion, 02/17 roast turkey cutlets, 02/18 shepherd's pie--when suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he notices a slight movement from a brown paper bag on the bottom shelf of the fridge.<br />
<br />
Jason blinks, then rubs his eyes. The sleep deprivation these past few weeks must be catching up with him. But, no, the bag, marked simply with the timestamp of  7:30 pm, rustles ever so slightly again.<br />
<br />
Well that's not ominous at all.<br />
<br />
Carefully, Jason pulls out the package and unwraps it. Inside, he finds a pair of lobsters, their claws banded with rubber-bands, which only makes him more confused because after the absolute  fit Damian pitched last year, Alfred vowed only to ever purchase fresh lobster for-<br />
<br />
&quot;...the old man's birthday,&quot; Jason whispers aloud, suddenly recalling the date. A sly grin spreads across his face.<br />
<br />
Sure, he could just make himself a sandwich or reheat some of Alfie's meatloaf and call it a day, but he's had a  really bad past couple weeks,  okay, and nothing--honestly  nothing  --brings Jason as much pure unadulterated joy as being an  absolute menace  to Bruce Wayne.<br />
<br />
And if that happens to mean commandeering his adoptive father's one annual birthday indulgence for a post-midnight snack while he slumbers away upstairs? <br />
<br />
Well, that's just the icing on the lobster thermidor.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later, Jason has just finished dicing the onions and celery, one of Alfred's French cookbooks propped open on the counter to a dog-eared page while a mixture of water, wine, and spices simmers on the stovetop. He's about to start in on the carrots when he hears the quiet but still unmistakable creak of the fifth stair from the upstairs landing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Shit.  Jason flicks the motion light off and ducks down behind the island. Who would be up at this hour? The glowing numbers on the stove's clock show it's not even four a.m. This is supposed to be the sweet spot--when everyone's made it back from patrol and showered and collapsed into their respective beds, yet still several hours before even the earliest risers have emerged.<br />
<br />
Did he trip an alarm after all?<br />
<br />
Jason stills his breathing, listening as the sound of footsteps comes closer--which, honestly, is a little unexpected, given all the stealth training Bruce put them through. So that can only mean-<br />
<br />
There's a sharp thud of someone smacking straight into the doorframe, followed by a hiss of, &quot;Ow! Fuck...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jason stands back up, slapping on the light switch with a frown. &quot;Dickface?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;The fuck is he doing here? <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck are you doing here?&quot; Jason demands.<br />
<br />
Dick--left arm in a sling, right arm braced against his bandaged side, and sporting the beginnings of an impressive black eye--huffs out a short laugh. &quot;Could say the same to you, Jaybird,&quot; he says, wincing as he takes another step forward over the kitchen's threshold. He wrinkles up his nose at the steam wafting toward him from the pot. &quot;Are you... boiling  wine?&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;No,  you uncultured swine,&quot; Jason scoffs, turning back to the carrots to resume his chopping. &quot;That is a  simmer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick's gaze travels around the room, taking in the various ingredients before landing on the recipe's title in the open cookbook. He looks up again, blinking at his brother. &quot;Really, Jay?&quot; he says flatly. &quot;On his birthday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a rough couple weeks!&quot; Jason defends. Using the knife, he gestures vaguely at Dick's injuries. &quot;Now, why do you look like someone beat the snot out of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick shifts uncomfortably. &quot;Sting operation back in Blud',&quot; he says, moving gingerly over to the walk-in pantry. &quot;Didn't go entirely to plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason snorts. &quot;And you're always telling  me  not to go in with no back-up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I  tried  to get back-up,&quot; Dick huffs, opening a hidden panel inside the pantry to reveal Alfred's meticulously well-stocked medicine cabinet. He starts rifling through the painkiller section. &quot;Roy said he was game to help me take down these guys  months  ago, but suddenly it's time to strike and the guy's not answering his phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
The irony of that remark causes a sharp bark of laughter to escape Jason's lips. He knows  exactly why Roy wasn't picking up. The cartel had smashed their phones on day one.<br />
<br />
Dick glances up from the bottles, giving him a quizzical look. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Jason says quickly. From the sounds of things, Dick has no reason to suspect his brother's absence for the last half month was anything out of the ordinary and Jason firmly intends to keep it that way. Last thing he needs is a four a.m. post-kidnapping heart to heart with a doped-up Dick Grayson.<br />
<br />
Dick frowns at the orange prescription pill bottle in his hand. &quot;Is Percocet the same as hydrocodone?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason rolls his eyes because  honestly,  how do these idiots survive without him? &quot;We go over this every time. Percocet is  oxycodone.  Norco  is hydrocodone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's Vicodin then?&quot; he asks, holding up a different bottle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also hydrocodone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's not confusing at all...&quot; Dick mutters, shaking out two Vicodin into his open palm. He tosses them back dry. &quot;Ugh.&quot; He makes a face. &quot;Nasty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason's eyebrows raise. It's not like Dick--or any of them, really--to break out The Good Stuff willy-nilly. &quot;Just how hurt are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick gives a one-armed shrug. &quot;Eh, cracked a couple ribs. Bruised a kidney. Popped my shoulder out again...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason snorts. &quot;I'm surprised that shoulder's even still attached at this point. You dislocate it every other week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not  that often.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're kidding me, right,&quot; Jason scoffs. &quot;Are you forgetting the time you once sneezed it  out of place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hay fever sucks, what's your point?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And denial is a river in Africa...&quot; Jason mutters under his breath.<br />
<br />
Dick shoots him a tired glare, but Jason just flips him off and resumes his chopping. He makes quick work of the carrots and dumps them carefully into the simmering pot, then on a whim, he takes out a small frying pan and sets it on the stove with a little oil.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're just gonna stand there, grab the eggs, will ya?&quot; Jason orders, mincing one of the extra onions on the counter. &quot;And a green bell pepper, and the milk, and some shredded cheese. And ham, if you see any.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick opens the fridge dutifully. &quot;Having second thoughts about ruining B's birthday dinner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God no,&quot; Jason scoffs, side-stepping over to snag the requested ingredients as his brother deposits them onto the counter one by one. &quot;I'm just making  me  lobster thermidor, and  you  an omelette.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick looks up, brow furrowed. &quot;An omelette?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, because twenty bucks says you didn't eat dinner, and I'm not about to mop Alfie's floor when those pills kick in and you hurl from taking narcotics on an empty stomach,&quot; Jason retorts, chopping the top off the pepper. &quot;Now hand me a mixing bowl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick rolls his eyes, but gets one out of the cupboard anyway. &quot;I wouldn't have hurled.&quot; He hands Jason the metal bowl. &quot;Also I hate green pepper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, what was that?&quot; Jason mocks, still chopping away. &quot;Extra pepper you say?&quot; He dumps a generous handful into the bowl with the onion, receiving a very unamused look from his brother in return.<br />
<br />
Jason grins back. Messing with Dick isn't quite on par with messing with Bruce, but it's certainly up there.<br />
<br />
Dick closes the fridge again and goes back to leaning against it. He's quiet for a moment while Jason cracks the eggs and whisks them together with the veggies, then admits, &quot;B's been pushing me to get the surgery again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should do it,&quot; Jason says automatically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Dick balks in faux-surprise. &quot;Do my ears deceive me or is Jason Todd siding with Bruce Wayne on something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only because you're being a stubborn ass about it,&quot; Jason huffs, flicking an onion stem across the kitchen at him. &quot;Leslie's been telling you to get that shoulder fixed for  years.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's not  that  bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that good either,&quot; Jason points out. &quot;Why don't you just do it and get it over with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh...&quot; Dick makes a dismissive gesture.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's because the ortho told him it'd be a minimum three-to-six month recovery time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Jason and Dick startle when the new voice--hoarse and raspy--joins the mix. They turn to see Tim shuffling into the kitchen, a blanket wrapped around his shoulders. The dark circles under his eyes are reminiscent of a raccoon's and he's even paler than usual--which for Tim is saying something. He pauses on his way to the fridge to cough a few times into his elbow--deep, chesty hacks that make Jason wince in sympathy.<br />
<br />
That's bronchitis if he's ever heard it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do  you  know that?&quot; Dick demands, turning on the sick boy with equal parts annoyance and amusement in his tone. &quot;Did you hack my medical records again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's hardly 'hacking' when I wrote the encryption software for the database myself,&quot; Tim mutters. Reaching the fridge, he retrieves a metal water bottle and takes a sip, wincing as he swallows. &quot;Ow,&quot; he breathes out, then starts hacking into his elbow again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you even use the cough syrup I bought you?&quot; Dick asks as Jason flips the omelette over.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got me the menthol one,&quot; Tim croaks, wrinkling up his nose in disgust. &quot;It tastes-&quot; He cuts himself off, coughing a few more times. &quot;Tastes like ass. Said I wanted cherry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;CVS was out of cherry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could've gone to-&quot; Tim breaks into another coughing fit, this one going on long enough that Dick takes pity on him and limps over to help him cross the kitchen and collapse down onto the breakfast nook bench. Jason, meanwhile, starts the kettle going for tea.<br />
<br />
Tim's wheezing by the time the fit has subsided. &quot;Could've gone to Walgreens. God...&quot;  he groans, resting his elbows on the table and balling up his fists to press into his eyes. &quot;Can't wait till I'm eighteen and I can buy my own friggin' Robitussin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason snorts, sliding the omelette off the pan and onto a plate. &quot;Your problem is you're trying to buy it in  Bristol. Go to Crime Alley and I guarantee you, no one is carding minors for cough syrup.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, no one's carding them for handguns either,&quot; Dick mutters.<br />
<br />
Jason flips him off, scowling, and like the grown man he is, Dick sticks his tongue out in return.<br />
<br />
Tossing a fork onto the plate, Jason slides it across the counter at Dick--who for some reason has gone back to leaning against the fridge. &quot;Bon appetit, dumbass. Get the surgery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind your business,&quot; Dick grumbles. He pokes at the eggs a bit, looking unenthused.<br />
<br />
The tea kettle whistles, so Jason takes it off the heat and makes a mug of chamomile. He sets it down in front of Tim--who's coughing again so much that he can only nod his thanks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want some eggs?&quot; he offers, mostly because there's still half a diced onion on the counter and Jason hates being wasteful.<br />
<br />
Tim shakes his head, the coughs finally subsiding. &quot;'M allergic,&quot; he rasps out.<br />
<br />
Jason blinks at him. &quot;Since when?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Since ever?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason stares at him. &quot;But I've  seen  you eat eggs before. Like,  many times.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim flaps a hand dismissively. &quot;I'm not  deathly  allergic. I eat 'em whenever Alfie makes them not to be rude. I just usually throw up after.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Timmy!&quot; Dick whirls his head around in shock. &quot;What the hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not on purpose!&quot; Tim croaks. &quot;They just mess up my stomach, I dunno. And it's not  every  time, it's just that my throat already hurts so I don't wanna risk it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason blinks at him again. &quot;Okay there's self-sacrificial bullshit, and then there's  whatever the fresh hell that is.&quot;  He crosses over to the pantry and pulls out a canister of stone-ground cornmeal. &quot;Eat your eggs,&quot; he orders at Dick, seeing the still-untouched plate.<br />
<br />
Dick makes a face. &quot;These are like, forty percent green pepper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're good for you,&quot; Jason retorts. He fills a small pot with equal parts water and milk and sets it on the stove to boil with a few dashes of salt. &quot;Vitamin A and C and all that shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already take vitamins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think Flintstones chewables count.&quot; Jason measures out a cup full of cornmeal and sets it aside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then why are they the  pediatrician's number one choice?&quot;  Dick challenges.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do know you're twenty-eight, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a child at heart.&quot; He stabs a piece of pepper with the fork and brings it warily to his lips, then immediately shudders. &quot;Eugh. Yeah, no, still nasty.&quot; He pushes the plate away.<br />
<br />
Jason rolls his eyes. &quot;This is the last time I cook for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not like I asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You took  Vicodin, moron. You need to eat or you're gonna fucking hurl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not gonna hurl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you will,&quot; Tim says tiredly, head hunched over the steaming mug of tea. &quot;You've got the weakest stomach out of any of us.  And you're the whiniest when you're sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick scoffs. &quot;That's rich coming from Mr. 'I've Been Puking Eggs Twice a Month for the Past Four Years.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but I'm not a little bitch about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Tim and Dick continue to bicker, Jason cranks the heat up on the larger pot of simmering liquid, and the tiny bubbles begin to grow in size. Then he grabs a silicon spatula and starts stirring the cornmeal into the small pot of water and milk--which is now boiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you making?&quot; Tim asks curiously. <br />
<br />
Jason points at the first pot. &quot;Lobster thermidor-&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim covers his face with his hands.  &quot;You're such an ass, Jay,&quot; he mutters into them.<br />
<br />
&quot;-and for  you,  I'm making grits,&quot; he finishes, nodding to the pot of corn mush he's stirring. &quot;You're fucking welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grits?&quot; Tim looks up again, wrinkling his nose. &quot;That's like, baby food.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,  excuse me?&quot;  Jason balks at him. &quot;I think you mean a  fucking delicious southern staple.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not even hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason points his spatula at him threateningly. &quot;Do I look like I care?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim opens his mouth to retort something, but due to another coughing jag, Jason doesn't find out what. It's probably for the best.<br />
<br />
As Tim's getting his breath back, Jason unwraps the lobsters and drops them into the boiling stock. He covers the pot, then checks the cookbook and turns to Dick. &quot;I need the mushrooms, a lemon, and some butter,&quot; he orders, pointing to the fridge.<br />
<br />
Dick sighs and pushes himself away from the fridge door again while Jason gives the grits another few stirs. It's thickening up nicely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; Dick says, handing over the items. Then he closes the door again and goes back to leaning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why aren't you sitting down?&quot; Jason asks. He gestures over at the breakfast nook. &quot;I know Tiny Tim's got the plague over there, but I would've thought your ironclad Flintstones immune system could take it.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that, Tim barks out a laugh so suddenly that it triggers another round of coughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jason gives him a quizzical look. &quot;It wasn't  that  funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
If he didn't know any better, he'd swear he sees Dick's face flush. &quot;He's delirious,&quot; the older boy mumbles. &quot;Fever, you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Not,&quot;  a new voice says sharply, and all three boys jump--Jason so badly that he jerks the spatula and accidentally flings some grits across the stove.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ, Cass,&quot; he breathes out, still clutching his chest. &quot;How long have you been here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassandra emerges from the shadows on the far end of the kitchen, grinning. &quot;Long time. Heard you come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'S that why you're up?&quot; Tim rasps out. &quot;We bein' too loud?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shakes her head. &quot;Up before, too. Not a sleeping night.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all nod in understanding. Ever since Cass first joined the family, they've been aware of her little idiosyncrasies, including her proclivity to silently patrol the Manor some nights instead of sleeping. Dinah says it's anxiety that causes Cass to not always feel safe in her own room, and Cass just shrugs at that.<br />
<br />
Cass's eyes sparkle mischievously. She points a finger at Dick. &quot;Can't sit. Because...&quot; She points at her own rear end, then mimes a kicking motion, which causes Tim to bark out another cough-laugh and Dick to groan and slide a hand over his face in exasperation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Cass...&quot;  he whines.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, wait...&quot; Jason feels the corners of his mouth spreading into a shit-eating grin. &quot;Dickhead... is she saying you  literally got your ass kicked?&quot; <br />
<br />
More cough-laughs from Tim, and a louder groan from Dick.<br />
<br />
Cass nods, grinning. &quot;Boot,&quot; she adds. &quot;Steel toe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason is doubled over laughing now.  &quot;Oh my god,  Dick. You got your fucking  ass kicked!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick shoots him a glare. &quot;It's called a fractured tailbone,  Jason,&quot;  he says through gritted teeth. &quot;And I'll have you know, I was winning that fight until the shoulder went out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;See?!&quot;  both Jason and Tim exclaim in unison, but Dick only scowls.<br />
<br />
Once Jason's managed to wipe the tears from his eyes, the grits are bubbling. He turns off the heat and dishes up a bowlful, shoulders still shaking with silent giggles. After adding a pat of butter to the top and some more salt, he sets it down in front of Tim, along with a spoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Tim mumbles, and to Jason's surprise, he actually picks up the spoon and starts eating. <br />
<br />
(Then again, given his history with the eggs, that doesn't mean much from him.)<br />
<br />
Jason turns to Cass. &quot;And what would  you like from the short order cook tonight?&quot; he sighs.<br />
<br />
Her face twists up in thought. &quot;Meat,&quot; she answers after a second's deliberation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meat?&quot; Jason echoes. &quot;Any particular kind?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shrugs. &quot;Any. Not picky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you don't want grits?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her face scrunches up. &quot;Not a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does everyone keep calling it baby food?&quot; Jason demands hotly. He rips the plastic off the top of the mushroom container and starts rinsing the dirt off them in the sink. &quot;Grits are a fucking  delicacy.  If I called it  polenta would you eat it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cass shakes her head. &quot;I have teeth,&quot; she says simply. &quot;Want meat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you do...&quot; Jason mutters under his breath, but it only makes her grin again. &quot;O Great Guardian of the Fridge,&quot; he addresses Dick with a mocking little bow. &quot;Bacon, if you would be so kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick tosses him a tired salute and gets it out. He's looking progressively more dead on his feet, so Jason knows the drugs must be finally kicking in now.<br />
<br />
Jason turns back to Cass with a sigh. &quot;Do you know what a donut pillow is?&quot; he asks.<br />
<br />
She nods, swooping her hands around in a circle to outline its shape. &quot;For sitting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot; Jason returns the nod. &quot;The old man keeps one upstairs in his bedroom closet for bad back days. Think you can sneak in and grab it without waking him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy,&quot; she says confidently, and Jason snorts. Bruce is a notoriously light sleeper, but he supposes if anyone has a hope of getting in and out undetected, it's the resident trained ninja assassin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't need the donut, Cass,&quot; Dick grumbles as Jason takes two pans--one larger frying one, and a smaller saute pan--and sets them both on the stove.<br />
<br />
Cass shakes her head back and forth a few times. &quot;Dumb brother...&quot; she sighs fondly, and then slips out of the room without a single sound. <br />
<br />
While she's gone, Jason starts the mushrooms stewing with butter and lemon juice in the saute pan. Then to the larger pan, he adds bacon strips, dropping them in carefully with tongs to avoid getting splashed with grease when they sizzle.<br />
<br />
Cass returns a few minutes later, donut pillow tucked under her arm. She skips back through the kitchen and deposits it on the bench opposite Tim at the breakfast nook. &quot;Sit,&quot; she says sweetly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm...&quot; Dick hums a bit, causing Jason to glance up from the stove. His brother has his eyes closed and is leaning the back of his head against the fridge door, breathing shallowly through his half-open mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well? Go sit down before you fall asleep standing up,&quot; Jason orders, pointing across the room at the bench. &quot;You've broken enough bones for one day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm-hmm,&quot; Dick hums again, and slowly pushes himself away from the support of the fridge. He shuffles slowly over to the bench and sits down on the pillow with a sigh, immediately resting his forehead down on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't bring your omelette,&quot; Tim points out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't want it,&quot; Dick mumbles into the table top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I didn't make it for show,&quot; Jason scoffs. &quot;Cass&quot;--he nods toward the barely touched plate on the counter--&quot;can you bring him his omelette?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noo...&quot; Dick groans, just bordering on a whine. &quot;I can't eat that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh grow up, Richard, it's a fucking pepper,&quot; Jason grumbles while Cass sets the plate down in front of him.<br />
<br />
Dick gulps audibly, the smallest of moans escaping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dick...?&quot; Tim asks warily, pulling the plate back away from him. &quot;Are you gonna-&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Trying not to,&quot;  he grits out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh for fuck's sake!&quot; Jason exclaims in exasperation, abandoning the bacon to move to the pantry. &quot;What did we  fucking tell you?  Cass, get a-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bowl,&quot; she agrees readily, racing over to the appropriate cabinet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim!&quot; Jason grabs a sleeve of saltines from a box in the pantry and lobs it across the kitchen. Tim--who isn't even looking up--shoots out a hand to catch it on reflex. <br />
<br />
Cass plops an empty mixing bowl down in front of Dick. He immediately sits up and pulls it over to him, breathing heavily. Tim rips the crackers open and shoves one into Dick's hand, bending his fingers around it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Eat,&quot; Tim orders, and this time Dick obliges, bringing the saltine up to his mouth with a grimace and starting to nibble at it while Jason grabs a can of ginger ale from the fridge and plunks it down in front of him.<br />
<br />
After a few tense minutes, it seems as though the danger has passed. Dick is breathing a little more evenly now that he's gotten down three of the crackers and about half the soda, and most of the color has returned to his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what have we learned here?&quot; Jason asks in a faux-sweet voice as he plates up the cooked bacon, but Dick just gives him a withering look.<br />
<br />
Jason passes off the bacon to Cass, who beams back at him, touching her chin with her fingertips and extending her hand forward in the sign for  thanks.  She carries it over to the table and slides in next to Tim to start munching on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;When did Todd arrive?&quot;<br />
<br />
For the goddamn  fourth time that night, Jason startles at the voice of their newest intruder, and he drops the now-cooked lobster that he was fishing out of the pot with a pair of tongs straight back into the boiling liquid. It splashes back up at his hand and he shakes it, cursing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone's jumpy,&quot; Tim snorts.<br />
<br />
A bitter part of Jason nearly snaps back that  yeah, that's what fucking happens when you've spent the last sixteen days held in some bunker being mildly tortured for information, but that's also not really something he wants to get into at the moment, so he settles for a glare.<br />
<br />
Damian steps further into the kitchen, and Jason can see now that he's holding Alfred the cat, stroking his fur absently. He side-eyes Jason. &quot;Are you cooking Father's birthday lobster?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Bad week,&quot; Jason answers through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Tt,&quot; Damian lets out a tiny scoff, but it's lacking its usual heat. He crosses the kitchen and climbs up onto the bench next to Dick, Alfred still clutched tightly in his arms, then leans his head up against Dick's good shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;...Dames?&quot; Dick asks quietly, but Damian just shakes his head, eyes closed, so Dick wraps his arm around him and starts gently rubbing his back.<br />
<br />
Jason catches Tim's gaze and they both exchange a look of  what the fuck? <br />
<br />
Cass makes eye contact with Jason and slowly lifts one hand up in front of her mouth, palm in, fingers in a claw shape. She twists it outward.  Hot.  Then she makes a c-shape with the same hand and circles it on top of the opposite fist.  Chocolate. <br />
<br />
Jason frowns at her. And then all of a sudden, it clicks.<br />
<br />
He nods back and starts the kettle going again. <br />
<br />
(After all, even  Jason  still has nightmares about his time with the League.)<br />
<br />
While Dick whispers quietly in Damian's ear, Jason spends the next few minutes working on the thermidor, adding the mushrooms and some cream to the lobster stock and starting to reduce it over the heat. Cass slips out of her seat and comes over to help, so Jason points at the diagrams in the cookbook which show how to split the lobster shells to remove the meat and she rolls up her sleeves and gets to work. <br />
<br />
Tim, meanwhile, pulls out his phone and starts scrolling idly through it. On the surface, he appears totally indifferent, but Jason's known him long enough to realize that's just how he gives people space when they need it. <br />
<br />
(Jason's suspicions are further confirmed when he comes over to place a mug of cocoa down in front of Damian and classical music begins playing very softly from the kitchen's speakers--Tim still not glancing up from the glowing screen.)<br />
<br />
Overall, it's quite peaceful. That is, until Jason nearly shits himself when he turns around to see a blonde-haired face above the sink.<br />
<br />
Stephanie waves at him, smiling brightly. Open up,  she mouths through the window, pointing up at the locking mechanism.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh  fuck  no.&quot; He reaches up for the cord and pulls the blinds closed.<br />
<br />
There's a moment's pause, and then he hears knuckles rapping against the glass.<br />
<br />
Heaving out a sigh, Jason opens the blinds again. Stephanie makes a pouting face at him as he unlatches the window. <br />
<br />
&quot;Rude,&quot; she remarks as she swings her legs over and climbs in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you, Blondie,&quot; Jason mutters. &quot;It's like you're trying to finish me off a second time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's only natural, Zombie Boy.&quot; She turns to take in the rest of the room. &quot;So what's this, like the world's saddest breakfast club?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason and Tim both wince at that, but Damian just sits up straight and takes a sip of his cocoa with a smirk of amusement. &quot;It is now that you're here, Brown,&quot; he quips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, love you too, Baby Bat,&quot; Stephanie gushes, hopping over to ruffle his hair. <br />
<br />
Damian scowls and shakes the hair back into place.<br />
<br />
&quot;So to what do we owe the pleasure of this visit?&quot; Jason asks in a deadpan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I was actually coming here for Cass,&quot; Stephanie explains, causing the other girl to poke her head up from the lobster. &quot;We've been texting all night 'cus I was up writing my Econ paper, and then like, an hour ago, I sent her a  burning philosophical question, and she left me on  read,&quot;  she says, narrowing her gaze in Cass's direction. &quot;And she hasn't answered a single text since.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Cass shrugs, looking a little sheepish. &quot;Busy.&quot; She inclines her head down to the lobster shell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, speaking of that, why the heck are you two  shucking a lobster at five in the morning?&quot; she demands. <br />
<br />
Cass nods sideways to the open cookbook, so Steph walks over to peer over Cass's shoulder at it. &quot;Oh.&quot; Her brow wrinkles up. &quot;Is this like, some kind of birthday surprise?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason snorts. &quot;In a manner of speaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting.&quot; She turns back to the room. &quot;Anyway, it's actually great  that you're all up because now we have enough people for a whole philosophical  debate.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What's the burning question?&quot; Tim croaks.<br />
<br />
Stephanie grins widely. &quot;Whether or not Spider-Man would stick to a non-stick pan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason blinks at her. Then he points back at the window. &quot;Get out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, but I just got here!&quot; She places her hands on the counter behind her and pushes herself up to sit on top of it. &quot;I wanna hear all of your arguments.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I'll bite. What kind of non-stick pan?&quot; Dick asks, looking genuinely thoughtful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I dunno.&quot; Stephanie shrugs. &quot;Let's say teflon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Teflon is shit,&quot; Jason scoffs, getting out another mug. &quot;It scrapes off if you scratch it with a fork. He'd definitely stick to teflon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let's say ceramic then,&quot; she amends. <br />
<br />
&quot;What's the surface area of the pan?&quot; Tim asks tiredly.<br />
<br />
Damian frowns. &quot;Why would that matter, Drake? Spider-Man  himself has a limited surface area with which to adhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He has a fever, Dami, be nice...&quot; Dick mutters under his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No it would still matter.&quot; Tim looks up, brow pinched in confusion. &quot;Wait... wouldn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick pats his arm. &quot;It's okay, Tim.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cass clears her throat sharply, diverting everyone's attention over to her. She's holding the handle of a non-stick pan in each hand, using them to chop at the air, karate style. Atop her head, a third pan is balanced upside down like a hat. &quot;Greatest enemy. Pan-Man,&quot; she declares with a grin.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Yes!&quot;  Stephanie exclaims happily.  &quot;Now we're getting somewhere!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason hands her a mug of hot chocolate. &quot;Here, join Breakfast Club.&quot;<br />
<br />
She winces, sucking in a breath through her teeth. &quot;Ooh, I would, but I'm only eating raw foods this week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But this isn't a food,&quot; Jason argues. &quot;It's a beverage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeahhh... but I think it still counts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick frowns at her. &quot;Steph, you're not doing one of those weird detox cleanses are you? Because they can be really unhealthy in the long run if-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax!&quot; She laughs, holding up her hands in a placating gesture. &quot;It's not a cleanse, okay? It's a  bet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bet?&quot; Tim repeats skeptically. <br />
<br />
&quot;This really annoying guy from my statistics class, Kevin Nelson, bet me fifty bucks I couldn't go raw vegan for a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you see Kevin Nelson here?&quot; Jason scoffs, gesturing around the kitchen. &quot;Because I sure don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie rolls her eyes. &quot;Sheesh, it's called  integrity, Jason. I intend to win this fifty bucks fair and square.&quot; She glances over to Cass and grins. &quot;And then the two of us are gonna use them to go hit up House of 'Que downtown for two slabs of baby back ribs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cass licks her lips, touching her middle finger and thumb together before pulling them away from her mouth. Delicious.<br />
<br />
Damian rolls his eyes, muttering something about  omnivores  and  weakness. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine then,&quot; Jason huffs. He plucks a banana from the hanging fruit basket and chucks it at her head. &quot;Happy Breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
The banana bounces off Stephanie's elbow and she has to fumble to catch it. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she says cheerily, already starting to unpeel it. &quot;I appreciate the support.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, is this still the night shift?&quot;<br />
<br />
(Jason is pleased to report that he does  not  startle when Duke suddenly enters the room.)<br />
<br />
(Well, at least not  much.) <br />
<br />
&quot;It's the  madrugada  shift,&quot; Stephanie replies. &quot;Which reminds me, Jay-&quot; She looks over at him, sticking her lip out in a pout. &quot;You said you were gonna help me with my Spanish homework this semester.&quot;<br />

            <td class="column21 style0 s">It had been somewhat of a slow day. No invasions, no crazed CEOs, no nuclear reactors about to blow. All in all Earth was relatively safe, but that didn't mean that the Justice League had the day off. &quot;Vigilantism requires vigilance&quot; as Batman always said, no matter how many times they pointed out that not all of them were vigilantes. So, on this quiet day, the World's Finest sat in the Watchtower keeping a lookout for trouble.<br />
<br />
<br />
They were so bored.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, little did they know a bit of downtime can bring about some of the most exciting and earth shattering revelations.<br />
<br />
<br />
The group sat in the lounge. On the couch Green Lantern and the Flash were playing videogames, shouting and laughing loudly despite their proximity to Martian Manhunter, who was sitting in an armchair with a book and insisting he didn't mind the noise whenever someone barked at the two gaming heroes to show some courtesy. Green Arrow and Aquaman were locked in a heated game of Connect Four along with Black Canary who had come over after Martian Manhunter concluded their game of chess and went to his book. She was mainly watching the two men, amused at their concentration, but she would on occasion make a suggestion or two to help Aquaman much to Green Arrow's chagrin. Superman was sat at the Tower supercomputer reading the latest news articles and scribbling down notes on various video clips. Wonder Woman was down on Earth accepting an award, and the League had lost track of Batman's whereabouts hours ago. All in all it was an unremarkable day. That was until they overheard the swoosh of a zeta tube.<br />
<br />
<br />
The heroes initially didn't pay much attention to the sound. They assumed it was Batman coming back from wherever he had skulked off to, bringing in more of his seemingly unending supply of files to pour over. Even on these slow days he worked incessantly. Green Lantern and Flash had suggested more than once that under the cowl the Bat was actually an android with no need for sleep or enrichment. The others were less convinced, but at times the theory did seem plausible, and so it was no surprise to see him coming and going from the Tower on a day off with more work for himself. What did throw them for a loop was the sound that came after the zeta's rush.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So I think that he's really working on some kind of giganto-ultra charged-high tech-super ray that'll blow up anything it hits into a bunch of ice shards,&quot; a voice said, younger and much more animated than the Bat's. The Dark Knight himself was still clearly present though as one of his signature grunts of acknowledgement followed the young stranger's theory. The head of every League member snapped up towards the sounds, frozen in shock and anticipation.<br />
<br />
<br />
As the voice got closer the questions bouncing between the team's consciousnesses intensified. This couldn't be an intruder or else Batman would have incapacitated them immediately instead of waltzing them into the Tower. It didn't make sense for the stranger to be a victim though either; firstly the only way Batman would ever bring anyone to the Watchtower would be if they needed something inside it which he didn't have on him, and no one could think of anything that could help any injured or frightened person that Batman didn't already have in that impossibly well stocked utility belt of his. Secondly this person sounded enthusiastic and energetic, not like the victim of some sort of attack. And finally had there been an attack anywhere in the world the League would have been there instead of twiddling their thumbs up in their space clubhouse. This was something else all together, but what?<br />
<br />
<br />
Their questions only multiplied as the stranger stepped into view, following Batman into the room still chattering away. The boy could not have been older than about sixteen and he was wearing some sort of hero suit, red and black with yellow belts crossing his chest and a long black cape flowing behind him. He had a golden insignia on his chest and the top line of his black domino mask nearly disappeared into the wisps of the long dark hair hanging down into his face. Whoever he was he had the superhero aesthetic down pat, though his symbol and motives were entirely unknown to the League members currently gawking at him. Perhaps most confusing and unsettling about this scenario was that Batman seemed entirely unphased. He merely listened to the young man chatter about his ray gun theory, taking a moment to nod a curt greeting to the astounded League before continuing to walk by. Luckily for the team the boy noticed them and stopped. He beamed excitedly and turned to the Bat again.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't tell me they were going to be here!&quot; he grinned. The boy looked ecstatic as he waved to the group, and Aquaman swore he thought he saw the Bat's lip twitch upwards for a second as well. &quot;Hi!&quot; the boy said, &quot;Wow it's really awesome to meet you guys. Big fan all round.&quot; His demeanor relaxed significantly when he saw Superman, and the others suddenly noticed that the Man of Steel did not seem as surprised as they did. &quot;Hey Supes,&quot; chimed the boy and to the rest of the League's shock Superman answered as familiarly.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey kiddo, what'cha doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We're gonna run a redacted file through the electron topography scanner so we can read it. Hood busted the one in the Cave,&quot; he laughed suddenly. &quot;He nailed it with a batarang trying to hit a spider.&quot; Superman laughed with him.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds about right,&quot; he quipped, making the boy laugh harder. &quot;I thought yall fixed that though.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; the boy smiled as he caught his breath, &quot;that was when Nightwing jammed it trying to read a note O scribbled over. He was hoping it was a love note and evidently glitter pens set the system on the fritz. Turned out to be a grocery list anyway and now she won't let him live it down.&quot; As Superman and the young stranger chuckled about this mysterious gaggle of technologically challenged friends of theirs, Green Arrow became the first of the League to find his voice.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, hold on, what's happening?&quot; He pointed back and forth between the boy and Superman. &quot;Do you two know each other?&quot; The boy nodded. &quot;How? Are you- or what are- who-&quot; He was mercifully cut off my Martian Manhunter.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's start at the beginning,&quot; he said warmly. &quot;What is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Red Robin,&quot; the boy answered with a smile, &quot;it's nice to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It is nice to meet you as well. Are you working with Batman on a case of some kind?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we've been working on it a couple weeks now but we just got this file.&quot; Aquaman was next to speak.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what, you're like...an intern?&quot; Red Robin laughed.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He wishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not,&quot; Batman huffed as the boy grinned. &quot;He's my son.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The room erupted into chaos.<br />
<br />
<br />
After a few moments the Bat was able to quiet them down enough to have some semblance of an organized conversation.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;How could you not tell us you had a kid?&quot; Green Lantern shouted, but he couldn't help but regret it as he saw the look on the boy's face.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't tell them?&quot; he asked the Bat, clearly offended. Batman opened his mouth to explain but quickly closed it, his eyes widening slightly as though with fear. Stunned, that's when the rest of them noticed Red Robin's face had changed as well from offence to something darker and sealed with a grin. &quot;Wait,&quot; he purred, &quot;A kid?&quot; He turned around to the group with a look that was almost wolfish, plotting his next strike carefully for maximum impact. &quot;Then I guess he hasn't told you about the rest of us, has he?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The League's screaming was only able to be finally silenced by Canary's.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Let the kid speak,&quot; she chided as they all held their ears. &quot;Now, please, do go on about the rest of your family,&quot; she smiled slyly, casting a glance over at Batman who looked very much as though he was trying to psychically summon an alarm on the warning system to disperse this conversation. He mouthed a soft &quot;why&quot; at her, and despite the fact that his back was to the Bat, Red Robin answered the silent question. Oh yeah, this was Spooky's kid alright.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Colored bird solidarity, B,&quot; he grinned. Black Canary laughed and Batman just rolled his eyes. Insufferably (if you asked the Dark Knight standing behind him) satisfied with himself, the young vigilante sought to answer the heroine's question as thoughtfully as he could. &quot;Now, who do you want to know about? The world famous performer? The hacker extraordinaire? The one that glows in the dark? The OTHER one that glows in the dark?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Signal does not glow in the dark,&quot; Batman cut in wearily.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh he did last week,&quot; Red Robin shot back.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; the Bat asked, sounding genuinely surprised.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it was so cool. It's a new thing, he's not sure how he did it. But enough about that, I'm sure these lovely friends of yours all want to hear more about the rest of Gotham's finest. How about the trained-by-assassins-trio? Or the MI-6 spy? Or my Punk's-not-dead-but-you're-about-to-be sister? Why don't I tell you guys about my jewel thief stepmother?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;She's not his stepmother,&quot; Batman interjected gruffly.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;She's about to be,&quot; Red Robin beamed. &quot;Or why don't we get into the matter of the illegitimate demon love child? Or my brother the crime boss? Or the crime fighting starfish? Though it's important to point out that he is not part of the menagerie of farm animals that live in their own wing of the mansion.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Red Robin,&quot; the Bat sighed desperately.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no B, you had your chance to brag on us and you missed it, so now I get to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He's got a point you know,&quot; Superman commented, prompting another deep sigh from the Dark Knight.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The entire League, save Batman and Superman, was listening with rapt attention, their shock steadily growing past what they had known was possible, when suddenly the Tower phone rang. Batman, thankful for the reprieve, walked over to answer it.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; He turned to the rest of the group. &quot;It's Wonder Woman,&quot; he called out. Instantly he was accosted by a gust of wind and found the phone was no longer in his hand. Flash put it on the table and pushed the button for speaker phone.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Batman has a whole bunch of kids and he brought one of them up to the Tower!&quot; he shouted. The Amazon's strong voice rang through the receiver out into the room.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wonderful, which one? I know Spoiler has been desperately wanting to visit.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Even the resounding shouts and chaos could not drown out Red Robin's laugh.</td>

Jessica had more strength than any other enhanced skill or ability; as such, she could hear moderately well. Better than the average person, certainly. She liked to tell Luke she could hear better than he could.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, her hearing wasn't good enough to hear Daredevil when he decided to land softly beside her, thus scaring the absolute shit out of her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, Jones,&quot; he told her. His voice was deep, gruff, gravelly; there was also absolutely <br />
<br />
no way <br />
<br />
that it was his real voice. &quot;If you're always on edge, you'll never get anything done.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jessica snorted. &quot;Thanks for the tips. What are you, my teacher?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Mr. Daredevil, but I think I've already graduated vigilante school,&quot; Jessica continued, as Luke scaled the side of the building and settled next to Jessica on the roof. &quot;Hey, big guy. Where's Danny?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, no real names,&quot; Daredevil growled. Jessica rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ, dude, lighten up,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't even <br />
<br />
have <br />
<br />
a vigilante name.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of us have identities to protect,&quot; Daredevil told her. Danny landed beside her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the only one who won't tell us who you are,&quot; Danny reminded him. &quot;And, you know, at the risk of sounding conceited, I can't imagine you're better-known than I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless he's Tony Stark,&quot; Luke suggested. Jessica eyed Daredevil.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't think so,&quot; she stated. Daredevil frowned, as far as she could tell in the dark, and with his mask. &quot;Oh, man, you gotta <br />
<br />
lighten up, <br />
<br />
Daredevil. You'll never get anywhere like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Now who's teaching at vigilante school?&quot; Danny teased. He flexed his fingers, a glow starting to hum up around his wrist before he shook it off. &quot;Anyways, I think we're done ganging up on Daredevil. City seems like it's good for tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll meet you tomorrow,&quot; Daredevil said, the moment Danny was done talking.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Same bat time, same bat channel,&quot; Danny said, and Daredevil nodded and took off at a spring, leaping from the roof they were on to the next, eventually vanishing from sight down an alley. The three of them watched him disappear, in silence for a long moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Luke said. &quot;Do you think he ever smiles?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Danny laughed, dropping down to sit cross-legged on the ground. &quot;I honestly, <br />
<br />
honestly <br />
<br />
don't. I don't even think I've ever heard him laugh. Do you think he has any friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we his only friends?&quot; Luke added. Jessica sat down next to Danny, letting him comb his fingers through her hair. Luke paced to the edge of the roof, glancing down to the empty streets.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We might be,&quot; Jessica answered. &quot;He's always the first to suggest we meet earlier, stay later.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Extra training,&quot; Danny added.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Secret identities.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Assigned <br />
<br />
defense sectors.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So, the guy's a little weird,&quot; Luke interrupted. &quot;He's not <br />
<br />
that <br />
<br />
bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He's got a stick up his ass,&quot; Jessica said. &quot;God help anyone he knows in his real life.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I think this <br />
<br />
is <br />
<br />
his real life,&quot; Danny suggested. The three of them were quiet for a moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I hope he's happy,&quot; Luke said, finally.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there such a thing as a vigilante who's <br />
<br />
too<br />
<br />
&nbsp;dark and broody?&quot; Danny asked, letting Luke give him a hand up. Jessica hopped to her feet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If there is,&quot; Jessica said, &quot;the horns on his head don't help me take him seriously.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Luke laughed before launching Jessica to the ground, Danny after her, chattering about where they should get their incredibly late dinner/obscenely early breakfast. She glanced down the direction Daredevil disappeared, letting her mind drift for a moment, wondering about who he might be, before Luke caught her attention again, and she forgot all about him.<br />
<br />
<br />
The next night was a golden opportunity at a glance into Daredevil's personal life.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it came at the price of Daredevil getting injured, and Jessica, Luke, and Danny all insisting* that he tell them where he lived so they could get him home safe (*read: essentially forcing). The mugger that had gotten in one good jab was already unconscious, and Danny had called the police to come pick him up. The hinge in Daredevil's armor by his left hip had taken the blow, though Jessica had already yanked the knife free and was using her scarf to apply pressure to the wound.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you <br />
<br />
have <br />
<br />
to tell us where to bring you, or else you're just gonna bleed out in the street over a stupid little stab,&quot; Jessica said, <br />
<br />
again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Luke had Daredevil hoisted up in a bridal carry, but the guy's attention seemed hyper-focused on Jessica and her prodding.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Just leave me, I'll figure it out,&quot; Daredevil insisted, for the thirtieth time. Danny groaned loudly, zip-tying the unconscious mugger to the dumpster.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, Daredevil,&quot; Danny snapped. &quot;If you don't tell us where you live, I'm gonna take you to the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Daredevil hesitated.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Which one?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely the opposite of whichever one you want to go to,&quot; Danny said. Luke readjusted his grip and motioned for them to leave the alley.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We gotta go,&quot; he told them. Daredevil's hands twitched towards his hip, but he left Jessica's hands alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Daredevil said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. <br />
<br />
Fine. It's fine.&quot; He rattled off an address deep in Hell's Kitchen and flinched when Jessica released him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Run,&quot; Jessica instructed Luke, and the three of them took off, Daredevil pushing Jessica's scarf into his knife wound. He insisted, now and then, that he was fine, but now that Jessica had an address, she wasn't stopping come hell or high water.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
His apartment building - assuming it was his and not some empty apartment he was squatting in that he'd led them to - was an okay place. Not the nicest, but not the worst. He motioned for Luke to put him down on the doorstep and leaned in to press one of the call buttons next to the door.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; a man's voice asked, and Daredevil leaned in.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's me,&quot; Daredevil said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you forget your key again?&quot; the guy asked, and the door buzzed and opened. &quot;You're ridiculous. Get up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got company,&quot; Daredevil said, softly, like the three superhumans behind him wouldn't hear it. Luke already had the door open. There was a moment of silence.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Good or bad?&quot; the guy asked. Daredevil twitched.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;They're the guys I work with,&quot; he eventually settled on. The guy laughed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, come on up,&quot; he said, and the line clicked off. Daredevil shuffled ahead of them, shimmied past Luke into the building, and led them to a rickety elevator. The four of them rode in silence, but Jessica could see that Danny was brimming with excitement at whatever this was going to reveal for them. The guy already sounded <br />
<br />
way <br />
<br />
too good for Daredevil.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm in 407,&quot; he told them, leading them without seeming to glance at any of the doors on the way there. He leaned to the left, limping, but otherwise made his way just fine. Jessica still kept an eye on him. The door to 407 opened just as Daredevil was about to knock on it, revealing a blonde guy on the other side, wearing matching pajamas, looking just as eager as Danny did.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well, well, what have we here?&quot; the guy said. Daredevil leaned in the doorway, letting the guy lean in and kiss him on the cheek.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kiss him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On the <br />
<br />
cheek.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jessica glanced back at Danny, who had lit up like it was Christmas come early.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I got hurt,&quot; Daredevil told the guy, his voice already a little less gruff than it usually was with them. The guy frowned at him, already starting to look for a wound. &quot;Left hip. I got a knife wound, but it's really shallow, so I-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't listen to him,&quot; Jessica interrupted. &quot;Luke carried him basically all the way here.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, are we back to the lying, then?&quot; the guy asked Daredevil, and Danny rubbed at his face with his hand to hide his smile. Luke's lips twitched. &quot;Get in. All of you. I started a pot of coffee when you got here so help yourselves.&quot; He pointed at Daredevil. &quot;You. On the couch.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; Daredevil asked, and it was the closest thing to a joke or a tease that Jessica had ever heard from him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I'm pointing right at you,&quot; the guy said. &quot;Don't act like you don't already know that, you bat. Get inside, get on the couch, and take off the costume.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Daredevil stopped in his tracks, turning back towards the guy a little bit. Danny was already at the coffee pot, pouring out five mugs, looking like this night was greater than any show on television.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't take off my costume, Fo- Uhm. I can't,&quot; he said. Jessica raised an eyebrow, accepting the coffee from Luke when he handed it to her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Coffee cream's in the fridge, sugar's in the blue jar on the counter,&quot; the guy told them, shutting his front door. &quot;You most certainly <br />
<br />
can <br />
<br />
take it off. Halloween is over and you got stabbed. Off.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But-&quot; His head swiveled in the direction of Luke, Jessica, and Danny standing in the tiny kitchen. &quot;I-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;They're your friends, aren't they?&quot; the guy asked him. &quot;That's what you told me.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, you told him we're your friends?&quot; Danny said, clutching at his heart. &quot;I'm touched.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We have <br />
<br />
secret identities,&quot; <br />
<br />
Daredevil said meaningfully, ignoring Danny entirely.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jesus Christ, you and your secret identity,&quot; the guy said. He turned to the kitchen. &quot;Hi, I'm Foggy Nelson-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Foggy-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a <br />
<br />
pleasure <br />
<br />
to meet you,&quot; Foggy Nelson continued, like Daredevil hadn't even spoken. He held out a hand, and Danny leaned forward, grasping it firmly and shaking just as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Danny Rand,&quot; he said. &quot;Yeah, the same Rand that you're probably thinking of.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, he's definitely more important than you, buddy,&quot; Foggy said over his shoulder to Daredevil. He returned his attention to Danny. &quot;Pleasure.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Same here,&quot; Danny said, releasing him. Foggy turned to Luke, who took his hand gently.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Luke Cage,&quot; he said, and Foggy laughed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, I know you,&quot; Foggy said. &quot;I've seen you on TV. You're a good man, Luke Cage.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Luke said, letting Foggy turn to Jessica.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you must be Jessica Jones,&quot; Foggy said, and Jessica grinned, grabbing his hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Does Daredevil talk about me off the clock?&quot; Jessica asked, and Foggy laughed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You kidding? He loves you guys,&quot; Foggy said, and Daredevil groaned behind him. Danny beamed. &quot;Do they even know your real name, man?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Daredevil snapped. &quot;Can I have some help, please?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Is your dumbass costume off?&quot; Foggy asked, turning back to him as he collapsed on the sofa. Foggy tsked at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Take it off. I won't help until you do, and you know Claire's been teaching me first aid.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Claire?&quot; Danny asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Claire Temple?&quot; Luke asked. Foggy turned around in surprise.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, do you know her?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;She's our team nurse,&quot; Jessica told him. Foggy laughed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;They know <br />
<br />
Claire <br />
<br />
but they don't know your fuckin' name,&quot; Foggy said, leaning over and starting to undo Daredevil's armor for him. &quot;You're ridiculous.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You're <br />
<br />
ridiculous,&quot; Daredevil grumbled. He let Foggy undress him down to his tight fitness pants and undershirt, his mask and helmet coming off last. Jessica grinned.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, he's cute,&quot; Danny commented. &quot;Look at him.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave the guy alone,&quot; Luke said, smiling. &quot;He wants to be scary.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;See, Matt? They like you,&quot; Foggy said, fishing a first aid kit out from under his coffee table. Daredevil - <br />
<br />
Matt <br />
<br />
- groaned, as Danny laughed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, his name's Matt?&quot; Jessica said, as Danny exclaimed, &quot;He's a frat boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not,&quot; Matt grumbled. He stared absently up at the ceiling as Foggy separated his pants and shirt to examine his wound.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not that deep,&quot; Foggy announced, &quot;but I'm gonna clean it out and do a butterfly on it. How's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Matt said, still staring. Foggy didn't seem too bothered by his unwillingness to meet anyone's eyes. Jessica approached slowly, leaning over the back of the couch to meet Matt's eye. He refused to. She frowned, tilting closer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it look worse than I thought?&quot; Foggy asked. She glanced at him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, sorry, not you.&quot; She leaned back, and Matt smiled, just a little. It was the first time she had <br />
<br />
ever <br />
<br />
seen him smile.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;She doesn't know,&quot; Matt said, unnecessarily cryptic. Foggy's brow furrowed, looking confused for a moment, before he apparently caught on and laughed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You're an asshole,&quot; Foggy said. &quot;Is this another dumb secret you're trying to keep?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I plead the fifth,&quot; Matt replied, and Foggy grinned.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;That'll never hold up in the Nelson and Murdock Home Court,&quot; Foggy teased. He returned his attention to Jessica. &quot;He's blind.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He's <br />
<br />
what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Danny blurted - before he could stop himself, apparently. Luke thumped him on the back of the head. Jessica waved a hand in front of Matt's eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk about a well-kept secret,&quot; Luke commented. Matt smiled again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You can stop doing that, Jessica,&quot; Matt said. Jessica snatched her hand back.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You're blind,&quot; she repeated, and he raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;And?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;How'd you know what I was doing?&quot; she clarified.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He's basically a bat,&quot; Foggy offered. &quot;He's got sonar or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a <br />
<br />
world on fire-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, yeah, if you wanna be a drama queen about it,&quot; Foggy interrupted. &quot;Hold still, this is gonna hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Matt clenched his jaw as the alcohol hit his open wound. He turned his head in Jessica's direction. &quot;So, now you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Nelson and Murdock,&quot; Luke said, interrupting whatever Matt was leading up to. Jessica frowned in his direction. &quot;You're Matt Murdock.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Matt said, tense.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You two have saved half the asses in the city,&quot; Luke continued. Matt relaxed, and Foggy laughed. &quot;Thank you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks needed,&quot; Foggy insisted. &quot;But, please, leave us a review on Yelp. A comment like that from Luke Cage can only help business.&quot; He withdrew his alcohol swabs from Matt's side and pinched a butterfly bandage over his clean skin. &quot;There you go, buddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Fog,&quot; Matt said, shifting to sit up. Foggy brushed his hand over Matt's side as he tugged his shirt down, and Matt actually <br />
<br />
laughed. <br />
<br />
Out <br />
<br />
loud. <br />
<br />
Jessica glanced over her shoulder at the twin incredulous looks on Luke's and Danny's faces, an expression she was sure was mirrored on her own.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jesus, they look shocked,&quot; Foggy said. &quot;What did you do to them?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think I've ever seen him smile before,&quot; Danny offered. Foggy laughed; it honestly seemed like this guy felt joy a thousand times more often than Matt did.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He's the biggest softie I know,&quot; Foggy told them. &quot;He cried watching <br />
<br />
The Fox and the Hound <br />
<br />
last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Foggy,&quot; <br />
<br />
Matt growled, but Foggy just brushed Matt's mess of hair away from his eyes and grinned.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;As much as you can watch something, anyway,&quot; Foggy continued, and Matt laughed again, despite himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you, Foggy,&quot; Matt said, leaning gingerly against the back of the couch. He groaned, shifting, and settled. Foggy grabbed a blanket off the arm of the chair behind him and draped it over Matt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, fellas, I hate to cut this party short, but even Daredevil needs his rest,&quot; Foggy said. Jessica finally snapped out of her trance, feeling more like an audience to the world's most confusing magic show than anything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem,&quot; Luke said, while Danny and Jessica attempted to recover.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you guys come over before you head out tomorrow night?&quot; Foggy offered. Matt groaned, covering his face with his hands. &quot;Oh, chill out, Murdock. I can make enough for everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;That's <br />
<br />
why you never want to get dinner with us,&quot; Danny exclaimed. Luke smiled.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you've never even offered?&quot; Foggy said to Matt. &quot;You <br />
<br />
dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;They didn't even know my name before you ruined my mystique,&quot; Matt grumbled, smiling. Foggy smacked his knee.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have any mystique,&quot; Foggy told him. &quot;You're about as mysterious as I am.&quot; He turned to Jessica. &quot;Come by tomorrow around seven, I'll have food for all of you. Any allergies?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't have tree nuts,&quot; Danny offered, and Foggy grabbed a pen off his coffee table and scribbled <br />
<br />
tree nuts <br />
<br />
on his arm.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it.&quot; He stood, offering a handshake to each of the other three Defenders again before showing them to the door. Once they were in the hall, he leaned out, sliding the door shut slightly behind him. &quot;Thank you for bringing him back. And for working with him at night. It makes me feel better to know he's not out there alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, anytime,&quot; Luke said. Jessica grinned and clapped a hand on Foggy's shoulder.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We love working with Matt,&quot; she told him, and Danny leaned in closer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And we'll love it even more now,&quot; Danny said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please <br />
<br />
start preparing any and all embarrassing stories about Matt to tell us tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll break out his diary,&quot; Foggy joked, and Matt yelled something indecipherable from inside their apartment. Foggy grinned. &quot;See you tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;See you,&quot; they said, leaving Foggy to vanish back into his apartment, the door clicking shut behind him. Danny immediately punched the air.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He's so cute!&quot; Danny exclaimed softly. &quot;He's a normal guy!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He has the ability to smile,&quot; Jessica commented.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a nice person,&quot; Luke added.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;His boyfriend is <br />
<br />
cute,&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Danny continued. &quot;And their coffee cream is so nice!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;None of their furniture matches,&quot; Luke said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he <br />
<br />
is <br />
<br />
blind,&quot; Jessica replied.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I can still hear you!&quot; Matt called from inside the apartment, sending Danny into hysterics. Luke dragged him down the hall to the elevator, Jessica trailing them both, hands in her pockets, grinning away. She was already planning the training sessions her and Matt were going to have once he was all better and could show her exactly <br />
<br />
how <br />
<br />
that sonar thing worked. <br />

<br />
<br />
Arthur is sunlight, warmth. He is big and shining and golden, so golden that sometimes it's like Merlin can warm his hands just in the glow around him.<br />
<br />
Merlin loves him fiercely.<br />
<br />
Merlin is moonlight and he's always cold, especially at night. They're out on a long hunt, one night, sleeping on the ground, and Merlin shivers and shivers and shivers and tries not to toss and turn, because Arthur's so damned alert and he'll notice.<br />
<br />
Then Arthur sits suddenly, in the firelit darkness, and lunges, and pulls Merlin into his warm embrace. Merlin struggles, startled, but Arthur holds him firmly until he goes still and submits. 'That's better,' he says softly, 'you're freezing, you idiot,' and arranges Merlin to his satisfaction.<br />
<br />
He's so warm, so beautifully big and warm, and Merlin lets out an involuntary little sound of content, burrowing a little bit into Arthur's chest, his face pressed into Arthur's shirt and neck. Arthur gives a low laugh, the sound humming soothingly past Merlin's ear, and tightens his arms around him. 'Better?'<br />
<br />
'Yes,' Merlin whispers, already slipping off to sleep; and he could almost imagine that before the darkness rolled over him, he felt the touch of lips, softly, on his hair.<br />
<br />
Merlin is soft and gentle and not at all a fighter, and it sometimes makes Arthur want to shake him in frustration, but mostly just protect him.<br />
<br />
Arthur is hard, and strong, and trained to fight, to hunt, to protect with the sword; but Merlin is something else entirely. Merlin nurtures things and cares for them and worries about them, and Arthur is fascinated by it.<br />
<br />
Merlin likes unicorns. And flowers. And children - Arthur sees him go down on one knee next to a little lost crying toddler, and coax her into watery smiles, and then lift her up in his arms and take her home to her mother, little arms clinging trustingly around his neck. He never knew that Arthur had watched him.<br />
<br />
Arthur's training the next day, and he stops and turns to see where Merlin is sitting on the bench, and Merlin's long smooth neck is craned up at the sky and he's smiling vaguely. Arthur follows his eyes, and there's a small wheeling bird, high in the blue heavens, dipping and circling and swooping without apparent intent.<br />
<br />
Arthur brings his sword and puts it down; he's had enough of the practice dummy anyway. He comes and sits down, not on the bench but on the ground at Merlin's feet, and there's something oddly intimate about it. He twists his head back and up to look at Merlin, and Merlin's not looking at the bird now, but at Arthur, the little smile still dreaming at the corner of his mouth. And it feels right.<br />
<br />
'Good training?' Merlin says softly, and he reaches out to straighten the neck of Arthur's tunic where it's bunched itself up under the mail shirt. His fingers feel cool and good against Arthur's sweaty skin.<br />
<br />
'Good,' Arthur confirms, and leans back against the bench, his head level with Merlin's leg. He runs a hand through his damp hair, making it stick up in sweaty spikes; and then Merlin laughs and blows a cool stream of air onto him.<br />
<br />
'Ahh,' Arthur says happily. 'That's good. Do it again.'<br />
<br />
'Yes, sire,' Merlin says. 'Your personal fan, that's me.'<br />
<br />
'It's an honour, Merlin,' Arthur says lazily.<br />
<br />
Merlin blows gently on him again, long and cool, and then says, soft and provocative, 'Prat.'<br />
<br />
Arthur lunges at him, and Merlin writhes away, almost out of reach, but Arthur's battle reflexes don't betray him and they end up wrestling all over the grass, laughing breathlessly. Inevitably, Arthur prevails, and ends up pinning Merlin to the ground, triumphantly grinning down at him. 'Yield,' he says firmly.<br />
<br />
Merlin stops struggling and drops his head back, still laughing. 'All right, I yield,' he says meekly; and as Arthur releases his arms, Merlin reaches out with an easy movement and gently brushes the hair out of Arthur's eyes.<br />
<br />
Arthur is day, and light, and openness, and he's really rather terrible at keeping secrets considering that he's the Prince of Camelot. Sometimes he looks into Merlin's eyes, and his blue eyes are so honest and frank and open that Merlin's heart aches with his own burden of hoarded secrets.<br />
<br />
(It is those times that Merlin must close himself up, tight, tight, like a locked chest in a vault, because he knows it would be so, so easy to let it all come spilling out at Arthur's feet.)<br />
<br />
Merlin is dark soothing night, and he closes himself up and keeps his secrets because he must.<br />
<br />
But one day, they're out riding in the woods, bantering, and it's so stupid, the kind of inane freakish thing that never happens: a tree branch falls, as they're riding beneath it. And it's heading straight down on top of Arthur, and Merlin reacts on instinct, feeling his eyes glow warm with released magic - knocking the branch away from Arthur. Away from his beautiful Arthur, whom he loves more than his life and his secrets.<br />
<br />
Arthur sees. Of course Arthur sees, and when the horses have stopped rearing and quietened, he's staring at Merlin as though he's just had a bucket of cold water to the face. Merlin's shivering, thinking of taking the horse and bolting; but he can't, he can't.<br />
<br />
'You're a sorcerer,' Arthur says, blank and obvious.<br />
<br />
'Yes,' Merlin says shakily, and dashes fiercely at the tears that have started to trickle down his face, waiting. Because if Arthur wants to take him back to Camelot as a prisoner, to a cold cell and death in the grey morning - if that is what Arthur wants, Merlin will let him, because he can't deny Arthur anything.<br />
<br />
'You lied to me,' Arthur says quietly, and Merlin presses his knuckles into his mouth and crushes back a dry helpless sob. He can't meet Arthur's eyes, now, too afraid of what he will see in them.<br />
<br />
'Get off your horse.' Arthur's voice is fierce and hard and Merlin must obey, so he does it, climbing off clumsily and waiting with a bowed head. There is silence, and then a little thud, and Merlin glances up for a fraction of a second, and Arthur's off his horse. He's striding towards Merlin with a grim mouth and a tight jaw, and Merlin stiffens and braces his shoulders.<br />
<br />
'God, just - just stop that,' Arthur sounds sick and angry and strange. 'I'm not going to hit you, damn you.' And he takes Merlin's shoulders in a hard, almost bruising grip, and he's breathing hard, and Merlin's crying messily, because he just can't seem to stop and he's more scared than he's ever been in his life.<br />
<br />
And then Arthur's exploding. 'What - WHAT were you THINKING?' he roars, and Merlin gulps and shakes and turns his face away; but Arthur just shouts louder. 'LOOK at me!' - and Merlin has to obey, and he can't understand what he's seeing, because Arthur's face is wet and furious and his mouth is working as though he's trying to stop himself from weeping.<br />
<br />
'You're - crying,' Merlin gulps.<br />
<br />
'Shut up. Shut up,' Arthur snarls. 'You lied to me. You could have died. Every day. Damn you.' And then he yanks Merlin roughly into something that's more like a stranglehold than an embrace, and Merlin cries and cries and cries, his knees failing him, tears and snot and wetness everywhere.<br />
<br />
'Sorry. I'm sorry. So sorry,' he keeps snuffling into Arthur's shirt, and Arthur's chest is heaving spasmodically and his face is pressed hard into a damp patch in Merlin's hair.<br />
<br />
It's a long while they stand there, shuddering and clinging together. Finally, Arthur hauls Merlin out of the way of the horses, to a clear place by a tree, and they collapse against it, rough bark at their backs and twigs poking everywhere and Merlin's long legs getting in the way. Merlin's shuddering and sniffling, trying to wipe his face on his sleeve.<br />
<br />
'Don't,' Arthur says hoarsely, and pins Merlin's arms down, fishing around and coming up with a big handkerchief from a pocket somewhere in his clothes. He tips Merlin's stained face up and starts to dry it off, his own face fierce and wet-eyed.<br />
<br />
'You have to stop crying, you'll be sick,' Arthur says after a moment, as Merlin sobs again, and once more. 'Merlin.'<br />
<br />
Merlin gulps and closes his eyes for a moment, but another sob rises up his throat and the tears are still coming, leaking down his cheeks.<br />
<br />
'Take a deep breath,' Arthur orders. 'Merlin. I want you to obey me, now.'<br />
<br />
Something about Arthur's commands makes the world steady around Merlin, and he keeps his eyes closed and breathes in, and out, and concentrates on the feeling of Arthur's tight hard grip on him. One last tiny sob - 'Merlin,' Arthur says warningly - and he manages to stop crying, though he's still shivering all over.<br />
<br />
'That's much better,' Arthur says approvingly, and Merlin looks at him; and there's something wonderful in Arthur's face, something deep and soft and serious in the way he looks into Merlin's eyes. And Arthur dries Merlin's face with the handkerchief, gently, and holds it for Merlin to blow into, and then puts it back into his own pocket when he's done.<br />
<br />
Then they sit, and after a moment Merlin realises that Arthur is rocking him, slightly, back and forth and back and forth, and that gives him a little bit of courage.<br />
<br />
'Are you - are you going to - to -?' His voice is a tiny thread of sound, but Arthur hears; and Arthur seems to curl himself over and around Merlin as though protecting him with his body.<br />
<br />
'Am I going to turn you in to my father?' he says quietly. 'Merlin.'<br />
<br />
And he leans down and presses his forehead against Merlin's, and speaks, slow and clear but very soft. 'Listen to me. You are mine, and I protect what is mine with the last drop of my blood. Do you trust me?'<br />
<br />
And Merlin gives a deep shaking sigh, and presses back against Arthur's forehead, trembling. His eyes meet and hold Arthur's, and he listens to the soft soothing sounds of their mingled breathing, and whispers, 'Yes.'<br />
<br />
Chapter 2 coming soon! In which there will be a reveal of another kind...<br />
<br />
Song choice: A Love Song, Anne Murray. This has basically become my Merlin/Arthur theme song, because it gives me all the feels about the two of them being cuddly and gentle and adorable with each other. *hugs*<br />
<br />
If you enjoyed this, please consider leaving kudos or a comment - I'd love to hear what you thought! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
(See the end of the chapter for notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Things are different after that. Sometimes it feels as though Merlin can feel Arthur under his skin, so close, so opposite in nature, but so perfect. As though the tiny seed of each of them lies in the centre of the other's very soul.<br />
<br />
Merlin uses his magic, now, in Arthur's sight; little bits here and there, the lighting of a candle, the warming of a jug of water. The first time, Arthur looks at him with a white face, and then grabs him and pushes him into a chair and lectures him for a long time about being reckless and stupid and endangering himself.<br />
<br />
'Can I not do magic in front of you, then?' Merlin asks quietly, when Arthur pauses for breath; and Arthur groans and closes his eyes and runs his hand through his hair.<br />
<br />
'You're going to turn my hair grey with worrying about you,' he says in a low voice.<br />
<br />
After a moment he reaches out and takes Merlin's shoulder in a warm grasp, giving it little shakes to punctuate his words. 'You can do magic when you're with me, alone, with the door locked. Only then. And I warn you, Merlin, if I hear or see even a hint - a whisper - of reckless behaviour from you, I will make you sorry - you - were - ever - born. Am I understood?'<br />
<br />
His face is implacable. Merlin swallows and meets his eyes. 'I understand,' he says meekly, and Arthur relaxes a little. There's a long moment where they look at each other, and Arthur's hand is still warm and protective on Merlin's shoulder, and Arthur has that deep serious wonderful look again, like he's looking right inside him. And Arthur is moving closer, and his eyes are very tender and his lips are parted-<br />
<br />
And the door rattles, and they leap apart. Merlin's shaking all over, and he twines his fingers together and looks pleadingly at Arthur, who's smiling rather ruefully. 'You look like a startled deer, Merlin,' he says, and touches Merlin's face very briefly with his hand. 'You'd better go for now.'<br />
<br />
Merlin quivers, and goes, peeping back at Arthur when he reaches the door. Arthur's just standing, watching him, his eyes warm and soft, and smiling a very little bit.<br />
<br />
Merlin takes a deep breath, and flees.<br />
<br />
Merlin is innocent, and gentle, and very idiotic, for all his magic.<br />
<br />
Arthur loves him. He has known it since Merlin had looked at him with tear-wet eyes in the forest, his face tipped up to be dried off. Perhaps even before that, when Merlin had slipped from his horse and waited in terror for Arthur's judgement, and Arthur had known that if Merlin were to die, Arthur might as well jump into the flames to join him. Because a life without Merlin in it was unthinkable.<br />
<br />
Arthur is honourable and chivalrous, a knight of Camelot, although perhaps not quite so innocent. Merlin must not be scared, or made to get the wrong idea; Merlin deserves more than to be Arthur's secret in the dark, to be put aside when the next visiting princess or political match arrives in Camelot.<br />
<br />
(When Arthur is King, he can change things, if Merlin wants it. He has a vague idea of marriage, or some sort of equivalent union. He's not sure what precedent there is, but there must be something, and if there's not, he'll make something.)<br />
<br />
Perhaps it had been the wrong time, before. Merlin had been frightened, perhaps; he had certainly been shaking, beneath Arthur's hand. Next time must be better.<br />
<br />
So Arthur plans it all very carefully. He does nothing more than smile at Merlin, and ruffle his hair, the next time he sees him, though Merlin keeps shooting him little wistful glances that make hope rise up high in Arthur's throat.<br />
<br />
But when Merlin's finished his tasks (adorably clumsy and flustered, because Arthur's been watching him) and turns to leave the room, Arthur stands up and stops him with a hand on his arm. Merlin's cheeks are flushed pink and his lips are quivering; it's all Arthur can do to stop himself from kissing him then and there.<br />
<br />
But Merlin is an innocent baby, and deserves for this to be done properly. Arthur caresses his arm, a very little bit, with his thumb. 'Merlin,' he says, 'I wish to go riding in the forest tomorrow. Will you come with me?'<br />
<br />
Merlin looks at him with wide startled blue eyes, because Arthur, it must be admitted, has never really asked Merlin to accompany him anywhere, just ordered it or assumed that he would be there. Arthur holds his eyes with his own, smiling slightly, and Merlin swallows. 'Yes,' he whispers.<br />
<br />
They go riding, and Merlin's so jittery and jumpy that it's a wonder he doesn't spook his horse. Arthur decides not to take them too far, because Merlin looks like he might bolt at any moment.<br />
<br />
'Do you like this?' Arthur asks, and Merlin bites his lip and nods, looking rather as though Arthur has grown an extra head.<br />
<br />
They dismount, and tie up the horses - at least Arthur ties up his horse, and then looks over at Merlin, and Merlin's head is bowed over the straps and he seems to be having trouble. Arthur moves up behind him, and says 'Need some help?' in his ear, and Merlin jumps violently and swings around.<br />
<br />
'No! I mean, no - yes!' he stutters, and then says desperately, 'Why are you acting like this?'<br />
<br />
'Like what?' Arthur asks.<br />
<br />
'Like - like you're under - some sort of spell!' Merlin blurts, and he looks upset and worried, his brow furrowed up and his fingers twisting and pulling in his own hair.<br />
<br />
Ah. Arthur begins to understand. 'Has that happened before?' he asks.<br />
<br />
'Yes!' Merlin says miserably, 'and you're acting weird and too nice and not insulting me or ordering me about - and - and I don't know what to think.'<br />
<br />
'Not ordering you about?' Arthur says lightly. 'Or insulting you? Well, then. Merlin, you suspiciously minded idiot, I'm ordering you to sit down here, right now, and shut up and listen while I talk some sense into your thick skull.' He waits, watching Merlin's face.<br />
<br />
Merlin makes a funny little sound. It might be a sob, but it probably isn't, because he's starting to smile, joyful and relieved, and the smile spreads all the way to his eyes and his adorable ears.<br />
<br />
Arthur ties up his horse for him, shaking his head at the tangle Merlin's made of it all. Then they sit down together on the soft pine-needled patch that Arthur has chosen; and Merlin hugs his knees to his chest and smiles happily at Arthur over the top of them.<br />
<br />
'Now,' Arthur says. 'I suppose you think I'm under a love spell. I assure you that I'm not. My head's clear, there are no gaps in my memories and I still think you're the worst manservant I've ever had. I was merely trying to be nice, but it has become obvious that you're seriously disturbed and enjoy being insulted.'<br />
<br />
Merlin's face is an adorable combination of delighted and confused; he's flushing and looking down at his knees, a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. Then he peeps at Arthur from under his eyelashes, and says softly, 'Prat!'<br />
<br />
Arthur wants to reach for him, so badly. Perhaps Merlin isn't the only one who's seriously disturbed, because Arthur thinks that he rather likes being insulted by Merlin, too. They smile at each other, and then Arthur remembers something, and jumps up, pointing a finger at Merlin. 'Stay there.'<br />
<br />
He's back in half a minute, holding his hand behind his back. 'Part of the reason I chose this spot,' he says, 'was this.'<br />
<br />
Merlin looks at him inquiringly, and Arthur grins and proffers the blue periwinkle he's holding in his hand. 'I want to give you flowers,' he says quietly.<br />
<br />
There's a long pause, and then Merlin - Merlin is pressing his knuckles into his mouth, hard, and blinking rapidly, and sniffing; and Arthur reaches for him.<br />
<br />
And Merlin is scrambling and coming to him as though he belongs there, nestling into Arthur's chest and flinging his arms around his neck. It's like all the other times they've held each other, and yet different, gentler. Waves of tenderness are rolling over Arthur, and Merlin keeps sniffling, and there are tears on his face.<br />
<br />
Arthur cradles Merlin's head, and places the periwinkle at his neck, tucked in the folds of the red scarf. And then - and then, Merlin's face is close, and his lips are soft, so soft; and Arthur leans forward and kisses him.<br />
<br />
It's incredible, and amazing, and worthy of a love song that Arthur has no capability at all to write. Merlin's quivering in his arms, making little contented sobbing noises, and his lips are even softer than Arthur had imagined, and trembling against Arthur's own. Arthur kisses away the doubt, and the worry, and the fear of Merlin's magic being discovered; he kisses away the ache of Merlin's long-kept secrets.<br />
<br />
And he kisses Merlin because he loves him, and he always will love him, and they belong together, like two opposite halves of a whole being. And the kiss is a promise between them.<br />
<br />
'I want you to marry me,' Arthur says. They've just broken the kiss, and Merlin's in a dizzy euphoric daze, half-lying against Arthur's chest, which is warm and comforting and blessedly solid. Arthur's arms are strong and reassuring around him, and Merlin snuggles into them, and Arthur laughs softly. 'You're an innocent little baby, aren't you?' he says.<br />
<br />
Really, that's going too far. Merlin's tongue feels heavy and slow, but he manages to murmur, 'I am not.'<br />
<br />
'Of course you are,' Arthur says firmly. 'Will you marry me?'<br />
<br />
'Is that - even possible?' Merlin asks sleepily, frowning.<br />
<br />
'It will be,' Arthur says, and there's that mulish, implacable look again, the one that says that Arthur will have his sweet way, if he has to turn half the world to fire to do so. 'It will be, when I am King. I promise you, Merlin.' He pauses, and looks into Merlin's eyes. 'You're not going to be my secret in the dark. I'm going to marry you, or nothing.'<br />
<br />
Merlin's heart feels full and light, like it's going to burst out of his chest; and he turns his face into Arthur's neck and rubs his nose softly against the skin there, smelling Arthur's nice warm safe Arthur-smell.<br />
<br />
'I sometimes - sometimes wondered if, if all that honour and chivalry stuff was really true to you knights,' he says, rather unsteadily, into the hollow of Arthur's neck, and feels Arthur bend his head to listen. 'I guess it is. To you.'<br />
<br />
Arthur's hand smoothes up and down his back, gentle. 'It is,' he says firmly.<br />
<br />
They go back to Camelot, and to anyone else's eyes go on as they always have, the Crown Prince and his manservant.<br />
<br />
Except now there are long soft glances between them, and lingering touches that they can't quite hold back when they're in public. And in Arthur's rooms, behind the barred door, there are sometimes long sweet kisses, and sometimes gentle nestling embraces that go on, and on, and on, and give both of them strength to carry on with everything, day after day.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, Arthur falls into a black mood. 'This will drive me out of my mind,' he mumbles into Merlin's neck. 'This hiding. Lying.'<br />
<br />
They're cuddled up in a pile of blankets by the window, watching rain drip coldly off the stone, and Arthur's expression has been tight and drawn all day. Merlin runs gentle sure fingers over his face, smoothing out the wrinkles in Arthur's forehead, running his hands through Arthur's soft hair. 'Shh,' he says, and pulls Arthur in closer to kiss his temple softly. 'Don't be a dollophead.'<br />
<br />
That makes Arthur grin a little bit. 'That's not even a word, Merlin.' He shifts round a bit, disturbing Merlin, who's nuzzling his cheek like a baby deer, and takes Merlin's chin tenderly, and kisses him.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it's Merlin who goes quiet and miserable, and it takes a lot of coaxing from Arthur before he will talk it out with him.<br />
<br />
'Come on,' says Arthur gently, after a dismal morning of council meetings, where Merlin has had to stand quietly behind Arthur's chair and listen to the King outline new plans for the suppression of scattered magic users, and drop veiled hints about 'strategic alliances' with one eye on Arthur.<br />
<br />
'Merlin.' Arthur bolts the door behind them and reaches out; Merlin's stiff and chilled and taut, like a spear of ice. 'Oh, come here.'<br />
<br />
He wraps warm strong arms around Merlin, and for a moment Merlin stays rigid and unbending. The next, he's shuddering and melting and grabbing onto Arthur's shirt as though he wants to burrow into his chest, and Arthur holds him and makes small soothing sounds and rocks him a little to calm him.<br />
<br />
'I'm sorry, so sorry. It won't always be like this,' he murmurs against Merlin's dark hair.<br />
<br />
'I know,' Merlin mumbles into his shoulder, and they hold on to each other for a long quietening moment. And their lips seek each other and meet softly, and everything seems somehow brighter, though the sky is misty grey outside the window.<br />
<br />
Other times, lovely times, they sit together in the sun, and laugh and tease and talk about all the things they'll do, one day, together.<br />
<br />
Arthur finds that Merlin wants children, someday, and also that he blushes most adorably when Arthur brings the subject up. They end up wrestling on the grass over it, which inevitably leads to Arthur pinning Merlin helpless beneath his body while Merlin fires breathless laughing insults at him, the both of them surrounded by a happy haze.<br />
<br />
Merlin, for his part, coaxes out Arthur's dreams of ruling with Merlin as his Consort and Court Warlock at his side, and it takes a little while for him to become accustomed to the thought of such worryingly high rank. 'But Arthur! I've no idea how to act like a - a Consort or anything! And what kind of awful clothes will I have to wear?'<br />
<br />
Arthur's eyes gleam.<br />
<br />
'Oh, no,' Merlin says warningly. 'Oh, no, you don't, you prat.'<br />
<br />
'Oh, yes, I do,' Arthur says in a voice of soft velvet; and he drowns Merlin's objections in another kiss, one that leaves Merlin dizzy and happy and incoherent and quite unable to form any more protests or defy Arthur's authority in any way.<br />
<br />
And so they build their shining dream-castles in the air, for the future and the kingdom they'll make together. King and warlock, sun and moon, night and day - two halves of a whole, complete, connected, in complement.<br />
<br />
And hope is in the very air they breathe, and a promise.<br />
<br />
I hope you all enjoyed! :)<br />

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
'Look,' Merlin says softly. 'You can see where the clouds are going.'<br />
<br />
Arthur squeezes his hand. They're lying on their backs, in the long soft meadow grass, three day's ride from Camelot; and Arthur's heart feels warm and full and light, and Merlin is by his side. And there is a ring on Arthur's hand that was not there before, and a matching pair to it on Merlin's; silver and gold twining and knotting together in complicated twists.<br />
<br />
'The sky's so blue,' Arthur says, and Merlin lets out a little breath of a laugh of pure happiness, and rolls over so he's against Arthur's chest, looking deep into Arthur's face with a smile as blinding as summer sunshine. Arthur bumps his nose gently to Merlin's, and he can't help grinning back at Merlin like a lovesick fool.<br />
<br />
And then they're melting and twining together, body fitted to body, lips moving slowly against each other; and all around them like an embrace are the soft sounds of the grass and the Earth and the trees.<br />
<br />
<br />
Several months earlier<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes, everything just goes wrong. As though the world is conspiring against you or something, trying to knock you off your feet and drag you down. Merlin feels a bit like that, right now.<br />
<br />
The King is pushing Arthur to choose the bride of his choice from three highly eligible princesses and one just-as-eligible widowed noblewoman. He has also been enthusiastically drafting plans to hunt down certain wandering bands of druids that have been sighted in the borderlands, and he's placed Arthur in charge of their extermination.<br />
<br />
Uther holds a large and cheerful session with his council to unveil these new plans, and Merlin stands in the corner and fixes his eyes on Arthur's face, because he thinks he might scream if he looks anywhere else. So he just looks, and looks, and looks at Arthur, at Arthur's strong fierce jawline and proud beautiful nose and kind mouth, while Uther's voice fills up and reverberates around the inside of his head. And every so often Arthur glances at Merlin, and it's like a lifeline between them.<br />
<br />
Finally, finally, it's blessedly over, and Merlin comes to Arthur, and they leave the hall together, and go to Arthur's room. There's no speaking between them, but they're walking so close beside each other that their shoulders are brushing.<br />
<br />
And Arthur pushes the door shut behind them, and bolts it with a fierce thud as though to shut the whole world out; and they turn and look at each other.<br />
<br />
'I don't want a damned bride,' Arthur says in a crackly sort of voice. 'Unless it's you. You wouldn't be a bride, I suppose.'<br />
<br />
'No, you - you'd be the bride,' Merlin says, trying to turn it into a joke, although his laugh breaks a bit at the end.<br />
<br />
Arthur's grin is crooked. 'Not a chance,' he says. And then both of them move at the same moment; and Arthur rests his palms on Merlin's shoulders, and Merlin cradles the back of Arthur's head with one hand, and tugs, so that their foreheads meet and they lean together. The sound of their breathing mingles; and Merlin's free hand comes to rest on Arthur's chest, rubbing little blunt circles over his shirt.<br />
<br />
'I -' Merlin says, and his voice cracks a little, and he clears his throat and tries again. 'I love you.' It comes out quiet, aching, tender.<br />
<br />
Arthur's eyes are closed tightly, and he swallows. 'Me, too,' he says. 'But you, that is - I mean...' He trails off, blushing a little and tongue-tied. Merlin snorts a little, at the dear vulnerable idiocy of him, and it makes a little weary smile tug at the corner of Arthur's lips.<br />
<br />
He tips his head to take Merlin's mouth with his own, and then they're melting together, lips against lips, hands warm as sunshine on each other's backs.<br />
<br />
'I just - ' Arthur says, much later, and stops. 'I just want to go away from everything, sometimes. Just - go, somewhere, where I don't have to be a prince, and no-one wants me to marry anyone I don't love, or hurt innocent people, or anything. You - me - we could run away. Somewhere far away - oh, I know it's stupid, you don't have to tell me that I have my duty to think of, but... But.' He laughs a little bit, self-deprecating.<br />
<br />
They're curled up by the window, in their favourite spot, watching the late-winter rains turn the snow to slush. Merlin snuggles against his side, playing with Arthur's shirt-laces. 'It's your father that tells you things like that, not me, Arthur. And it would be wonderful, why can't we do it?'<br />
<br />
Arthur looks at him. 'What? Merlin, you know we can't just elope. What on earth are you talking about?'<br />
<br />
Merlin's eyes are very bright. It's his thinking look, the one he gets when he's having an idea. His ideas are split rather evenly between brilliant and atrocious, so Arthur fixes him with a wary eye.<br />
<br />
'Go on, spit it out.'<br />
<br />
Merlin leans forward. 'Why can't we elope? No, listen, Arthur, really. I don't mean really run away from everything, but... I've been finding out things, talking to people. The druids - they marry people like - like us. It doesn't matter if it's two men, or two women, it doesn't make any difference to them.' His voice trails, quiet. 'Anyone who wants to, to make... promises. To each other.' He holds Arthur's eyes, a flush rising high on his cheekbones.<br />
<br />
There's a traitorous little stab of excitement in Arthur's chest, and he swallows hard, because there's something big and tight in his throat that feels oddly like hope.<br />
<br />
'I'd - I want that, Merlin,' he says hoarsely. 'I really - I want that, a lot. Do you - would you - with me...?'<br />
<br />
And Merlin's laughing rather unsteadily, and his eyes are brighter than ever, and his lashes are wet. 'Of course I do, you big dollophead. And you - you just had t-to make me cry, didn't you?'<br />
<br />
Arthur thinks that's a little unfair, because he hadn't done anything, really; but he doesn't have time to say that, because Merlin's suddenly turning and flinging his arms fiercely around Arthur's neck, nestling and pressing against him as though he's trying to melt the both of them into one person.<br />
<br />
Arthur holds him tenderly and dear God, he's so lucky, so very impossibly blessed to have Merlin, because Merlin is dear and beautiful and the most precious thing in Arthur's life. And a great crashing billow of feeling surges up inside him, so that he wants to run for miles and fight and dance and bite Merlin softly all over his face, and shout to the world that he loves him, he loves him, he loves him.<br />
<br />
He doesn't say it, of course, can't say it, because he's Arthur and sometimes it's hard to make his words match up with everything that's really inside his heart. But he looks at Merlin, and he thinks that at least some little part of it must be showing on his face, because Merlin's face is open and wondering, looking into Arthur's own as though he sees a revelation.<br />
<br />
'Arthur,' Merlin whispers. 'Oh - Arthur - Arthur.'<br />
<br />
'I love you,' Arthur says awkwardly, and feels himself flushing to hear his voice finally say the words. It sounds so - so pathetic, and ordinary-sounding, and not at all like the beautiful deep feeling of it in the core of himself. It's not like when Merlin says it, either, sweet and heartfelt, his blue eyes intense.<br />
<br />
But Merlin doesn't seem to mind, because he's coming and crushing his mouth against Arthur's, kissing him with tender trembling lips, and of course he's crying because he's an innocent sentimental baby who always cries when he's happy or sad. And Arthur kisses him back, and then licks up his tears with tiny gentle flicks of his tongue along Merlin's cheekbones, because it seems like the right thing to do.<br />
<br />
It takes months. Months of Merlin going off on surreptitious scouting trips to make contact with travelling druid tribes, months of Arthur staying behind and worrying, months of plans and disappointments and excuses and longing.<br />
<br />
'The druids are peaceful,' Merlin says gently. He runs his hands reassuringly up and down Arthur's back, standing behind him as Arthur broods out of the window. Merlin's fingers are long and slender, sure and skilful, and Arthur relaxes into the caress with a little weary sound as Merlin rubs gentle thumbs into the hard tensed bands of muscle in his shoulders.<br />
<br />
'Yes, the druids are peaceful,' Arthur says, his eyes closed, 'but the bandits and raiders aren't. I want to come with you.'<br />
<br />
Merlin sighs and leans forward against Arthur so that his firm chin rests on </td>

<br />
She looked lovely, standing at the balcony, staring out at the city scattered beneath her feet. <br />
<br />
Her brown hair caught in the wind and revealed her pale, bare shoulders, as pale as the hands gripping the railing, and the bare feet peeking out from beneath the sheer white shift she wore.He could see the narrow nip of her waist, the gentle flare of her hips, and her thin tapering legs.<br />
<br />
The wind blew more constantly, and her hair whipped forward, covering her face. <br />
<br />
She didn't move. <br />
<br />
She might be cold.<br />
<br />
He slipped his cloak off his shoulders and approached her, dropping it over her shoulders and gently brushing back the curls obscuring her eyes. <br />
<br />
She still didn't move.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's on your mind?&quot; <br />
<br />
She was silent for several seconds. &quot;Many things.&quot;<br />
<br />
His fingers curled into a slow fist when she failed to say anything else. &quot;Such as?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a longer silence, and he watched her knuckles turn white. Her body began to shake minutely. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was calculating how many seconds it would take me to hit the ground if I jumped off the balcony. How many people are dead because of me. How many will die if I stay alive. And how many you'll kill if I died now,&quot; she finally said in a forced, automatic voice.<br />
<br />
A curdling sensation swept through his gut. His lip curled into a snarl as he gripped her shoulder and forced her to turn and face him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll kill them all if you die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her lovely brown eyes were flat as she looked up at his face and nodded slowly. &quot;That was my conclusion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; he said in clipped voice. <br />
<br />
He let go of her and stalked back inside. <br />
<br />
Once he was alone, he wrenched open a drawer in his closet and pulled out an old photo of her. Her eyes were bright and dancing, and he watched as she wrapped her arms around Potter and Weasley, threw back her head, and laughed. <br />
<br />
He could almost hear it, although she hadn't laughed for years now. <br />
<br />
She feigned it--polite chuckles in response to his jokes or the jokes of his friends. Her eyes always stayed flat. The light in them didn't dance; the corners didn't crinkle. She never gripped her chest or gasped as though she couldn't breathe from it.<br />
<br />
She was never happy.<br />
<br />
Nothing he gave her was ever enough. <br />
<br />
He'd set fire to the world around him, but never let a flame touch her. <br />
<br />
He hadn't calculated that her unbearable sense of empathy meant she'd feel it all anyway. <br />

<br />
All roads lead to Rome. <br />
<br />
Draco had read the line in a book as a child, hadn't had the faintest idea what it meant, and been too nervous to ask his father. <br />
<br />
For as long as he could remember, everyone told him he was smart. His mother. His father. His grandparents. The parents of other children.<br />
<br />
He was Draco Malfoy. He was smart. He was going to break hearts. <br />
<br />
Those were the pillars upon which he built his identity. <br />
<br />
He tried very hard throughout his life to only do things that would ensure people would continue thinking he was smart. He didn't ask questions when he felt like he was probably supposed to know the answer. He didn't try to do things if he wasn't sure if he could succeed at them. <br />
<br />
He cheated--which might have been rather unfair of him, but if he was smart enough to get away with it, didn't that just highlight the point?<br />
<br />
Yet, somehow, life had really not gone nearly as well as he'd hoped. <br />
<br />
For one thing, being Draco Malfoy had become disgraceful. For another, he'd spent his entire formal education at Hogwarts being soundly trounced academically by a Muggle-born. And finally, and most recently, said Muggle-born was was in the process of stomping his heart into pieces.<br />
<br />
All roads might have led to Rome once, but in Draco's life and experience they all led to bushy-haired, bossy-voiced, know-it-all, swot extraordinaire Hermione Granger. <br />
<br />
No matter which choice he made, or which aspect of his identity he had tried to lean into, Granger's irritatingly large eyes somehow appeared in the horizon of his life and proceeded to bowl him over. <br />
<br />
He was never the smart one when she was in the room. Not ever. Not even remotely. Granger just oozed brilliance out of her pores. Any accomplishment Draco had ever managed, Granger had probably done it two or three years prior and without training. <br />
<br />
He was Draco Malfoy and, as Malfoys do, he'd gone and become a Death Eater, thinking that the world would be a much more delightful place if over-accomplished Mudbloods stopped mucking it up for him. <br />
<br />
Somehow that road had also led to Granger: in his drawing room, screaming while his aunt tortured her. As he'd stood frozen in horror, it dawned on him that a world without over-accomplished Mudbloods wasn't a world in which he was any better, it was just a world with a lower ceiling.<br />
<br />
So he'd turned on his heel and walked away from the entire ideology of it. He'd thought a one hundred and eighty degree turn would send him in a direction in which Granger would never cross paths with him again.<br />
<br />
And yet... <br />
<br />
Draco wasn't sure if his world was just that small, or Granger somehow loomed incredibly large, or possibly she did something to disrupt physics or gravity that constantly put her into whatever path he took. <br />
<br />
They'd ended up on the same charity board, which he'd told himself would be fine given that it was a large charity and he was not really an active member aside from writing numerous cheques for them. But then somehow he'd been dragged into hosting a charity gala, which had resulted in his having to plan the said gala with Granger. <br />
<br />
Draco had told himself it was fine as he was dragged rapidly down yet another road involving Granger's extremely large, bright eyes, and thoughtfully pursed lips. He'd swerve at the last moment or perform a Wronski Feint or something, and the road would go around Granger. <br />
<br />
He reminded himself of it the entire evening while he downed glass after glass of champagne, and danced holding her in his arms, and repeatedly drowned in her aggravatingly enormous eyes.<br />
<br />
It was fine, until it wasn't fine any more.<br />
<br />
It turned out, in retrospect, that Draco had drunk too many glasses of champagne while telling himself that it really was going to be the last time he interacted with Granger. As they stood in the empty ballroom, Granger kicked off her shoes and pulled out the pins keeping her hair in place while helping the house-elves clean up. Her eyes kept getting larger and closer, and when she looked up at him and made a joke about the melting ice sculpture, Draco forgot about swerving. <br />
<br />
He kissed her. <br />
<br />
He kissed her and she kissed him back, and they kept kissing and made it all the way up the staircase and down the hall into his room. He'd pulled her dress off and tangled his hands in her bushy hair; drank in the moans that dripped from her clever mouth; and nibbled and nipped and kissed her brilliant skin; and watched her enormous eyes grow dark. <br />
<br />
When he came inside her, and then fell asleep kissing her and holding her in his arms, he decided that maybe all roads were supposed to lead to Granger. Maybe that was the point. <br />
<br />
Except she was gone when he woke the next morning; and he'd been lying in bed for ten hours now, trying to re-evaluate his entire existence once again. <br />
<br />
His road had led to Granger, but now that he'd reached her, she'd gone, gathered her things, and left without a word to anyone, not even the house-elves.<br />
<br />
He took a despairing drag from the cigarette dangling between his fingers.<br />
<br />
Now that there was no doe-eyed Granger on his horizon, he wasn't sure what direction he was supposed to go in. Since the age of eleven there had always been two directions--towards Granger or away from Granger, and they'd always ended up being the same direction in the end. <br />
<br />
Now it felt as though the needle in his compass was left spinning wildly, and he didn't know anymore which direction was towards her or away from her or anything else about the nature of the universe.<br />
<br />
Therefore, he had decided not to get out of bed until he died. <br />
<br />
He theorised that if he smoked and drank aggressively enough he could probably cut his estimated life-span in half, which meant only forty or fifty years of mourning.<br />
<br />
His mother came and tried to force him to come down for lunch and he flatly refused. <br />
<br />
He drank firewhiskey all afternoon and when he was on the verge of passing out or maybe dying from alcohol poisoning, Granger materialised in his bedroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Myyyy god,&quot; he slurred and sat up to glare at her. &quot;How is it my life always ends up fucked by you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She folded her arms and stood glaring at him. <br />
<br />
Draco threw his hands in the air. &quot;It doesn't matter what I do, or don't do. It's always you. Every time I walk away, I always end up coming back to you from a different angle. I can't even peaceably die in my own bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco pressed a hand against his heart and fell back into the pillows. &quot;What have I ever done to you to deserve this--?&quot; He blinked and then said, &quot;Aside from the obvious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Granger still wasn't saying anything, which was fortunate because Draco had a lot to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've ruined my life. Obliterated my identity. I'm never the smartest, and now it's not even impressive to be pure-blooded anymore--and I was getting over it, but--but why? Why did you have to break my heart?&quot;<br />
<br />
He glared at her again, still gripping his wounded chest. <br />
<br />
She sighed and tucked several curls behind her ears. &quot;Draco--I had to catch a portkey this morning. I'm positive I told you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco blinked and stared up at the ceiling. Now that she mentioned it, he did recall her breathily murmuring something about not being able to stay while he was busy kissing along her throat and divesting her of the dress she'd been wearing. <br />
<br />
Something about Sweden. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; he said slowly. &quot;Right.&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
She stood glaring at him with her hands on her hips, drawn up to her fully unintimidating height of barely more than five feet. Her eyes were flashing, and her hair appeared to have begun moving of its own volition. There were small sparks emitting from several particularly angry looking curls. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Being senior undersecretary to the Minister doesn't give you permission to remove an Unspeakable from their department and assign them as a personal bodyguard for your vacation to Santorini. This is a blatant abuse of power, and you will go and tell the Minister that aurors will be a perfectly acceptable security detail&quot;--her voice grew deadly--&quot;unless you want to find out exactly what it is that I do in the Department of Mysteries.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She smacked a piece of parchment down on his desk and turned on her heel. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Draco watched Hermione strut angrily out of his office and the door slam with a resounding bang. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He leaned back with a resigned sigh and eyed the smoldering piece of paper. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Apparently he wouldn't be proposing to her this weekend either. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He twirled his wand in his fingers and stared thoughtfully at the ceiling, trying to think of a new means of prying his witch out of her beloved laboratory for a few days without tipping her off.<br />

Hermione stared down at the milk toast the house-elves had placed before her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Darling--&quot;<br />
<br />
Her husband looked over his newspaper at her, his eyes glittering. &quot;Yes, my light?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was difficult to say whose voice dripped with more saccharine sarcasm. <br />
<br />
Hermione studied him for several seconds in silence before her lips curved into a razor-edged smile and she speared a piece of soggy bread with her fork.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted to say how relieved I am that you aren't being petulant because I said you shouldn't participate in the Quidditch game this weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco folded his paper and laid it aside. His silver hair matched his glittering grey eyes. &quot;Of course not,  Dearest. After all, I am 'old' and 'not nearly as fit as I like to think I am.' It brought to mind that I haven't cared for you in your old age as attentively as I should. Given that you are nearly a year older than I, I realised some proactive measures were in order.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione nodded slowly. &quot;Now that I think about it, my jaw has been bothering me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Concern suddenly flashed in Draco's eyes. <br />
<br />
A thin smile graced Hermione's face. &quot;I think it's probably for the best that I avoid  any  rigorous oral activities for the next several months, don't you?&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
&quot;I said no, and I meant no. Choose a different floor, or I'll change my mind about it completely.&quot;<br />

Hermione nodded and turned primly back to her paperwork. &quot;That's fine. I just don't want it in the dungeons.&quot;<br />

&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;We'll take it,&quot; Granger said promptly, ramming her extremely pointy elbow into his ribs. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We will not,&quot; he muttered as he doubled over and struggled against wheezing. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ignore him.&quot; Granger was smiling brightly at the concierge and handing over a credit card while her stiletto heel drove agonisingly into his foot. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There are other hotels,&quot; he said, trying not to hobble as he chased her down a long hallway. &quot;Hundreds. This city is massive. It's not like this is the only hotel.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, Malfoy,&quot; she said coldly as she reached the door and slotted the hotel key in. The lock beeped and turned green. As she gripped the knob, Draco's hand closed over hers, his heart was pounding heavily in his chest. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Granger--&quot; he said in a weak voice, struggling to find the right words. &quot;I cannot share a bed with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Her eyes narrowed dangerously. &quot;I'm not trekking around an unfamiliar city at one o'clock in the morning to find another hotel. I'm tired. I have had an exceptionally long day putting up with you. I am sleeping here. If you want to go find another hotel on your own, be my guest. Now. Get. Out. Of. My. Way.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blood was roaring his ears as she pushed the door open and stepped in, flicking the switch by the door and kicking her shoes off in the same movement. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She gave a breathy sigh of relief that coiled through his gut and sent a flush of heat across his chest as he followed her into the room and let the door shut behind him. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She peeled off her slick raincoat and hung it in the closet and dropped her bag onto the dresser. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Draco's eyes were locked on the bed. It wasn't the smallest bed, but it looked small when his mind was filled with the thought that it would be Granger lying beside him, close enough to easily reach out towards, and she apparently had no objections whatsoever to such an arrangement. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The collar on his shirt was soaked and felt stifling. He reached up, loosened his tie, and undid the top several buttons.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He allowed his gaze to travel away from the bed back to Granger. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Her hands were sliding up her leg and under the hem of her sheath dress. Draco tried not to choke audibly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Was she unhooking her stocking? Did she wear stockings with a garter belt? He wasn't sure if he had the fortitude to know that particular detail about her. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Draco felt as though he were on the verge of a heart attack as his eyes followed her pale hands as they slid along her inner-thigh. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Morgana...<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Her hands slipped out from under the hem of her dress. Her wand was gripped in her right hand. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She straightened and, with a quick flick, shrank the chair, desk, and mini-fridge. She levitated them up into her hand and then lined them neatly along the top of the dresser. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She waved her wand again and extended the room by an additional ten feet and then proceeded to conjure a second bed complete with duvet and several pillows. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She pivoted on her heel and leveled him with a scathing glare before she added an enormous privacy curtain. <br />

&quot;Potter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Malfoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry pressed a button on the lift and then stepped back, leaning back against the wall and folding his arms loosely as he stared at the pointy-faced prat his best friend had just announced she was dating.<br />
<br />
Malfoy's eyes were locked on the lift doors. His expression was cool and indifferent, but as Harry studied him,  he noticed that the corners of Malfoy's eyes were tense and the fingers of his left hand twitched as though he were fighting the urge to reach for his wand. <br />
<br />
Harry cleared his throat and watched Malfoy's entire body go rigid for a split-second. He started to open his mouth. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Hermione will murder you if you mess with him. <br />
<br />
<br />
He shut his mouth resignedly and wished the lift would hurry up. <br />
<br />
Instead, there was a grinding sound, and the lift abruptly came to a halt. <br />
<br />
Malfoy let out a disbelieving breath and stepped forward, jamming his thumb repeatedly against the buttons. The lift buttons illuminated but nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Malfoy banged against doors and swore under his breath. He tilted his head back and rolled his jaw so that it popped audibly before turning to look at Harry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; was all Malfoy said before leaning back against the opposite wall and loosely folding his arms, mirroring Harry's stance. <br />
<br />
He's got his wand in an arm holster, Harry realised. <br />
<br />
After several deafening minutes of silence Malfoy snorted. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not going to fight you, Potter. If you're going to pummel me in the lift, you'll have to make the first move. Just get it over with.&quot; His teeth were bared, and he had the same nasty sneer on his face that he'd worn at school. <br />
<br />
Harry's eyebrows shot up. &quot;I'm not going to attack you. Hermione will murder me if I mess with her personal life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy didn't relax one bit. &quot;Right,&quot; he said in a tone thick with disbelief. &quot;The lift just happened to break with you and I in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry shrugged. &quot;Well. I've been here the whole time. So--wasn't me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy's eyes rolled briefly, and he turned and stared stonily at the doors. <br />
<br />
The silence dragged until Harry couldn't take any more. <br />
<br />
&quot;How's working in the Wizengamot?&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy's jaw twitched. &quot;We really don't need to talk, Potter.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were several more minutes of silence. <br />
<br />
&quot;So--you and Hermione,&quot; Harry said, stuffing his hands into his pockets and finding a snitch he'd forgotten about. &quot;I can't say I ever expected that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I imagine not.&quot; Malfoy didn't look away from the doors. <br />
<br />
Harry pulled the snitch out of his pocket and started tossing it and catching it. He eyed Malfoy. &quot;You do actually care about her, right? This isn't some plan your dad hatched up to make your family look better by using her, is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy's lip twitched and curled upward. &quot;Yes, Potter, I'm using her, and I'm going to tell you all about it in a Ministry lift, and I chose her because there aren't any less obvious Muggleborns to date.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry's eyes narrowed. &quot;Why not? She was the Muggleborn you always said you hoped would die first. It's hard not to think this is just a different way to hurt her--since it's not  fashionable  to want her dead anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy's jaw twitched and the tension around his eyes got more obvious. &quot;Right&quot;--his voice was stiff--&quot;because if I hurt her, it would assuredly make my family look better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry caught the snitch and gripped it. &quot;It could be either one. Either way Hermione is the one who ends up hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy was silent for a second, and then he turned his head to look at Harry. His grey eyes were shuttered and cold. &quot;So what now? Is this the part where you threaten me with Azkaban or grievous bodily harm? Order me to stay away from Granger or else? Do tell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry stared at him. &quot;Why do you still call her Granger?&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy twitched and looked away. &quot;Habit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you like her?&quot; Harry wasn't trying to come across as though he were interrogating Malfoy, but he couldn't help himself. <br />
<br />
Malfoy wasn't even trying to hide his irritation. &quot;Why do you like her?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry blinked and tried to think of a way to explain Hermione. <br />
<br />
&quot;She's--Hermione,&quot; he finally said. He stuck his chin out. &quot;She's my best friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's why I like her too,&quot; Malfoy said in mocking voice. &quot;Although I could live without the latter point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry glared at Malfoy. &quot;She doesn't seem like your type.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. &quot;My type? And what type is that precisely?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone who can't form a thought on their own.&quot; He raised his eyebrows. &quot;You've always liked the stupid people who'd follow you around and do whatever you told them. You weren't ever friends with anyone you thought was your equal, only people who let you feel like you were better than them.&quot; Harry was no longer trying to hide his dislike. &quot;So--yeah, Hermione doesn't really seem like your type.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy sneered at him. &quot;Difficult as it may be for you to imagine, Potter, some of us are capable of evolving beyond our eleven year old selves.&quot; <br />
<br />
His hands had curled into fists, and he looked as though he were on the verge of trying to deck Harry. &quot;What do you expect me to say? It's not as though it's convenient. Did you think I planned it? I've barely gotten my life back together, and now I've got another thing that everyone's waiting for me to fuck up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy slammed his fist against the doors and stood, radiating rage. <br />
<br />
Harry's mouth twisted and he rolled his eyes. &quot;So why are you publicly dating her then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy's hand slid down the door, and his shoulders slumped. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know how to stay away from her--and I didn't want her to think I was hiding her, that I didn't want to be seen with her. This way--when it goes south, the way everyone expects it to, it'll be my life fucked by it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Harry raised his eyebrows again and tossed the snitch into the air again. &quot;Sounds weirdly noble of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy snorted but he didn't say anything in response. <br />
<br />
Harry leaned his head back against the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hermione goes all in on things,&quot; he said after a minute. &quot;She never bails, no matter how bad things get or what it costs her. She doesn't care whether anyone will appreciate it. She always does what she thinks is right. If she thinks someone needs her, she doesn't know how to say no to them.&quot; His chest tightened. &quot;I--I took advantage of that a lot--in school. I was so focused on what was happening to me that I never bothered to see how much I was asking from her without even noticing. Especially during the war.&quot; <br />
<br />
Harry gripped the snitch in his fist until the bones in his palm hurt. &quot;I don't want to see that happen to her again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy nodded slowly, still staring intently as the doors. &quot;Let me know--if she's hurting because of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry was tempted to retort that if Malfoy hurt Hermione, Harry wouldn't be letting him know as a favour, but he bit his tongue. Malfoy sounded half-despairing. <br />
<br />
The lift suddenly jerked, descended a few more feet, and the doors slid smoothly open.<br />
<br />
Malfoy glanced at Harry out of the corner of his eye before straightening and walking rapidly out without a backwards glance. <br />
<br />
Harry followed him slowly and watched him enter the Magical Creatures Department. <br />
<br />
Hermione was standing by a receptionist desk with an enormous armful of scrolls and an overstuffed satchel hanging heavily from her shoulder. There was an anxious expression on her face as she spoke rapidly to the receptionist. <br />
<br />
Malfoy's walk slowed to a saunter. &quot;I hope you aren't bringing all of that with you to lunch,&quot; he drawled. <br />
<br />
Hermione looked over. Her expression cleared and her eyes lit up. &quot;Draco--I got caught in meetings and thought I might have missed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy slid her bag off her shoulder and up onto his own and started taking all the scrolls. &quot;Lift got jammed on the way down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione's eyebrows furrowed. &quot;That's odd. They're levitational, they shouldn't be able to get stuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Charmwork may be old. Did you still want to check out the new cafe in Diagon, or were you in the mood for something else?&quot; <br />
<br />
They were heading back towards the lifts, and Harry stepped back to avoid several elderly witches returning from lunch. <br />
<br />
Hermione and Malfoy passed him without a glance and entered the lift. As the doors slid shut, Harry watched her slip her hand into Malfoy's and lean her head against his shoulder. The tense, defensive expression on Malfoy's face had disappeared. As he stared down at the top of Hermione's head, his face appeared unguarded for the first time in years. Then the doors shut entirely, and the couple disappeared from view.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did it work?&quot; <br />
<br />
Harry looked over as Ron appeared. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trapping Malfoy in the lift with you. Jennings in maintenance owed me a favour. When I saw you get on, I legged it down the stairs. Figured half an hour was long enough for you to tell him to fuck off and leave Hermione alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry rolled his eyes. &quot;You think I was going to hex him in a Ministry lift?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ron shrugged cheerfully. &quot;Or throttle him. That's what I'd do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry shook his head. &quot;Hermione could castrate me ten different ways if I messed with her boyfriend. If he's not afraid to date her, I doubt there's much I can threaten him with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ron was eyeing him with disgust. &quot;You didn't do a thing, did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry stuffed his hands into his pockets and stared at the closed doors of the lift. &quot;I really didn't need to. She's got him whipped.&quot;<br />

&quot;What are you---umph!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He hummed against her lips as he backed her across the room and against the wall. His hands slid down and gathered her skirts up around her hips, his fingers skimming along her bare skin.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
His other hand dug into her hair, pulling apart the carefully pinned curls and destroying the delicate, sparkling netting that had made her chignon shimmer mesmerisingly. He tugged her head back and pulled away from her lips in order to trail his mouth along her temple, pressing light kisses across her cheekbones, brushing off the carefully applied fairy wings which had made her look ethereal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What's--?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He silenced her again with his mouth. His tongue slipped between her lips as he pinned her more firmly against the wall. His fingers pressing between her legs until he felt her shudder as a soft moan escaped her. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He drew his lips back and nuzzled his nose against hers, pressing their foreheads together as he stroked lightly between her legs. Her hips bucked into his touch.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
His fingers untangled from her hair. He pulled at her neckline until the fabric tore away and left her pale shoulder bare. He dipped his head and bit down on the curve of her shoulder until she gave a breathy whimper. He removed his teeth and traced his tongue over the reddening mark to soothe it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you...&quot; he whispered huskily as his fingers captured the edge of her knickers. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She gave a quiet moan but then suddenly stiffened. She stayed frozen for a moment before slapping his hand sharply away. &quot;You--dragged me away from a conversation with the Supreme Mugwump just because you wanted to have sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Draco blinked. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When she put it like that, it sounded unreasonable. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well--you see--&quot; he started.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She shoved him violently away and stared down at herself in horror before looking back up at him. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You are unbelievable.&quot; Her voice was shaking with indignation. &quot;You have mocked me for months, saying that I don't have a strategic bone in my body; that if I understood a thing about politics I'd know that the real decisions aren't made in meetings.&quot; Her eyes were beginning to glow. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You said if I wanted the bill passed that this--this--!&quot; She was nearly spitting. &quot;This party was what I needed to attend! You dolled me up to look like some vapid fairy, had me buy a dress that cost more than three months rent for my flat, and forced me to spend five hours in a very busy day having my hair and makeup done! And then you dragged me away and ruined it all in less than twenty minutes--while I was in the middle of a conversation with the Supreme Mugwump--because you wanted to have sex?!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
She was nearly shrieking with outrage. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Draco reached up and loosened his cravat, trying to calm her with the very compelling explanation he had. &quot;There were people looking at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She stared at him. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Inappropriately,&quot; he added, in order to help her further understand the context. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She looked as though she were on the verge of strangling him. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He cleared his throat and steepled his hands, pressing the fingertips firmly together. &quot;I think you're right. You should let your hard work speak for itself. These kinds of events are for people who aren't willing to do things by their own effort.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She threw both stilettos heels at his head before stalking across the room onto the veranda and apparating with a deafening boom.<br />

Prompt: Draco not understanding muggle customs (including holiday specific ones)Rating: TCategory: FluffWarnings: None.<br />
<br />
Draco stared in confusion as Hermione abruptly stood up from their table at the cafe and turned around slowly. Her eyes were narrowed as they scanned the surrounding area.<br />
<br />
His hand reached surreptitiously for his wand as he tried to determine what had set her off. There didn't seem to be anything suspicious that he could see.<br />
<br />
<br />
The old woman counting change? Was the pigeon nearby demonstrating unusual amounts of intelligence? Were there any beetles with unusual markings?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
His heartbeat quickened and he started to stand.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hermione's face broke into a relieved smile and she scurried over to a--flower box?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She leaned over and rapped her knuckles on it twice before straightening and returning to their table and continuing to eat as though nothing had happened.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Draco stared at her for several seconds before he finally spoke. &quot;What were you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She looked up and blinked slowly as she finished chewing her salad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Draco's eyebrows furrowed. &quot;When you jumped up and went and hit the flower box.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Understanding dawned in her eyes. &quot;I was knocking on wood so I wouldn't jinx us.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Draco stared at her in bafflement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She waved her hand dismissively. &quot;It's a Muggle thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Draco raised an eyebrow. &quot;Jinxing yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
She shrugged a shoulder as she speared a piece of chicken. &quot;I said we'd still be dating in a year and could visit your mother's palazzo then. In order to keep from tempting fate there's an old Muggle apotropaic tradition of knocking on wood.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Draco quirked an eyebrow and snorted. &quot;You don't even believe in Divination, a formally recognised field of magic, but you stood up in the middle of lunch in order to go tap on a flower box. And now you expect that will keep us from breaking up?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hermione slowly raised an eyebrow of her own. &quot;Would you rather I hadn't?&quot; she asked in a pointed tone of voice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Draco straightened. &quot;No! No. I didn't say that. In fact,&quot; he threw his napkin onto the table, &quot;now that I think about it, I should go knock on it too.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Prompt: When did you know?&quot; &quot;When did I know what, Mudblood?&quot; &quot;That you were in love with me?&quot; Or Hermione's plan to humiliate Malfoy -- and get some justifiable payback for the years of torment -- backfires when her taunts work a little too well and convince said ferret that he just might be in love with her. Genre: surprise meRating: TCategory: Crack, humour. Warnings: None.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
There was a frantic shuffling and slamming of closing books and then Hermione dove under the table and pulled Harry's cloak of invisibility over herself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A moment later, Malfoy came nonchalantly around the corner and then froze. His ferret-y face screwed up with disappointment as he stared at Harry and Ron.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There was a pretentious bouquet of orchids in his hands, with a flock of tiny golden birds flying around it, softly chirping a love ballad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Potter. Weasley. Zabini said he saw Granger studying here.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Harry and Ron stared at each other and then back at Malfoy with confusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Bathroom,&quot; Ron said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ancient Runes,&quot; Harry said at the same time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They both winced and glared at each other.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Malfoy sneered. &quot;She has Ancient Runes on Tuesday afternoons with Hufflepuff, Potter.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Harry nodded awkwardly wondering how Malfoy knew that. &quot;Oh right. I have no idea where she is. You could try the prefects bath.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Malfoy's cheeks flushed bright pink and a slight choking sound escaped his throat.</td>

It's my small fanfiction homage to some of my favorites: Oscar Wilde, P.G. Wodehouse, Jerome K. Jerome, and especially Connie Willis' time travel comedy To Say Nothing of the Dog.<br />
<br />
I hope you enjoy. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know you've got frosting at the corner of your mouth, Malfoy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco Malfoy looked deliberately at Hermione Granger, standing on the opposite side of the lift, and stuffed his gob with the final, massive bite of the chocolate frosted donut pinched with aristocratic decorum between his fingers. Without taking his eyes off her, he chewed and swallowed. Then he swiped his thumb at the corner of his mouth, slid the tip between his lips, and sucked.<br />
<br />
When he pulled his thumb out of his mouth, it made an audible, wet pop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better now?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the worst.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We all have our appetites, Granger. Can't help if mine are a little naughty. What did you have for breakfast? Overnight oats with chia seeds, seasonal fruit and a splash of unsweetened vanilla almond milk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I prefer soya,&quot; said Hermione before she could stop herself, and then, quietly, &quot;Damn it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lift slid smoothly down to Level Nine of the Ministry, and disgorged them both into the quiet of the corridor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have your weekend all planned out, then?&quot; asked Draco. &quot;Perhaps some yoga, a bit of gratitude journaling, take your cat for a walk?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione refused to give him the satisfaction of rolling her eyes. It was Friday, and he'd burned through her last nerve on Wednesday.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a perfectly lovely weekend lined up, thank you for asking. Do you plan to enjoy your usual debauches at the Manor? Does everyone involved sign a confidentiality agreement, or are they free to share what goes on behind closed doors? I imagine things can get a little  sticky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, an air-tight non-disclosure, always.&quot; Draco opened the door leading to the Department of Mysteries and held it for her, the corner of his mouth tugging up in the earliest stages of a smirk. &quot;Although sadly, all of that may be coming to an end. You'll have to hold your breath for juicy details from some other quarter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione entered the round foyer of the Department. The formerly unmarked doors once revolved at random around the entry room's circular walls. They now stood still, and were flanked by neat brass plates displaying titles such as  Magico-Neurology,  Affective Studies,  and  Thanatology. She drew her wand from the pocket of her fitted, cropped trousers, and held it against one of the door knobs until a small light just above it flashed green.<br />
<br />
&quot;God this place is pedestrian since you lot Muggle-ized everything.&quot; He poked a finger at the brass plate reading  Temporospatial Research and Development.<br />
<br />
&quot;Government transparency is something of an adjustment, I realize.&quot; She swung the door open, and he followed her through. &quot;Things like oversight and broadly agreed upon rules for the use of human test subjects may be indispensable to the ethical expansion of human knowledge, but I see how you might find them tiresome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do. I like this style you're experimenting with, though.&quot; He watched her remove her jacket. &quot;The trousers, the loose, tucked--that's a t-shirt, correct? Like a refined tee? Very laid-back, California woman-entrepreneur getting down to business, if anyone actually conducts business in California. You look centered, empowered, and ready for a midday mojito. I'm waiting for the imminent arrival of golden highlights and beachy waves.&quot; He sucked at the opening in the lid of a paper take-away coffee cup and winced. &quot;Why is this coffee such  absolute  shite?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your capacity for complaint is positively supernatural,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;I keep telling you, if you wait until we get into the office, I'll do a proper brew. The witch at the tea cart thinks coffee is a Muggle conspiracy and prepares it accordingly. And stop reading my fashion magazines.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm addicted now,&quot; he drawled in his oval aristocratic tones, &quot;to your hateful beans, and to  Who Wore It Best?&quot; He flung the leather satchel he'd been carrying, embossed in black-on-black with the initials of a highly exclusive Wizarding fashion house, onto a weathered desk at the left side of the room. Then he set down his coffee cup, removed his outer set of robes, and hung them from a peg by the door.<br />
<br />
When he turned around, Hermione was staring at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing. Only you look like an MI6 agent about to motor about Rome on a Vespa in search of a decent cappuccino. Do you mean for your trousers to be that tight, or have war reparations made sufficient fabric an unaffordable luxury for the Malfoys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco looked down at his suit, a close-fitted, matte-black affair in fine-grained wool.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's called tailoring. I understand that fit is an unfamiliar concept when one is accustomed to over-sized cardigans and blouses from the high street cut at nothing but right angles.&quot; He lifted his chin and regarded her. &quot;Do you realize that I heard you use the term 'sweater paws' when you were muttering to yourself the other day? And what's a Vespa? Some kind of Muggle street-cleaning equipment? Would I look good on one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Hermione slammed her own plain olive-drab canvas bag down on a matching desk on the room's opposite side before turning back to him. &quot;You wouldn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I'll find something else to ride.&quot; He lifted an eyebrow at her.<br />
<br />
Hermione breathed out in irritation as she made her way to a table centered in the room supporting a complicated-looking machine, and began fussing with a row of knobs.<br />
<br />
The apparatus consisted of a series of brass tubes and gleaming glass lenses, and mounted in its center was a small hour-glass filled with subtly shifting, luminescent sand. Interlocking brass rings circled the hour-glass, which began rotating slowly when Hermione tapped them with her wand. Below it a wide, highly polished lens hung directly over a round basin filled with a still, dark liquid.<br />
<br />
Draco opened his satchel, pulled out a metal object, and brought it to the table.<br />
<br />
Hermione stopped twisting an etched brass dial.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean, 'All of that may be coming to an end'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you suddenly taking a legitimate interest in what I get up to during my after-office hours?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
He set the metal object at the end of the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not in the least bit interested in what you do with your--oh, good God.&quot; Hermione stared. &quot;I thought you said it was shaped like a swan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco looked at the object.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That has never looked like a swan in its entire life. How could you  possibly...&quot; She trailed off and shook her head as if to clear it. &quot;If anything--and this is being extraordinarily generous--it looks like a recently deceased badger.&quot;<br />
<br />
The object under scrutiny was a small silver-metal box, roughly the size of a woman's fist. Two hinges connected the top and bottom pieces on one side, and a perfunctory clasp held it closed on the opposite. There was, one would have been forced to concede, a certain quality of extreme repose in the figure. It may have been dead or merely sleeping, but the essential fact was that it had come to its place of rest. Whether it was a badger, a swan, or some intermediate species heretofore undiscovered, was open to lively debate. What must have been agreed upon, in light of the evidence, was that it was loosely in the shape of an acorn lying on its side, with a pert triangular tip at its wide end like a little tail, and a series of lumpy, improvisational protrusions at its narrow end. It was delicately etched over its entire surface with what might have been feathers, and might have been thick strands of fur, the grooves having oxidized to black and setting the fine, ambiguous work of the craftsman in sharp relief. There was a pair of what were clearly goggling round eyes--a triumphant exemplar of the artist's ability to wordlessly convey meaning--and the stately open chambers of a pair of ears or, perhaps, nostrils, depending on which part of the figure was supposed to be the head.<br />
<br />
It smelled like stale cigars.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This treasured object has been in the possession of the Wiltshire Malfoys for at least eight generations,&quot; said Draco, frowning, with no small degree of hauteur. &quot;Every single one of them has referred to it as the cursed, swan-shaped snuff box. It is an avant-garde objet d'art, and has been sitting on a shelf in the large drawing room at Malfoy Manor for two hundred years. Forgive me if I defer to the expertise of its faithful stewards over a caffeine-peddling, Muggle-minded swot like yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't know you felt so strongly about the cursed metallic mustelids you keep lying about the place,&quot; she answered, &quot;but if that's a swan, I'm a harpy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing to say to that which isn't going to end in my losing something of great anatomical value to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione looked at him with disdain. &quot;Will you just help me adjust the focus on the Potentiograph? It's gone soft.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has it? It looks fine to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It has. I can see it plain as day. Get your hand over the glass and help me fix it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco moved close to a raised glass square at the machine's far end, and tapped it with his wand. It was suddenly illuminated from below with a diffuse, bright white light. It projected upward into a long run of glass lenses mounted in tubes and interspersed with angled mirrors, ending at the Time Turner suspended over the basin. He placed his hand over the glass, and looked at Hermione.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione peered down at the reflective surface of the liquid in the basin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; she said in genuine surprise. &quot;That's unusual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh  my. Say that again. I'd like to file it away for later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut it and come and look.&quot; She motioned for him to trade places with her.<br />
<br />
He did.<br />
<br />
She stuck her hand over the glass where his had just been. &quot;What do you see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your hand. It's forty five minutes into the future of your fingernails, and you haven't stopped biting them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what else? Look at the background, not the hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Well that's interesting, isn't it?&quot; His brow furrowed. &quot;Is that...it looks like mud, maybe? Rather deep, at that. Merlin, you're actually grabbing a handful of it, how pastoral of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure I will have a perfectly good reason,&quot; she said pointedly. &quot;Minus the mud pies, I saw the same when you put your hand on the platform. Interesting, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop the Turner then start it again and see what happens. It may just be acting up. We've certainly seen stranger things,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Draco brought out his wand, tapped it to halt the Time Turner at the heart of the machine, then restarted it again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What now?&quot; asked Hermione.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your hand is in the lab. You're making me a coffee.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione offered him a personally crafted expressionless stare.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems like just a bit of potentiality leakage. Nothing we haven't seen before in one form or another. No playing about in a field of muck for us today, unfortunately.&quot; He reached over and tweaked the focusing dial. &quot;Focus is dialed in. Shall we have a look at the cursed snuff box?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione looked uncertain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have your emergency jump kit on you?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Draco looked anywhere but at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin, Malfoy, you cannot be serious. I've told you a thousand times at least. They need to be on you at all times: Time Turner, age-stabilizer potion. Both, at  all  times.&quot; She pulled a heavy leather pouch out of her trouser pocket and shook it at him. &quot;Honestly, I'd report you to Shacklebolt if it wasn't your own self-interested, toff backside you're putting on the line by not having your safeguards in place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Having that kit in my pocket ruins the lines of the suit.&quot; He laid a hand protectively across the waistband of his trousers. &quot;And I need a well-fitting suit to lure unsuspecting witches to my depraved orgies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione snorted. &quot;No witch in the entire Ministry could possibly be unsuspecting at this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true. Every witch on the premises is perfectly informed about what I get up to at the weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to bring this lab down with you?&quot; Hermione asked. &quot;You're welcome to live out the rest of your days as a peat cutter in the year 1386 if that suits your fancy, but I'd much prefer to stay here and continue our work. We've only had two full years with our Time Turners. If you'll recall, they took us three rather frustrating years to re-develop in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I was there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what can be done with the spelled restraints placed on them, let alone what's possible if we can demonstrate that it's safe to take them off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; said Draco. &quot;I'll put the potion in my pocket, but there's no need for us both to carry an emergency Time Turner. If we get in a spot of trouble, we'll use yours.&quot; He pulled a vial of shimmering puce-colored potion out of his desk drawer, and shoved it in his pocket.<br />
<br />
Hermione caved to temptation and enjoyed a deeply satisfying roll of her eyes, then slid over to make one final adjustment to the focus dial.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Go ahead and put the badger on the projection plate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco looked at her meaningfully, placed the awful ornamental snuff box on the illuminated glass square, and came to stand beside her, looking into the basin.<br />
<br />
Nothing happened for a long moment, and then the surface of the liquid flashed an alarming neon yellow. The apparatus shook slightly, and the Time Turner made a sort of grinding noise, and seemed to reverse itself. It made a high-pitched squeal, a metallic  ping, then came to a complete stop and went dark.<br />
<br />
Hermione realized after a long moment of silence that in her alarm, she'd dug her fingers into the expertly tailored sleeve of Draco's suit jacket. She looked up at him and unhooked herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn't anything we've seen before.&quot; He brushed off his sleeve and looked at the Potentiograph as though it was about to start frenetically spouting live kittens like popping corn leaping from the machine at the fair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand.&quot; Glaring at the machine, she pointed her wand at the Time Turner and gave it a resounding tap. It remained dark and motionless. Next, she leaned in and gave it an irritated plink with her index finger. &quot;What the blasted,  withering--damn  it! How many Curse-breakings have we looked at ahead of time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hundreds.&quot;<br />
<br />
She counted off on her fingers. &quot;Exsanguination, instant death, boils on the bollocks--every known family of curse has crossed this wretched thing. We've given the Curse-breakers foreknowledge about scores of objects by now, and none of them has ever  broken  the bloody  machine. I honestly can't think of what could possibly be so awful that it's just decided to pack it in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose it's best to set it aside and let the Curse-breakers know. Are you keen to make me that coffee yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sod off, Malfoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione was incensed. Not only was the machine apparently broken, but they'd failed, and failure made her  itch. When she itched, she needed to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm firing up the Dislocator. We can pick up where we left off on Tuesday with the apples.&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco shrugged. &quot;Alright. We'll put the recalcitrant machine in a time out so it can think about what it's done.&quot; He picked up his now cold coffee, took a drink, and set the cup down on the corner of the Potentiograph table. Then he turned to a wooden bench that spanned the entire rear wall.<br />
<br />
A machine sat on the bench's left end. It was built along similar lines to the Potentiograph, only it was much smaller, and instead of a basin and lenses, it stood on brass legs over an empty wooden platform.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm driving today,&quot; said Draco.<br />
<br />
Hermione indulged herself in another luxurious eye roll, and moved to retrieve a shiny brass stopwatch from her desk. With a wave of her wand, a parchment roll rose into the air and bobbed along beside her, with a quill hovering at the ready over its surface. She took a position at the opposite end of the bench to Draco, in front of a slightly raised wooden surface identical to the one under the Dislocator machine.<br />
<br />
A bowl of apples with hazy, speckled yellow and blush-pink skins sat next to the machine. After Draco tapped his wand against the Time Turner at the heart of the device, he used a pair of tongs to carefully slide an apple along the wooden platform below it. When it reached the center, it seemed to wink out of existence with a soft pop.<br />
<br />
Draco plucked a particularly large apple from the bowl and looked at it philosophically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think eating time-shifted apples is going to do me any harm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One can only hope,&quot; Hermione muttered.<br />
<br />
He took a laggard bite while the machine continued to hum cheerfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to worry,&quot; he said once he'd chewed and swallowed. &quot;We'll get the Potentiograph up and running again in the afternoon, and take a look at something particularly good. There's a cursed pair of Italian loafers in the storage closet that I'd like to wear to the Ministry Winter Solstice party, and the more information we can have about them before I put them on my feet the better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione's lips twitched in irritation. She kept a keen watch on the empty platform in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've certainly had worse days,&quot; said Draco. &quot;Everyone's going home with all of their personal bits and bobs in place today.&quot; He made steady work of his apple, pulled a seed from the core, then flicked it, hard, across the wooden platform under the Dislocator, where it disappeared mid-flight.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you mean, before? About putting an end to your single life.&quot; Hermione narrowed her eyes, still refusing to look at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't believe I used those exact words,&quot; he said carefully. &quot;In any case, it's nothing  you  need to worry about, I'm sure.&quot; He fidgeted with the perfect knot of his elegant tie before bending down and slinging a second apple seed into the machine at an upward angle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I  am  worried about it, because you've brought it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now you can forget it.&quot; He sounded terse, even for him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
The second hand of Hermione's stopwatch twitched audibly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's only that you live for your swinging bachelorhood,&quot; she mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who ever actually said that I'm putting on sex parties at Malfoy Manor?&quot; There was a laugh threaded through his words, but his voice was sharp with agitation. &quot;Does that even seem plausible to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems plausible enough, yes. With the...&quot; she gestured up and down at him, &quot;...suits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My  suits, Granger?&quot;<br />
<br />
An apple appeared on the platform in front of Hermione, perfectly round and unbruised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Four minutes, thirty-seven seconds.&quot; She clicked the button at the top of the stopwatch, and the quill took note.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aging?&quot;<br />
<br />
She picked up a brass tube with a cut crystal set in one end, like a kaleidoscope, and looked through it at the apple. &quot;Fifty...two seconds.&quot;<br />
<br />
The quill scratched dutifully away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Markedly so.&quot; She moved the apple to a bin on the floor and consulted the figures on the parchment.<br />
<br />
An apple seed came flying across the platform next to Hermione and hit her squarely in the arm.<br />
<br />
Thirty seconds later, another one came zinging through the air at a steep upward angle, and hit her in the chin.<br />
<br />
She spoke without looking up form her work. &quot;You're such a spoilt child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you're a bloody-minded know-it-all.&quot; Draco wrestled with another budding smirk. &quot;And thus we remain as we have ever been.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without any warning, a new apple appeared on the platform next to Hermione.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've sent one back,&quot; said Draco.<br />
<br />
Hermione directed the quill to note the time in a different column on the parchment, then picked up the new apple, and repeated the procedure with the brass tube.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven point two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco adjusted a series of knobs on the Dislocator, then they repeated the forwarding experiment with another apple, which aged at a slightly slower rate than the first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall we do back, now?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco tapped the Time Turner in the Dislocator with his wand, and it came to a stop. He adjusted the knobs again, then tapped the Time Turner a second time, and it began to whir in the opposite direction. He picked up an apple with the tongs, and pushed it across the platform.<br />
<br />
It disappeared just as the other two had before it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Hermione looked at her stopwatch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Six minutes.&quot; She tapped her fingertip against her bottom lip. &quot;That's a...point zero two rate of de-aging.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent.&quot;<br />
<br />
A brass knob came flying across the platform next to Hermione and hit her in the hip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow!&quot; she cried out. &quot;God, that actually hurt.&quot; She rubbed where it had struck. &quot;I've put up with your damned apple seeds, but that's solid brass. How hard must you have thrown that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea. I haven't done it yet.&quot; He looked troubled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll need to explain yourself in about six minutes.&quot; She scowled. &quot;Merlin, that's going to bruise.&quot; As she bent over at the waist to pick up the knob, a brass screw flew across the platform and whizzed through the air directly over her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hermione.&quot; Draco stared with evident concern at Hermione's end of the bench. &quot;Move away from the destination platform, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione complied with his request without offering him any argument. The moment she stepped away, a shower of shattered brass and glass fragments flew out of the air above the destination platform and through the space where Hermione had recently stood.<br />
<br />
As both she and Draco gawked wordlessly at the detritus now covering the floor, an empty paper coffee cup with a hole burned through the bottom shot into the room from above the platform, landed on the floor, and lolled back and forth in a lazy, ever-diminishing arc, until finally it lay still and peaceful, calmly smoking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I refuse to believe I've chucked all of  that  into the Dislocation field,&quot; said Draco.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a lot, even for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione frowned. &quot;I don't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I liked it better when you said that before. Now it's just disconcerting.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both looked around the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suspect,&quot; said Draco, &quot;that we now have about five minutes left before we need to get out of the room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione nodded gravely.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to think. What's out of the ordinary?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
They both looked around.<br />
<br />
&quot;The box,&quot; said Draco. &quot;We've left it on the Potentiograph lens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. But the Potentiograph is totally dark.&quot; Hermione waved a hand in frustration. &quot;It shouldn't be able to do anything. I suppose we move the box anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco inched toward the swan-shaped snuff box. As his fingers began to close around it, he let out a loud shout, and jerked his hand back as though he'd been burned.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's zapped me,&quot; he said, shaking his fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zapped you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what I said.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione grabbed the tongs sitting beside the Dislocator, and went to grab the snuff box with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steady on, Hermione, I'm not sure that's a good--&quot;<br />
<br />
The moment the tongs touched the box's irregular surface, a glowing jet of what looked like chartreuse lightning shot out of the box and nipped at her fingertips.<br />
<br />
Hermione shrieked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Zapped is fair. No grabbing,&quot; she concluded. &quot;Spell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure adding magic is a solid plan, here. I think we're better off putting a containment spell around the table, so we can localize the damage. We've run the scenarios, your Arithmancy is solid. There's nothing these machines can do under any circumstances that will impact more than the immediate area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione looked devastated.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if it doesn't work? We'll lose all of it, Draco. Everything we've done over the last five years--gone. They'll shut it all down, over that blasted...badger!&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco let her taxonomic error slide, and seemed to consider their options.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. I'm going to try to summon it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if you you're right, though?&quot; She saw that even in these circumstances he couldn't stop the beginning of another smirk from sprouting on his face before he squashed it down. &quot;We have  no  idea what adding additional magic directly into this situation will do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any better ideas?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione hesitated.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but it doesn't follow that--&quot;<br />
<br />
Before she could finish, Draco pointed his wand at the swan-badger feigning innocence on the Potentiograph platform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Accio  snuff box.&quot;<br />
<br />
What happened next seemed to unfold in slow motion. Given the nature of the department it happened in, it may well have.<br />
<br />
When the spell hit the snuff box, the lemon-lime neon light that had merely licked in warning at their fingers before exploded from the box in a fan of crackling stripes, the tip of each one snapping at either the Time Turner at the heart of the Potentiograph, or Draco and Hermione themselves.<br />
<br />
When two of them struck Hermione in the chest and arm, it felt as though twin holes were being bored straight through her, sending vibrating shocks of pain radiating out to the tips of her fingers and down through the soles of her feet.<br />
<br />
She watched as Draco's moon-pale hair stood on end, and then lit up as though it were made up of the fragile white-hot filaments of a thousand incandescent Muggle light bulbs.<br />
<br />
Hermione felt pinned into place by the shock of the curse, and the movements she made toward Draco were as slow and deliberate as wading through freshly poured concrete. <br />
<br />
When the jagged yellow tongues of the curse's energy hit the Time Turner in the Potentiograph, it sparked to life and began to spin, at first slowly, and then with increasing speed, until they could hear its brass rings slicing through the air in a high-pitched, oscillating whine that beat in nausea-inducing waves against the shores of their ear drums.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on,&quot; shouted Hermione, finding Draco's fingertips with her own. Wrenching his hand into a firmer grip, she pulled herself toward him, and finally wrapped her arms ferociously around his torso.<br />
<br />
The door was a mere ten feet away. If they moved then, together, they could press against the enormous, crushing pressure building up in the room, and make it there. Each of the laboratories in the Department of Mysteries was warded and spelled beyond comprehension against spreading impacts from any of the projects going on behind the closed and still-mysterious doors.<br />
<br />
If they could get out, the explosion--because quite clearly there was about to be an explosion--would happen, and then they could go back in and assess the damage.<br />
<br />
Ten feet, now nine...<br />
<br />
Hermione's arms clenched viciously around Draco, whose arms were wrapped around her shoulders, tight and possessive. They moved like that, pulling, pushing, and dragging one another through what felt like the lightless lead weight at the bottom of the ocean.<br />
<br />
Eight...<br />
<br />
Seven...<br />
<br />
When Draco and Hermione were six feet from the door, the snuff box disappeared with a theatrical burst of noise, like it wanted nothing more from life than everyone's complete attention.<br />
<br />
The Potentiograph exploded.<br />
<br />
There was a penetrating rain of brass shrapnel and shards of hot glass. The viewing basin launched itself into the air, held on to its sticky black liquid contents through pure centripetal good fortune as it sailed through the burning brass all around it, then overturned itself and evacuated all over Draco's desk and his expensive designer satchel.<br />
<br />
Had they still been in the room, Draco and Hermione would have been shot through with shattered metal traveling through the air at a murderous clip.<br />
<br />
It was perhaps for the best that they'd popped out of existence just behind the snuff box.<br />
<br />
After the noise was all over, there was a courteous silence while the table that had housed the Potentiograph lightly steamed, as though waiting for a round of applause that never came.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It was black.<br />
<br />
Following close on the heels of the black, which was boundlessly, poignantly devoid of all light, there entered into the experience, without warning, a searing green-white-blue strobing stellar explosion that seemed to come from behind the eyeballs and a bit to the left. Next it went black again, and then color wasn't important, because everything was encompassed by a world-bending dizziness and the feeling of being rotated in two directions at once, top to bottom.<br />
<br />
Next was the mud.<br />
<br />
Hermione opened her eyes, or perhaps her eyes could see after a time where they couldn't. Semantic details retreated into negligibility in the void.<br />
<br />
The sky was a cheerfully ignorant dome overhead, forget-me-not blue and dotted with round idiotic poofs of cloud that would have smiled in smug satisfaction with themselves if only they'd known how to do it.<br />
<br />
The mud.<br />
<br />
The mud.<br />
<br />
The mud reeked.<br />
<br />
It was thick, glorping, heavy stuff, nearly black, and rolling away from Hermione in deep grooves like waves on the surface a solid pitch-dark ocean that smelled like horse manure.<br />
<br />
She heard groaning a short distance away, and sat up.<br />
<br />
Draco was already sitting vertically, facing away from Hermione, his legs spread in an ungentlemanlike V, and shaking his head abruptly from side to side as though he had water trapped in his ear.<br />
<br />
Hermione felt her heart jump up and sprint at the realization that they were, beyond probability,  alive, and in whatever this was, together, sprawled about eight feet apart in the middle of what appeared to be roughly an acre of recently tilled farmland.<br />
<br />
Judging by the pornographic squelch made by her left foot, it had recently been raining.<br />
<br />
They were  alive.<br />
<br />
They were together.<br />
<br />
Both of them, under a blue sky, sitting in a field that smelled like horse shit.<br />
<br />
Hermione almost howled with relief.<br />
<br />
Draco swiveled around to look at her, and there was no masking the look of irrepressible gladness that crossed his face, before it gave way to a shrewd and watchful wariness.<br />
<br />
His hair had for several years been trimmed into an undercut, the length at the top forever flopping about over one eyebrow or the other with a maddening look of thoughtless, casual perfection. It was allowed to adopt a tousled nonchalance that made one think &quot;Bed,&quot; in a way that caused the loins to wobble a bit, and the void hadn't done it any harm. He was sitting in a field of mud, and yet somehow managed to look shaken and wan in a consumptive, poetical sort of way rather than in a disassembled and muck-smirched way like Hermione was sure she must have done.<br />
<br />
Against the black mud, his paleness shone, and his silver-grey eyes reflected the limitless blue of the sky.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Hermione almost felt something like positive regard toward him. <br />
<br />
Then, like an idiot, he smiled.<br />
<br />
That smile.<br />
<br />
The audacity of that preposterous, galling, brilliant,  disrespectful  smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sod,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;You reckless, self-important, pompous prat. You blew...up...my...lab!&quot; She had started at a piano, worked her way through a rapid crescendo and ended in a feral fortissimo.<br />
<br />
His face dropped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your  lab? What do you mean  your  lab?&quot; he argued, fatally.<br />
<br />
She rose to her knees, then bent down to scoop up a generous handful of that midnight-black, rain-soaked, fecund, yielding, horse shit-smelling mud, and chucked it straight into Draco Malfoy's beautiful, pale, vainglorious,  idiot  face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Malfoy,&quot; said Hermione.<br />
<br />
Draco said nothing, only continued to walk across the middle of the plowed field, swiping at his face with the cloth he'd conjured after he'd already used a cleaning spell three times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Malfoy,&quot; she said again.<br />
<br />
He didn't so much as twitch a muscle in her direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Malfoy,&quot; she continued, loudly, prodding in the mud with the bare toes of her left foot. &quot;Wait up, my shoe's come off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To hell with your shoe, and to hell with you,&quot; said Draco without turning around.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're behaving rather sensitively for someone whose home decor has just run us both through the spin cycle of spacetime.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pointed her wand in the area where she believed her shoe had been absorbed by the mud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Accio  shoe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something shifted within the muck four feet away, then with a drawn-out, flatulent sucking sound, a soil-encased object shaped something like an elongated flatbread reached escape velocity, flew out of the ground, and slapped Hermione wetly in the chest.<br />
<br />
Perched on one leg, she wobbled, tipped, then completely unbalanced and fell hard onto her backside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bollocks!&quot; she shouted as she went down. <br />
<br />
At that, Draco finally looked back at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't feel very nice, does it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're expecting an apology, you're going to be very disappointed.&quot; Hermione hauled herself to her feet, mud-filled left shoe in hand, and hobbled after Draco along the length of a furrow, leaving squelching indents as she went.<br />
<br />
&quot;An apology, from Hermione Granger?&quot; he marveled. &quot;The prospect beggars the ima</td>

<br />
<br />
Some children are afraid of the dark. They hide under the covers at night, relaying on their favorite cuddly to protect them. They have nightlights to cut through the darkness. They shake and shiver when things go bump in the night. They run for the protection of their parent's bed after nightmares.<br />
<br />
But other children welcome the dark. For them, it means safety and protection. It means they can stay hidden just that much longer. It means crawling into small dark places only they can fit into. It means they can hide from the monsters that haunt their daylight, not the nighttime. The nightmares hurt them when they are awake, not asleep.<br />
<br />
These children have a reason to love the night, not fear it. For the night brings their protector. The shadow that haunts other children's nightmares embraces them. It wraps them in strong arms and gives them the affection they are otherwise never given. It soothes those wounds it can. It feeds the hungry. It gives gifts to the neglected. It protects the helpless.<br />
<br />
It loves them when no one else will.<br />
<br />
For these children the shadow, the dark man with the golden eyes, is not someone to fear. No. He is someone to look forward to. He is someone to trust and to rely on. He is someone who will always be there for them. He may not always be able to save them, but he will never abandon them. If they do leave this world, they will leave it knowing one person cared for them.<br />
<br />
For he hears the cries of the helpless. He feels the fears of those small souls that should be cherished instead. He knows how cruel the world can be. He wields his powers for the good of the young, though few see it that way. Fear is a necessary part of life. Not the most pleasant part of course, but a required on. Just like yin and yang, light cannot exist without dark. Not everyone remembers this.<br />
<br />
But these children do. They live their lives in darkness. For some, he is the only thing standing in between them and a painful death. For others he is a reminder that love does exist. That someone does care.<br />
<br />
Pitch Black, to those small abused and unloved children, is someone to believe in. For he protects all of his children with the fierceness of a mother dragon.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
There is a house in Surrey, Little Whinging, on 4 Privet Drive. It is a normal looking house, just like the rest on the street. There is nothing about this house to make it stand out. A perfectly ordinary house with a perfectly ordinary household.<br />
<br />
Or at least that's what the inhabitants want you to think.<br />
<br />
There is nothing in this house that would point out that one of Pitch's children live here. But, in a small dark cupboard under the stairs, one does. A small child with a big destiny, if only he can come out on the other side alright.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
The small boy jerks his eyes open with a gasp. He had that nightmare again. The one with the screaming and cackling and the green light. He can never understand what is happening, but he knows it is bad. He pulls the thin sheet around his skinny shoulders. He really hates that nightmare.<br />
<br />
As he sits up, keeping the sheet tightly wrapped around him, he notices something in the corner of his cupboard. Someone. A pair of golden eyes stare at him intently. He covers his mouth to muffle a surprised gasp that escapes him. He must be quiet. Aunty and Uncle don't like it when he's loud.<br />
<br />
Once the shock wears off he stares at the eyes staring at him. He thinks he should be afraid of them. Dudley certainly would. But they aren't doing anything scary. And they don't look mean. He knows what mean eyes look like. He is well versed at reading them. But these ones aren't.<br />
<br />
Looking closer, squinting really hard, he gets a vague impression of a face. A hooked nose on a dark face and black spiky hair. Slowly he waves a hand at it - him - her? The eyes blink at him and move. A man seems to melt right into existence right before his eyes. He sits cross legged in front of the small boy, still looking intently at him. The man looks like he is made of shadows, with his dark features and dark robe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello little one,&quot; he greets in a deep soothing voice.<br />
<br />
The boy offers another small wave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having a nightmare, were you?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I could see that. Such a brave little boy, handling his nightmares so well. Not all children are able to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
He knows what the shadow man means. His cousin never kept quiet about a nightmare. But why was he being praised for it? It was one of the rules - don't make noise. He had never been praised for following the rules by his Aunty and Uncle. And they are the ones who made them. But brave? The man isn't right about that. He isn't brave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might I have the name of such a brave child?&quot; he asks in the same tone of voice.<br />
<br />
He shakes his head. &quot;N' bwave,&quot; he whispers very, very quietly.<br />
<br />
The shadow man has to lean into hear him. &quot;Let me be the judge of that. For now, what is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fweak,&quot; he whispers, as quietly as before.<br />
<br />
A look passes over the man's face, too quick for the boy to understand. But then he shakes his head. &quot;No child, you're name is not Freak. No child's name is Freak. That is a cruel lie told to you by cruel people. No, if they will not give you a name, I shall give you one instead. Would you like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
He thinks about it. His name isn't Freak? But that's what his Uncle always calls him. Or boy. But he knows boy can't be a name. That means he is nameless. But this strange man will name him instead. So the boy nods eagerly. A name of his very own? He's never had something of his very own before.<br />
<br />
The man gives a soft chuckle at the boy's enthusiasm. &quot;Alright then.&quot; He stares at the boy some more, clearly thinking &quot;Leonardo,&quot; he then declares after a few moments, &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy - Leonardo - nods happily. He has a name now! An actual name. And it's all because of the shadow man. He feels tears gather in his eyes, but he wipes them away. That's another rule - no crying.<br />
<br />
But when the man notices, he doesn't scold or yell at him. He opens his arms instead. Leonardo is in them in an instant. This is the first hug he can ever remember having. His arms are strong and tight and he feels so safe in them. &quot;My brave little lion,&quot; the man mutters.<br />
<br />
Leonardo buries his head under the man's neck and holds on tight, never wanting this to end. &quot;Well Leonardo, it is a pleasure to meet your acquaintance. My name is Pitch Black.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nods, bumping into Pitch's jaw as he does.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know why I am here?&quot;<br />
<br />
He shakes his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am the Boogeyman. Does that bother you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Boogeyman? The monster Dudley says will eat him one day? It can't be. This man isn't even scary. &quot;Nice,&quot; he declares firmly into a clothed shoulder.<br />
<br />
Pitch chuckles. &quot;I am glad you think so. Not many do. But I am not here to scare you. I am here to help. You're relatives do not treat you well, am I correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leonardo freezes. That's two rules - no one can know - and - he is a Freak and Freaks deserve what they get. He shakes, afraid now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, little one. It is alright. I am here to help you. I know they do not love you. I can feel your fear. I will protect you for you are one of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
He makes a small questioning noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I protect all my children - the ones who need me. And you need someone to care for you, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leonardo nods hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well. I will provide for you. Understand I cannot stop everything. But I will do everything in my power to protect you. Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes. Every bit of help is welcome, anything to help.<br />
<br />
&quot;The next time I come, I will have warmer blankets and food. Those are things you need correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
Food and blankets. And a name. Leonardo is afraid this is a dream. This is too good to be true.<br />
<br />
&quot;No my little lion, this is very much real. Before I leave, there is one more thing I will leave you with.&quot; He takes one of his hands away from Leonardo's back and urges the boy back. &quot;Here,&quot; he slips a black bracelet around a too thin wrist.<br />
<br />
It is a simple black woven band, but Leonardo can't tell what material it is made of. He touches it cautiously. It is soft to the touch. His first gift.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a bracelet all my children wear. It is made of my sand and serves two purposes. It lets me know if you are ever in dire danger and it identifies you to my other children. They are the only ones who will be able to see it. Do not worry about damaging it, it is nigh indestructible.&quot; He gently pushes the boy off his lap. &quot;I must go now. Other children need me as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leonardo nods, sad, but understanding. He wants him to stay, but he can't be like Dudley. He has to share. He goes back to his thin mattress and lays down. Pitch tucks the sheet around his shoulders. &quot;Sleep well, my brave little lion.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then he is gone, leaving only a bracelet behind as proof he was ever there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pwease come back soon,&quot; the small boy begs before sleep takes him again.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
And that is how the small boy at 4 Privet Drive became one of Pitch's children.<br />
<br />
Life changed for him after that. It was a little bit brighter. He now had warm blankets to wrap up in. He had food in his stomach, even when his Aunt and Uncle didn't feed him. Harry Hunting decreased and then stopped after a series of vicious nightmares. He has someone to hug him at night and tell him bedtime stories.<br />
<br />
It may not be perfect. His clothes are still too big on him. He still has no friends. He still has too many chores and no praise to go with them. He is still an unwanted burden. Everyone still thinks he is a stupid troublemaker. Pitch may not be able to spend as much time with him as Leonardo may want.<br />
<br />
But despite all of that, he has someone who loves him. And that is more then he has ever known.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
Years passed and the boy grew. Not as much as other children his age, but he no longer looked like a starving kitten. He learned. Not that it was obvious. He knew better than to bring back better grades then his cousin. But Pitch taught him so many different things.<br />
<br />
The most important lesson, though, wasn't something he could learn in a book. Strange things tended to happen around Leonardo. Odd things that no one could explain. Things that, when his Aunt and Uncle heard about, made them extra angry that day. Like the one time his teacher's hair turned blue. Or the time he ended up on the school roof when he was running from the bullies.<br />
<br />
When he finally admitted to Pitch what he could do, he did not get the answer he expected. He feared that although Pitch told him he would never abandon him, that he would. He would realize that he really was a Freak and not worth the effort. Instead he learned he was a wizard. He found out that magic was real.<br />
<br />
He wasn't a Freak at all. He was magic.<br />
<br />
Pitch told him about the Magical Community. He told him about the school he would attend when he was eleven. He told him of the strange and the wonderful and the dangerous things he would see. Leonardo loved learning about it. Bedtime stories were now all about the world he belonged to and would one day enter.<br />
<br />
He was so happy. Pitch told him magic didn't make him a Freak. It made him special. Too bad neither of them realized just how special he was.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
Leonardo's eleventh birthday came and went and it took much more effort than it should have for him to read his letter. It took a week and a lot of traveling and a friendly Giant, but he finally had it. The Giant - Hagrid - took him to get his supplies. Diagon Alley was amazing to the boy. This was his first taste of true magic and he loved it.<br />
<br />
What he didn't love was the way people stared at him. When Hagrid told Leonardo he was the Boy-Who-Lived, he was shocked. Of course he knew the story. Pitch had told him about Lord Voldemort and the Wizarding War. Pitch wasn't one to tip toe around dark subjects. It was hard enough remembering to respond to the name Harry. No one called him that. Not his relatives. Not the teachers at school. No one. Now he has to put up with this too?<br />
<br />
He didn't love the clear bias Hagrid had against Slytherin, claiming they were all dark wizards. Dark does not mean evil. Look at Pitch after all. And just because this Lord Voldy came from Slytherin, doesn't mean every Slytherin followed him surely. That just isn't logical.<br />
<br />
He wasn't too thrilled with the blonde boy he met in the robe shop either. He reminded Leonardo of his cousin in some ways. He thought he was a bit too prattish. He was clearly a Pure Blood and Pitch said they tended to be snobbish in some way or another. Not all, of course. Pitch hated generalizations. But there was a common theme. So he decided to give the boy the benefit of the doubt. Not that he told him who he was of course.<br />
<br />
So overall, magic seemed wonderful to Leonardo. The World where it came from... that was yet to be decided.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
Getting Sorted into Slytherin was as much of a relief as it was unnerving. He knew this is where he belonged. He had assumed this was the House he would end up in after Pitch explained the four Houses to him. Too bad the rest of the school disagrees with him. All of the Gryffindors seem to have taken it as a personal offense against them. Which is stupid. The red haired boy he met on the train - Ron - won't even look at him any more. Although his twin brothers still seem to like him.<br />
<br />
The Hufflepuffs - and he still doesn't know what in the world a Hufflepuff is suppose to be, although the same could said for Gryffindor and Slytherin. Ravenclaw is the only one that makes any sort of sense to Leonardo - and the Ravenclaws alternate between shock and indifference.<br />
<br />
And as for his new House.. well, it is a mixed pile cards indeed. The blonde boy from the shop - Draco Malfoy - is highly offended that he didn't mention he was Harry Potter. Other students followed him, while others were offended they had a Half Blood in their House. Others still ignored the other two groups and welcomed him in.<br />
<br />
It could have developed into a problem, no matter what the Prefects said about House being family if it wasn't, ironically enough, for the Gryffindors. When they decided the should teach the Boy-Who-Lived a lesson in supposed 'House loyalties', they did, but not in the way they were aiming for. Suddenly Leonardo could barely pry Malfoy away from him. He had decided to show the Gryffindors just how Slytherin looked out for its own.<br />
<br />
And Leonardo was right. He was a bit of a prat. But he wasn't completely hopeless either. And with him came the others who followed Malfoy's lead. Eventually he went from tolerating the boy to actually enjoying his company, along with Blaise and Theodore. They even accepted that he wanted to be called Leonardo, even if they didn't understand it.<br />
<br />
And Pitch still visited him when he could. Not as much as before because there were always others who needed him more. But he never abandoned Leonardo, just like he promised. He even told him that he had other children in the school, if only he would look for them. Pitch refused to give names, but Leonardo didn't mind. They had a right to privacy after all. He was certainly relieved when he knew Pitch would never tell anyone he was abused.<br />
<br />
Leonardo had no plans on telling anyone. Ever. He could endure it with Pitch's help. And now he would only be there a few months out of the year. He would be fine. Because no one could ever know. Just look at their reaction to his being Sorted. If the Boy-Who-Lived shouldn't be in Slytherin, then he most certainly shouldn't be abused either. He would never get any peace.<br />
<br />
The most interesting part of his new school, though, was his Head of House - Professor Snape.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
The first time Leonardo saw Professor Snape, he couldn't help but stare. He looked like a pale version of Pitch. The only difference was the hair and the eye color. They both seem to have the same mannerisms and the same way of talking. They certainly had the same way of staring at you. And that eyebrow quirk. They could be twins, almost.<br />
<br />
Professor Snape confused Leonardo. He acted like he had a problem with Leonardo. When he looked at him, it was like he had swallowed a lemon. He treated him just like any other Slytherin, but sometimes it looked like he didn't want to. It looked like he wanted to treat him like a Gryffindor instead. Which would have been bad. Professor Snape did not like Gryffindors. At. All.<br />
<br />
Other times he would just stare at Leonardo like he was looking for something. The boy didn't know what, but he wished the man would find it so he would stop staring at him. It is unnerving. He is use to Pitch's stares, but not Professor Snape's. He can be rather scary when he wants to be.<br />
<br />
Still, Leonardo finds him fair, if a bit too strict at times. He tells them his door was always open to them if they have a problem. He tells them he has a zero tolerance policy for bullying. He tells them to be proud and to stick together. He doesn't lie to them or cuddle them, but he cares for them.<br />
<br />
It reminds Leonardo so much of Pitch it hurts.<br />
<br />
Pitch laughs and laughs when Leonardo tells him this. &quot;Oh my little lion, I have a twin in the school, do I?&quot; He still calls Leonardo a lion, even though he is a snake now. Both of them find it ironic. And funny. Or at least Leonardo likes to giggle over it sometimes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! He acts so much like you. But he doesn't seem to like me very much. I think... I think he might hate me,&quot; he blurts out quickly<br />
<br />
Pitch pulls him into a hug. &quot;Do not fret little one. I am sure he doesn't hate you. Maybe you remind him of someone he disliked long ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean? Do you know him? Is he one of yours too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what have I told you about asking questions like that?&quot; Pitch raises an eyebrow, even if Leonardo can't see it with his head buried in Pitch's shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't,&quot; the boy mutters, &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are curious, I know. But you have to respect other people's privacy as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I do know this Professor of yours. I have been around Hogwarts a long time. I will not say whether he is one of mine or not. But I will say he does not hate you. I know you bring up painful memories for him, for I did have a few encounters with him. There is more going on here than you know. But he does not hate you. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nods again, hesitantly. He wants to believe Pitch, because Pitch never lies to him. But sometimes it's hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Now tell me about this new Charm before I have to depart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's really cool! It changes...&quot;<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
Professor Severus Snape, Potion Master and Head of the House of Slytherin, is many things. Most would describe him as spiteful and vicious and an overall unpleasant person. He wouldn't disagree. But there are other parts to the man that others miss, including his fierce protectiveness and fiercer loyalty to the very few he decides he can trust. To this day, they number three, with two of them being dead.<br />
<br />
The first is his Mother, who tried to protect her son from her husband, even if she never succeeded. His Mother loved him, but she was not strong enough to stand up to Tobias. Not strong enough to do the one thing that would ultimately keep him safe from him - leave. She dies when he was fifteen.<br />
<br />
The next was Lily. She was his first, and only if the truth be known, friend. As children he told her all he knew about the Magical World. When they went to Hogwarts, their friendship stayed intact even when they were sorted into rival Houses. She stood up with him against the bullies, until that last faithful time. She died to protect her son.<br />
<br />
The last... even to the Wizarding World he doesn't exist. He is a figment of children's imagination. A foolish thought indeed. After all, if werewolves and vampires and dragons exist along side magic, why can't he? One would think that the Wizarding World would be more open minded to those sort of things. But no, even they have their fairy tales.<br />
<br />
Severus is simply in a unique position to know not all of them are mere tales - Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman and - the most infamous of the lot and the one the man is loyal to - Pitch Black. The Boogeyman.<br />
<br />
Most people would either scoff at the idea or back away quietly. But to Severus, Pitch represents safety and security and love. He is the reason Severus survived to his majority. He is the reason many children have reached their majority reasonably intact.<br />
<br />
When Severus turned spy - he was never loyal to the Dark Lord, no matter what anyone assumes - and was forced to teach brats Potions, he decided to continue the tradition. He had a Healers license as well as a Mastery in Potions, as the two often went hand and hand. So when he began teaching, he looked for the signs - a child who flinched at everything, one who was too thin, too skittish, too bitter and distrusting, too rebellious and - the most obvious - wore Pitch's band on their wrist.<br />
<br />
The same band he wore on his own wrist. Of course he could have taken it off now. He no longer needed the protection Pitch provided. He was now lethal enough that no one was stupid enough to mess with him. But it calmed the students greatly to see that he understood. He was someone who could be trusted because he was like them. Besides that, as much as he was unlikely ever to admit it, it still offers some form of comfort to know he will never be truly alone.<br />
<br />
So even after the war has ended, when he is still stuck teaching the little dunderheads, he continues. It is soon an open secret among certain circles that Professor Snape is the one to go to for help. He will do everything in his power to keep them safe. That he and Pitch are the best allies they will ever have. He cares like Pitch cares. He is scary like Pitch, too, so no one is dumb enough to try and hurt him. They become Severus' children as well as Pitch's.<br />
<br />
So by time a too small Harry Potter arrives at Hogwarts, Severus has years of experience protecting the children that the shadows embrace.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean that he is perfect though. He never claims to be. Even spies can have blind spots. And anything associated with the names Potter or Black are, unfortunately, two of the man's biggest spots. Even more unfortunately, Harry Potter just happens to be associated with both.<br />
<br />
So when the too small boy is Sorted into his House, he does not bully the boy. But neither does he pay close attention to him. He might even neglect the boy, however slightly he can. Not to be spiteful - even if he is a spiteful man - but because it is painful to look at the boy for long.<br />
<br />
Thus, it takes him much longer than it should to realize the truth.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
It is after winter break that Severus notices it.<br />
<br />
He is having his First Years brew as simple Boil Relief Potion as review after being away from school for those weeks before he introduces a new recipe. It is not for their benefit, but his, that he does this. Giving the little dunderheads a chance to get back into the rhythm of things mean they are less likely to blow up his classroom.<br />
<br />
The Potter boy is working on his own potion beside his godson, who has obviously claimed the boy as his own. It makes Severus inwardly roll his eyes when he thinks on it. Bloody Malfoy's and their bloody possessiveness. It is certainly a trait Draco picked up from his Father. Bloody Lucius.<br />
<br />
Although frankly, he is glad the seemingly rivalry his godson was working towards has been averted. Friendly competitiveness was one things, but the wounded pride of a Malfoy quite another. Something else Draco surely picked up at home. Severus has never been more thankful for Gryffindors in his life - read 'never'. If he had to deal with the fights those two started - or rather, Draco started and dragged Potter into, clearly against the boy's will - for seven years, something would have snapped. Most likely his patience. So he supposes possessiveness is the better option in this scenario.<br />
<br />
Potter brushes his hair out of his eyes - James Potter's head of unruly hair - when he sees it. He physically stops breathing for a moment. It feels like it has been knocked out of him. He blinks and looks again before the boy lowers his arm, not noticing the reaction of his Head of House.<br />
<br />
Severus continues to make his rounds around the room, on the lookout for any lethal mistakes. But his mind is going in the opposite direction that it should. All because of an innocent black bracelet Potter is wearing on his wrist. Severus subtly touches his own. It can't be the same one. It's impossible, he is the Boy-Who-Lived.<br />
<br />
But Severus is well versed in the impossibilities of that situation. It does not matter who it is - not wealth, not blood status, not House. It can happen to anyone. He has helped enough children to know this. It never matters. No group is ever completely safe. Nothing is scared.<br />
<br />
When Longbottom almost melts his cauldron, Severus turns his mind away from that train of thought to ponder at a more convenient time. For now he has a classroom to save.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
That night he stares into the fire and thinks. For the first time, he truly pays attention to the Boy-Who-Lived, even if it is in his memories. For the bracelet is certainly the same one Severus himself wears. There is no mistaking it. Pitch made sure they could not be mistaken for any other. So he thinks.<br />
<br />
He thinks about how very skinny and small the boy is. He ponders his skittishness around crowds and habit of hanging back. He wonders about the way he jumps when addressed. The way he prefers the name 'Leonardo' to 'Harry' or 'Potter'. How he watches his classmates do simple things such as eat and speak before copying them himself. As if he does not know how, so he has to check to make sure he is doing it right. The way he overly apologizes for everything.<br />
<br />
Severus thinks of all of this and more and knows what has to be done.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Potter,&quot; Professor Snape calls out at the end of Potions, &quot;stay after,&quot; he commands. Leonardo nods and sets his bag back down on the ground nervously. What could his Head of House want? He has never taken the time to talk to him before. He has barely even looked at him before. And when he does, they are never very friendly looks. Leonardo knows what Pitch says, but he still can't help but wonder if maybe he is wrong. He doesn't want to think so, because Pitch is never wrong, but the thought has crossed the boy's mind.<br />
<br />
Draco gives him a friendly smile before leaving and Blaise waves. He nods back and fidgets as he waits for his Professor to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come Potter, this is not a conversation for the classroom.&quot; Professor Snape turns and walks out the door.<br />
<br />
Leonardo has to practically run to keep up with the man and his long strides. They walk through the hallways to a Portrait of a snake. The Professors whispers something to it and enters. Leonardo cautiously follows after he thanked the snake. Both the Portrait and his Professor seem surprised, but neither say anything about it.<br />
<br />
As Leonardo looks around, he realizes he must be in the Professor's private quarters. The color scheme is earthy greens and browns and it helps put the boy at ease. The next prominent feature is all the books that line the wall and the large fireplace surrounded by a couch and two chairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit,&quot; Professor Snape orders and Leonardo obeys, curling up in one of the chair.<br />
<br />
The Potion Master takes the other one. For a long moment he simply looks at the boy before letting out a sigh. &quot;This is going to be far from a pleasant conversation, but you are not in trouble. Do you understand Potter? This is not a punishment, no matter what it may seem like at first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leonardo nods, but feels his stomach roll. Whatever he is talking about, it isn't going to be good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me Potter, what is your home life like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leonardo's blood turns cold. No. No, he couldn't be asking about that now could he? Surely not.<br />
<br />
Professor Snape continues to stare at him. &quot;I take it the rumors have not yet reached your ears,&quot; he says more than asks. He then reaches down and pulls his sleeve up, revealing a familiar black bracelet. &quot;May I see yours now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leonardo's breath stops. His eyes widen. He starts to shake. No, no, he can't know. No one can know. He is the Boy-Who-Lived. No one can know. No one. His breath starts back up again, but now it is too fast. Much too fast. He starts to feel light headed. His head is filled with white noise.<br />
<br />
He doesn't notice when the Potion Master stands up and walks over to him. &quot;Drink,&quot; he hears and feels something press against his lips. Automatically he drinks. It makes him feel much better.<br />
<br />
He comes back to himself, huddled in a ball with his Head of House crouched down in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Potter,&quot; he starts.<br />
<br />
Leonardo flinches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leonardo,&quot; he begins again and Leonardo is surprised, even if he shouldn't be. Of course the Professor knows his name, official or not. &quot;You know what this means. I am here to help you. You, Leonardo, not the Boy-Who-Lived, not Harry Potter, but you, just as I have helped others in your situation. Just as I was in your situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I was abused as a child until I reached seventeen. Now I help others reach safety much sooner when I can. Pitch may be the Boogeyman no one can see, but they know I am very much real. Not many are foolish enough to cross me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd help me? You don't...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't what child?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't hate me?&quot; he whispers.<br />
&quot;No I do not. I admit I have not been attentive to you, but that is my failing, not yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pitch said I 'bring up painful memories for you'. Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again, it is not your fault. You are not your parents, no matter how you may look like them. You are your own person. That I had problems with your Father and Godfather should not be a factor in how you are treated, even if it generally is. A situation I am now determined to fix. It is the failing of the adults in your life. Not yours. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leonardo nods and then asks tentatively &quot;...Godfather?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a question for another day. For now the focus is on finding a safe place for you to live. But to take you out, I need your word on what has happened. Will you tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll really help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think I am a man who goes back on his word?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leonardo shakes his head. No he doesn't. The Professor is like Pitch. He may not sugar coat things, but he doesn't lie either. He will help Leonardo. So slowly, softly, Leonardo tells his story.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
Severus keeps his promise. He listens to the boy and collects the evidence and goes straight to the Headmaster in an unholy fury. Dumbledore was in for a long night by time the enraged Potion Master was through with him. His ears rungs for days afterward.<br />
<br />
But Dumbledore is stubborn. And in denial. He sometimes forgets that life is not a chess game. He does not condone abuse, but at times he is blind to the signs. He was a General, practically, in two wars and he forgets that they are now at peace. There is no need to sacrifice anyone for the 'Greater Good'. No need to look at the big picture rather than the small one.<br />
<br />
Dumbledore can be as fiercely protective as Severus, but sometimes he forgets what he needs to protect.<br />
<br />
It takes longer than it should. Even after Severus pulls Minerva into the argument. The old fool is stubborn like that. So very obstinate. He should have been in Slytherin, not Gryffindor, with the way he is acting.<br />
<br />
But finally, finally, a solution is reached. It is not one that Severus thought possible. Not after all of this. Not taking into account who he is, what he is like and what he once was. But it is the solution the old coot pushes for and Minerva agrees for Merlin knows what reason. So does Leonardo, when he is told.<br />
<br />
And so, that is how Harry Potter - the Boy-Who-Lived - becomes Leonardo Snape - son of the most feared Professor at Hogwarts.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Leonardo means brave lion. I couldn't resist... The main story is done, but I have some drabbles planned that I will be adding as another chapter.<br />
<br />
a series of drabbles centering around Leo, Severus and their interactions with Pitch<br />
<br />
has anyone else noticed how abuse is an unspoken theme in this series?<br />
<br />
In which there is another first meeting:<br />
<br />
A small dark haired boy curls up tightly under his bed. There is a loud crash and he wraps his arms more tightly around himself. He is safe under here, he knows. Father cannot reach him here - he is too big and too clumsy right now. He would never make it past his doorway. Why bother when there are other, easier, targets, for him to get to?<br />
<br />
Severus isn't sure which is worse - when Father is clumsy or when he isn't. When he is clumsy, he is loud and angry and violent. But he doesn't have very good aim. And he can't continue for long by time he reaches them. That means much of his anger and violence is taken out in form of yelling - spitting out mean, ugly, hurtful words - and</td>

<br />
Peter swings between a few apartment buildings before flipping in the air towards his intended target. Just before he webs down he hears, &quot;Superhero landing, do the superhero landing!&quot; <br />
<br />
He looks up after (admittedly) killing the 'superhero landing' to find Deadpool doing the slow clap. &quot;Yesss! It never gets old!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you need some new material,&quot; Peter says.<br />
<br />
Deadpool puts his hands on his cheeks, his mask stretching comically wide on his face as he squeals. <br />
<br />
&quot;You've been keeping tabs on me? Aw, Spidey, I didn't even know I was on your radar! I bet those spidey-senses tingle extra special when old 'Pool is around, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter has to bite his lip to keep from grinning; it doesn't matter if Deadpool wouldn't be able to tell, it's the principle of the thing. &quot;What can I say, your reputation precedes you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Deadpool hums and takes out one of his katanas before swinging it, just because he can, probably. &quot;I definitely excel in word of mouth, that's for sure. And other things that involve mouths (no, you're right, too sleazy and too soon). That and everyone has an iPhone these days. I swear, Webs, I miss my old Motorola Razr. You probably think that's some fancy blade or something, don't you baby boy?&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter's totally lost the thread of conversation now, and is pretty sure not all of that was even directed toward him. He'd heard from the Avengers that talking to Deadpool often felt like being in a race you had no business running. <br />
<br />
He's about to interrupt when Deadpool says, &quot;Aaanyway, big fan, love the suit, had it first and all that jazz.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter cocks his head and says, &quot;Pretty sure that's my line.&quot; He's talking about the first part of the sentence and steadfastly ignoring the rest because wrong. &quot;Although not directed at you, of course,&quot; he tacks on, because no. He's definitely not a Deadpool fan and he can't go giving this guy any false hope. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, honey, you're gonna need to accept that we'll be sharing the zingers if we're doing this team-up thing. I mean, we're likely to be voted Most Witty Masked Couple, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not a couple,&quot; Peter frowns, crossing his arms over his chest. He's pretty sure that wasn't the important part of that most-recent ramble but -- well -- it's the only part that made his cheeks heat up, so. Oh, wait. He should've objected to the team-up part. Dammit. He was so failing in this 'don't give any false hope' thing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ye-et,&quot; Deadpool sing songs. &quot;This is a slash fic, baby, we'll get there. Hey, maybe it'll even be one of those 'E' ones, those are the best.I'm not talking about 'E' for effort either, although you know I'd give it my all. Straight up 10's all the way, totally would land the dismount. Which we already know you can do, by that entrance a minute ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter rubs at his temple, sighing. He's not even going to attempt to unpack all that, lest his headache grow even larger. &quot;Look, I just dropped in&quot; -- he ignores Deadpool's delighted giggle at the pun while silently being proud of himself -- &quot;to let you know this city is under my watch and to make sure you wouldn't be killing anyone while you're here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, now why'd you have to go and bring the 'K' word into this? We were having a perfectly lovely meet-cute! I envisioned great things for us, sweetums. You, me, rooftop gardens, the finest Mexican food carts New York has to offer.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry not sorry?&quot; <br />
<br />
Deadpool laughs, delighted. &quot;Oh, Spidey, you see how MFEO we are? We're more than that, we're like BAMF MFEO. It's kismet, baby!&quot;<br />
<br />
When the Avengers had briefed him on Deadpool, they played up the Kills People for Money Has No Real Morals angle and left out the Is Pretty Damn Funny and Charming in a Weird, Terrifying Sort of Way part. Peter stands taller, refusing to get distracted further. He fixes Deadpool with a hard, cold stare that he hopes resonates through the mask. &quot;You kill people for a paycheck, dude. I don't associate myself with those types of BAMFs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Au contraire, my Webbed Wonder, I'd say you can't help but be associated with the baddies. I mean, your Rogues Gallery alone is quite the crowded family portrait. A little weak in my opinion. Doc Ock? Come on, baby, you can do better than that. But I digress, even the lustrous other spider-babe (I'm talkin' bout Black Widow, natch) and her weird Link-like bestie have some shade-eee backstories. Why does no one ever mention that? At least I unalive the people who deserve it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd love to dissect that piece by piece, I really would, but I think I've wasted enough time here. I said my part, okay? If you're going to be hanging around this city again, I expect you to keep out of trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens if I do? Ooooh, better yet, what happens if I don't?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You probably wouldn't like it, you weirdo.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't be so presumptuous, baby boy. As our goddess Rihanna said, stick and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm leaving!&quot; Peter announces loudly, his cheeks burning. He's probably had another occasion where he was more thankful for his mask, but it doesn't feel like it right now. &quot;Just don't make me get the Avengers involved, okay? They can be a bit... much.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Awww, it's all coming together now! You do love me! You're looking outttt for me. Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Goodbye, Deadpool!&quot; Peter yells as he swings off the roof. <br />
<br />
&quot;The name's Wade! Mr. Wilson if you're nasty!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't hold your breath on that, Wade!&quot; Peter calls behind him, webbing along the way he came. <br />
<br />
Behind him he hears a faint girlish scream. &quot;He said our name, did you hear that! Oh, this is so going in our diary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter feels a smile tug at his lips as he swings away through the mild New York City night. This time, he gives into it. <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;How'd it go with Deadpool?&quot; Cap asks him the next day. <br />
<br />
Peter shrugs. &quot;Weird? I dunno why you couldn't just talk to him yourself.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's about you asserting yourself. You've worked with us, what, two years now? Besides, most people consider this your city.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Peter mumbles, still unsure how he feels about that. &quot;Where's he been anyway? I mean, I never met him before, that's kinda weird.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who knows with Deadpool? He's trouble, kid, with a capital T. The quieter he is, the better. But I figured a preemptive warning was best.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Peter replies, not entirely convinced. If the dude had been lying low, why ruffle feathers. It seemed -- unnecessary. But whatever. It's done now, and hopefully Peter doesn't have to think about the guy again. <br />
<br />
Which didn't explain why he was, or why he found himself patrolling the next few nights hoping to catch the sight of red and black leather. <br />
<br />
He isn't exactly expecting Deadpool to find him, when Peter's just taking time to watch the sunrise, a peaceful moment after a relatively quiet night. He's come to really love his city even if it sometimes doesn't love him back. <br />
<br />
Peter's spidey-senses start to tingle while the person is still on the other side of the roof. He's about ready to spin and shoot a web at their chest when he hears, &quot;We gotta stop meeting this way, honey. People will talk. And by people I mean the A-team. And by A-team I mean the Avengers. And by talk I mean judge harshly. With the disapproving eyes. And the crossed arms. And the 'you could do so much better, Spider-Man, what has gotten into you?' talking to.&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter relaxes, and then isn't sure why he does that, because -- well, Deadpool -- but nevertheless he finds himself leaning back on his hands and turning back toward the skyline. &quot;You're the one who found me this time, man, why am I the one who gets the imaginary talking to?&quot; <br />
<br />
Deadpool shrugs. &quot;You're the young innocent in this equation.&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter snorts. &quot;I'm nearly 20. I'm not that innocent.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Britney. Quit playing games with my heart.&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter can't help the smile this time and really, really hopes Deadpool doesn't have some sort of X-ray vision that no one knows about. &quot;I think you're mixing your pop music references.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;S'how I roll, baby. You falling into the Wade Pool yet? Get it? Wade pool? (Shut up, that was a good one).&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter laughs, he can't help it. &quot;Who're you talking to, anyway?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Boxes. Voices. Remnants of good 'ole Weapon X's days and nights of torture. Come on, Spidey, do your Origin Story homework. For shame.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Peter says, swallowing. He's not exactly sure where you go from there. It'd probably be a good time to offer up something about himself but, well, this was Deadpool. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you take this to a pity place, this party of two is gonna become one, you get me? And not in the way the Spice Girls meant. Sadly.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not!&quot; Peter says, indignant. &quot;Also, I love that you're threatening me with leaving. Who says I even want you here?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, baby, you know you can't quit me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter turns to him and gives the most skeptical look he can beneath his mask. &quot;Oh yeah? Watch me!&quot; <br />
<br />
He uses his web shooters to connect a line to the building across the way and swings over to it. He mounts the landing and turns to Deadpool, pumping his fist in triumph. <br />
<br />
Deadpool laughs before wolf-whistling. &quot;I hate to see you go but I love to watch you leave!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You seriously need better material!&quot; Peter calls out to him, hating his treacherous mouth for smiling once again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come back here and I'll do better.&quot; He swears he can hear the leer in Deadpool's voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not on your life, Wade.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He said our name again! Oh, Webs, what you do to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter shakes his head, ducking his chin and smiling even wider. He flips Wade off and then swings off the building. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll bring food next time!&quot; Wade calls after him, and it echoes through the sky. <br />
<br />
Peter hates himself for the thrill that goes through him at the words 'next time.'<br />

<br />
&quot;Has Deadpool even been up to anything?&quot; Peter asks Tony one night at Avengers tower. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not that I've heard of,&quot; Tony replies absently, not looking up from whatever device he was working on this time. Peter was a wannabe inventor himself, but sometimes with Tony it was better not to know. He preferred to hang in the lab with Bruce. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why's he still hanging around then?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Beats me, kid. Hand me that socket, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'M not your lackey,&quot; Peter mumbles. <br />
<br />
Tony laughs. &quot;Either make yourself useful or take your pouting elsewhere.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not pouting,&quot; replies Peter, clearly doing just that. Whatever. He leaves, but only because he was bored as fuck anyway. <br />
<br />
He stops a robbery, returns a dog to its owner, and finds himself in the flatiron district, near where he first met Wade. <br />
<br />
He's drawn toward the sound someone singing Beyonce's 'Baby Boy' (badly), all the while knowing he should just swing in the other direction. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is wrong with you, Parker,&quot; he mutters even while picking up speed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby boy not a day goes by without my fantasy,&quot; Wade finishes as Peter touches down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Peter says, hoping he sounds more unimpressed than he feels. He folds his arms over his chest for good measure. That usually works. <br />
<br />
&quot;You answer to your theme song! Good to know!&quot; Wade holds up a bag. &quot;I've got food, baby. Bit cold waiting for you. This could be avoided if you'd just give me your digits. And I don't mean your fingers. We can work our way up to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Peter blurts, literally face palming. <br />
<br />
Wade laughs in delight and Peter really isn't sure when he became Wade in his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh aren't you just precious. C'mon, Spidey, I've got a blanket and everything.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sure enough, he does. It's got a rainbow unicorn on it but he still has one. And a bottle of wine. Really expensive looking wine. <br />
<br />
&quot;Classier than beer, right? But doesn't really go with the burritos. It was a conundrum, Webs, let me tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter hates how his stomach flips a little. <br />
<br />
<br />
Get it together, Parker, a fucking vintage bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon does not make up for the fact that he probably paid for it with blood money.<br />
<br />
<br />
Peter shakes his head, starts backing away. &quot;I can't do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
He can see as Deadpool's face falls beneath the mask before it returns to normal, his tone betraying nothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Too fast, eh? Should've started out slow with a can of Coke. Share a Coke with &quot;insert your name here&quot;. I'd pick a good one for you. Like Brad. Or Lucas. Hey that was a good movie, Lucas. Sucks about Corey Haim, definitely the superior of the Coreys.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can't keep hanging out with you,&quot; Peter says, ignoring the ramble. &quot;I'm... an Avenger and you're... I gotta go.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's the first time Peter leaves that he isn't accosted with Wade's cheerful voice. There's only dead silence and he hates the pit that forms in stomach. <br />
<br />
This is Deadpool, the Merc with a Mouth, a guy out for nothing except what can benefit his own interests. <br />
<br />
He was told to warn the guy off causing trouble, not become chummy with him. So no more. Peter was going cold turkey. <br />
<br />
__________________________________<br />
<br />
4. <br />
<br />
Cold turkey was easier said than done when you're dealing with a Merc that knows Spider-Man hangs out in Avengers tower sometimes. <br />
<br />
That's how Peter finds one of the common area windows spray-painted with a sad face, a poor drawing of what is probably supposed to be the two of them, and a phone number with the words 'call me maybe' beneath it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something you wanna tell us, Spidey?&quot; Natasha says with a knowing look and God, he really hopes S.H.I.E.L.D. hasn't been surveying his and Wade's rooftop rendezvous. He feels like he absolutely would've heard about it if they had been. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, nothing to tell here, everything is peachy keen,&quot; Peter says in a rush. He scrubs at the window before the Captain can see it, but not before memorizing the number. <br />
<br />
Peter debates and debates and debates some more until he finds himself opening a message and typing out <br />
<br />
<br />
Hey. Give me one reason I should talk to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
The little typing dots appear on his phone automatically. So Wade does have an iPhone. That seems weird after the comment, but whatever. <br />
<br />
<br />
This could be any number of people, including a celeb I'm not allowed to mention for NDA reasons but imma put my money on a certain web head with a great butt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(And I don't mean Black Widow)<br />
<br />
<br />
Peter grins despite himself. If I say &quot;got it in one&quot; I sound conceited don't I? Ah, well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Own that butt, baby, it's a good butt. One might even say the stuff dreams are made of.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ,&quot; Peter mutters, cheeks burning. He hides his face in his pillow for a second before clearing his throat. &quot;Focus, Parker.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Answer the question, deadpool.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Deadpool, that's good. Better than Wade. And now you're talking to yourself, Jesus Christ it must rub off.&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter refuses to voice the double entendre his running monologue clearly calls for, even in his own head. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ah, the question, yes. Would &quot;because I've been drowning in 90s pop ballads since our tragic rooftop departure&quot; suffice?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He won't laugh, he won't laugh. Try again. You don't get points for being a masochist.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ouch. I'll have you know the wind beneath our wings is one of the greatest songs of our time. Although that's actually late 80s but whatever it was still super popular in the 90s. Did you ever know that you're my hero, Spidey?<br />
<br />
<br />
Peter snorts (god dammit) and waits him out. <br />
<br />
<br />
Alright alright. How's &quot;because I haven't even killed anyone since before I got back here&quot; sound?<br />
<br />
<br />
Peter chews on his lip, tamping down the nervous flutter of his pulse . <br />
<br />
<br />
is it the truth?<br />
<br />
<br />
He doesn't know why his heart feels like it's in his throat. Since when does he care what this guy does and doesn't do? He barely knows him. Well. He always cares about people not dying, but still. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sir yes sir but not like I can do much to prove it you sweet cheeks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Peter sighs, dragging a hand through his hair. <br />
<br />
<br />
why are you back in town after so long? A-team figured it was for a job<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He stares at those stupid typing dots like they hold the answers to the universe.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(the very fact that you called them the a-team is why ur my fav spidey) no not a job. Would you believe i was hoping to join that gang? Got a little visit from you before i could ask to apply for a membership card tho<br />
<br />
<br />
Peter blinks, mouth dropping open. He tosses his phone aside, mind reeling. Deadpool. Wanting to join the Avengers. Deadpool. <br />
<br />
Peter doesn't know what to believe anymore. Why should he trust one word that came out of this dude's mouth?<br />
<br />
He turns his phone off and tosses and turns all night. When he checks it the next morning there's a bunch of texts from Wade. <br />
<br />
<br />
wrong answer? Thats what i get for telling the truth huh<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
look i know they wouldn't even look twice at me. Known that since you swung into my life on your chandelier-o-webs, so you can relax spidey you're still the shiny new member<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
we must be really depressed if we're not even making a penis joke<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i'd serenade you with a boombox outside a-team tower if i thought a) u were there b) tin man wouldnt send his bots after me c) you'd actually get the reference<br />
<br />
<br />
That text was sent at 11:40. The next and last one was sent at 2:44am. <br />
<br />
<br />
this is fucking pathetic now but whatever go big or go home. I came for the avengers. I stayed for you. See ya around, spidey.<br />
<br />
<br />
Peter wipes the sleep out of his eyes, heart stuttering in his chest at the last message. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck,&quot; he mouths, texting back before he can think better of it. <br />
<br />
<br />
you dont even know me<br />
<br />
<br />
It takes Wade a while to text him back. Peter tries not to think about why that might be, well aware of Deadpool's healing factor and that he can do self-harm easily without any consequences. Peter really didn't want to be the catalyst of something like that. The thought makes his stomach churn. <br />
<br />
what can I say your reputation precedes you is Wade's reply a few hours later, throwing Peter's own words back at him. <br />
<br />
He thinks about how Cap told him, &quot;It would probably be better coming from you,&quot; when he'd suggested them talking to Deadpool. Peter figured he was just being sent on lackey duty, being the newest and youngest member. Now, he wasn't so sure. <br />
<br />
<br />
our rooftop. 8pm<br />
<br />
<br />
He doesn't need to specify. Wade will know the one.<br />
__________________________________<br />
<br />
This time it's Peter who brings the food. Mexican again, and he really does bring Coke instead of wine, hoping maybe it'll at least get a laugh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is this because you're not 21? You do realize the majority of your ridiculous country still drinks anyway. But whatever I'm Canadian, we do things that make sense over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you from?&quot; Peter asks, pulling a steak burrito out of the bag and handing it to Wade. <br />
<br />
&quot;Regina. A vagina joke is way too easy, baby boy, don't lower yourself to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter's lips quirk. &quot;I'll try to contain myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. And now I'm gonna roll up my mask a bit so look away if the Elephant Man or Freddy Krueger or ET freaked you out. Or like, Brad Pitt in Benjamin Button when he wasn't hot. I think I've covered all the bases.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter rolls his own mask up to his nose and waves a hand between them. &quot;I'm fine, just. Do your thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wade is staring at him, mask still firmly in place. Peter licks his lips self-consciously and then wants to crawl in a hole when he remembers Wade just saw him do that. <br />
<br />
He takes a bite of his burrito, hating the flush building on his cheeks. A flush Wade can see<br />
<br />
&quot;Knock it off,&quot; Peter says. <br />
<br />
He doesn't expect Wade's quiet &quot;sorry.&quot; He anticipated maybe a dozen or so remarks about his mouth, but not this. It's pathetic that he actually feels slightly disappointed. <br />
<br />
Peter wants to look at Wade, tells himself he should seeing as Wade looked at him, but he also doesn't want the dude to be any more uncomfortable than he clearly is. <br />
<br />
They eat in silence, neither talking about the shit from last night even though it feels like an elephant on the rooftop with them. Wade's never been this quiet around him and it's almost unsettling. <br />
<br />
Peter finally lets his eyes wander when he's finishing his second can of Coke. Wade's whole face (from what Peter can see) is covered in scars, right down to his lips. Peter has no idea where the thought &quot;I wonder what they'd feel like to kiss&quot; comes from, and decides he really, really needs to get out more. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're a difficult person to figure out,&quot; Peter says eventually. <br />
<br />
&quot;I've got moves you've never seen,&quot; Wade replies, clearly quoting something. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Well. I don't know what to believe when it comes to you,&quot; Peter admits, wanting to add 'or if any of this flirting is genuine or if that's just your M.O.' but chickening out. &quot;But. Uh. I'm willing to take you at your word that you're turning over a new leaf and I'm wondering if you'd like to join me. On patrol.&quot; <br />
<br />
This time, Peter can see Wade's expression change, his mouth dropping open, and some burrito falling out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gross,&quot; Peter says, throwing a napkin at him. <br />
<br />
Wade laughs, self-deprecatingly. &quot;Now, see, that's what I usually get when the mask comes off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, I'm not a douchebag.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wade pauses, stares down at his hands. Peter wonders how rough they are beneath the gloves. &quot;Nah, you're really not,&quot; he says quietly, almost to himself. Peters never heard him sound so... soft. He wants to curl up inside that voice, let it wash over him. <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, Parker, you are in deep.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, yes, Spidey I'll do a team-up with you. How could I possibly resist? You're practically begging here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not begging. And this is is trial run, okay? If you... what do you call it? 'Unalive' anyone at all or fly off the handle we're through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, baby, it's tearing up my heart when I'm with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal with it, Timberlake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm more of a JC guy myself, actually. How bout you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter swallows, pulse jumping in his throat. It's the perfect opening...<br />
<br />
&quot;So you. You like dudes then?&quot; <br />
<br />
His heart is hammering in his chest but Wade doesn't even miss a beat. &quot;Dudes, chicks, non-binary folk, it's all good for the 'Pool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Peter says, heart still racing. This never gets any easier for him, even if he knows the other person will be cool with it. And telling Wade seems like... a big step. This guy doesn't even know his name. &quot;I...I'm bisexual, so.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well now you're just trying to torment us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter laughs, runs a hand nervously over the back of his neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I take it back. One hundred percent hetero over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhmm. Should've known. Straight boys never have asses that good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up,&quot; Peter says weakly, cheeks burning. <br />
<br />
When he looks up, Wade is watching him. He licks his lips and Peter's eyes track the movement.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden he feels like there isn't enough air in his lungs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you should roll your mask down,&quot; Wade says. Peter's never heard his voice sound that way before. Hoarse. Thick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; he asks, barely breathing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because for once the boxes are in agreement and I can't keep looking at your lips much longer before I listen to them and kiss the shit outta you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter feels a frisson of want shoot up his spine. He could do it first, lean over, see if Wade's lips are as rough as they look, soothe over the scars with his tongue. <br />
<br />
But he still hasn't seen Wade in action. Still isn't positive he's really trying here, no matter what his body is wanting him to do. <br />
<br />
Peter rolls down his mask, reluctantly. He watches as Wade's lips thin out in a line and no, that won't do it. He tells himself he shouldn't do this, but he can't really help himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't kiss on the first date, anyway,&quot; he says, biting his lips on a grin when Wade whips his head around to face him. <br />
<br />
Wade recovers after a beat. &quot;I'd argue this is far from date #1 but whatever you need to tell yourself, sweetums.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter can hear the fake bravado behind it, knows that Wade is as shocked as he just looked. Good. <br />
<br />
They make plans to meet up Saturday night for patrol. Peter knows he should probably be questioning his sanity but he swings away from Wade feeling happier than he has in a while. <br />
<br />
He checks his phone when he gets home to find a bunch of burrito, heart, and kiss lips emojis. <br />
<br />
He sends back a blushing smiley face and wonders what the Avengers would say if they saw this shit. <br />
<br />
____________________________________<br />
<br />
5. <br />
<br />
Peter was no stranger to his own witty repertoire or slightly obnoxious running commentary while out on patrol. It made him feel good, taking down criminals and ensuring their evenings plans would be taking a detour to the police station. Wade, however, takes all of that to new levels. <br />
<br />
His mouth runs a mile a minute. He's loud, annoying, and ridiculous, and Peter finds himself far more amused than he should be. But Wade hasn't tried to kill the convenience store robber or the teens having a knife fight in an alley, so Peter considers it a success thus far. <br />
<br />
That is, until they get to a guy trying to sexually assault a woman. They get there early enough, thankfully, but the woman still has bruising on her wrists and hips and is pretty shaken up. Peter's talking to her to see if she'll press charges when he hears the guy scream. <br />
<br />
He looks over to find him pinned to the wall, with the tip of Wade's katana pressed against his stomach. <br />
<br />
&quot;Give me one fucking reason I shouldn't gut you like a fish.&quot; Wade's voice is cold in a way Peter's never heard it before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Deadpool!&quot; Peter yells, using his best Spider-Man voice. &quot;Let him go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No fucking way, Spidey. Scum like him deserve their own special hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree with you, but you're not the one to send him there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wade spins around to him, still holding the guy up against the wall. &quot;You seriously think the legal system will do anything? Oh Spidey, you're so naive. We don't do something and this guy is just at it again tomorrow, same crime, different victim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's agreed to press charges and it's not one man's job to be judge, jury and executioner. Let him go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deadpool turns back to the guy and Peter holds his breath. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're fucking lucky you didn't run into me alone, buddy,&quot; he whispers, voice deadly before removing the blade and dropping the guy. <br />
<br />
Peter webs him to the wall quickly. Wade's with the woman at the end of the alley, flagging down a cab for her. Peter's heart lurches. <br />
<br />
&quot;People like him...&quot; Wade says when he's joined Peter's side again. He's trailed off, voice strangled in an uncharacteristic way. Peter knows there's a story here and he both does and doesn't want to know. It makes him want to punch things. Instead, he aims his web shooter at the guy's crotch and grins when he cries out in pain. <br />
<br />
Wade laughs beside him and the sound is a welcome relief. &quot;Oh, Spidey, you rebel, you. I'm totally heartseyeing right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C'mon,&quot; Peter says, clapping Wade's shoulder. &quot;Let's get some tacos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Motherfucking heartseyes everywhere.&quot;<br />
________________________<br />
<br />
They eat on a rooftop, and it's shitty Taco Bell but it was the only place still open at 2am. It does the trick anyway and Peter enjoys listening to Wade's breakdown of Mexican food, ranking his favorite to least favorite items and then his favorite to least favorite eateries in the city. <br />
<br />
Peter's pretty sure this counts as a date and halfway through their meal he gets fixated on it and the thought of kissing Wade. <br />
<br />
When they've finished their food, Peter stands to stretch and Wade does the same. He's rolled the mask back down and Peter's done the same. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, not bad for your first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what she said.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter laughs, shaking his head. Nerves course through him, which is ridiculous. <br />
<br />
Wade lets out a girlish squeal. &quot;Superhero team up #1 a success, hi-five!&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter slaps Wade's hand, says &quot;I wouldn't say you're a super--&quot;<br />
<br />
He's words are cut off by Wade continuing &quot;and hug!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hero,&quot; Peter finishes weakly as he's pulled into Wade's arms. <br />
<br />
His face is mashed against Wade's shoulder and he never really realized just how... wide Wade is. His arms are strong around Peter's chest and Peter can't help but bring his own up around Wade's back. <br />
<br />
It feels... right. It's fucked up probably, but he feels safer than he has in a while in the arms of this strange wanna-be-ex-Merc. <br />
<br />
&quot;If I said you had a nice body would you hold it against me?&quot; Wade says, voice pitched way too low against Peter's ear. He suppresses a shiver<br />
<br />
&quot;If that's you upping your material you still lack points for originality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, so I guess if I asked if that was a gun in your pocket or if you're just happy to see me that wouldn't be much better, eh? And inaccurate, I mean. With the no unaliving and everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter giggles. &quot;I wear a cup, you moron.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, this just got awkward, then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter doesn't realize what Wade means until he presses a little closer and feels--oh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, God.<br />
<br />
<br />
He stiffens, and Wade pulls back, enough that Peter can look up at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tacos are very arousing, what can I say.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter gives him skeptical look. &quot;Shut up,&quot; he says, and then with shaky fingers he brings his hands up to Wade's mask. <br />
<br />
Now it's Wade's turn to go stiff. &quot;Spidey--&quot; he says, softly but a warning nonetheless. <br />
<br />
&quot;I won't take it all the way off,&quot; Peter promises and waits for Wade's nod. <br />
<br />
He inches the mask up to the bottom of his nose and drags his fingers along those lips, reveling in the rough, uneven skin. <br />
<br />
&quot;You--&quot; Wade shakes his head, shivering as Peter traces his lips in a circle. &quot;I don't understand your life choices, but I'm selfish enough not to care right now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up and kiss me, Wade.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; Wade breathes against Peter's fingers. Then his hands are pushing up Peter's own mask up to his nose and crushing their lips together.<br />
<br />
Peter gasps into the kiss, his hands tight on Wade's shoulders. He presses up onto his tiptoes so he can get closer, kiss him harder. <br />
<br />
Wade moans into the kiss and when his tongue touches Peter's lips he opens his mouth and lets him inside. <br />
<br />
Wade's lips are chapped and rough but his tongue is wet and soft. The stark contrast is unbearably hot. <br />
<br />
Peter walks them backwards, so Wade's pressed up against the short wall near the door that leads to this apartment's stairwell. <br />
<br />
Wade hits it with a grunt and his gloved hands glide up and down Peter's back. &quot;Are you real?&quot; he gasps, breaking away to suck at the hinge of Peter's jaw. &quot;Multiverses are a thing, trust me. You could definitely be a different Spidey.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm real,&quot; Peter pants, barely recognizing his own voice. He presses harder into Wade, rocks his thigh into Wade's very impressive erection, hot and hard against the spandex of his suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ, baby boy, the things you do to me, you've got no idea,&quot; Wade breathes out, sounding reverent and completely unironic. His hands slide down to Peter's ass, squeezing. <br />
<br />
&quot;You've never even seen my face,&quot; Peter points out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't matter. Crazy about you. Crazy in general but you get me, don't you. God, your ass. Fucking work of art. No I'm not gonna-- fucking shut up--&quot;<br />
<br />
Peters never been so turned on or so confused in all his life. Wade's mouth is still pressing kisses all over the exposed parts of his face and his hands are worshiping Peter's ass like some ancient temple.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are they saying?&quot; Peter asks gently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mm,&quot; Wade moans, dragging down Peter's suit to expose his neck and fastening his mouth to the racing pulse in his neck. Peter gasps at the feel of his tongue. &quot;Whitey wants me to slap your ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, shit,&quot; Peter says, weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yellow says that would disgust you, especially if it's me doing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter pulls back, looks into Wade's eyes or as much as he can like this. He traces the scars on his cheeks. &quot;Yellow should shut the hell up.&quot;<br />
<br />
He surges up again, bringing their mouths together, swallowing Wade's shocked, &quot;Oh, fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
The slap makes his body jerk. It's playful but firm and stupidly sexy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby boy, you blow my mind,&quot; Wade groans as Peter nips along his jaw, the uneven skin strange yet hot beneath his lips.<br />
<br />
Wade slaps his other cheek and then just kneads at his ass, hitching Peter even higher along his thigh. <br />
<br />
&quot;This cup is getting really uncomfortable,&quot; Peter admits after what feels like hours but is probably a few minutes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just keep grinding against me baby, I'll get you there. My hips don't lie.&quot; Wade sounds wrecked and he's been sucking at Peter's neck so hard it's probably covered in hickeys. Peter's never made out this long or intense before, and he never wants to stop. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna make you come,&quot; he finds himself saying, the words shockingly true. <br />
<br />
Wade lets out a long, low groan and fucks up against him harder, faster. &quot;You're gonna be the death of me and I can't die. Jesus fuck baby, wanna make you scream my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter gasps and shudders, feels himself so close to breaking apart. &quot;Peter,&quot; he says. <br />
<br />
Wade laughs breathlessly against his ear. &quot;Okay yeah, not my name but I guess this was too good to be true, eh, sweetums?&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter groans, slapping at Wade's hip. &quot;</td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">&quot;Bruce is in a  mood  today.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words are spoken lightly--accompanied by an eye-roll and a little snort as Jason emerges from the cave. He's dressed in his workout clothes, a small towel wrapped around his shoulders and a sheen of sweat to his skin, like he'd just finished training.<br />
<br />
Tim pauses the game he's been playing on his Switch and gives Jason his full attention. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that drug smuggling case we've been working on? That shit with the mob that was finally gonna take down Carmine Falcone?&quot; <br />
<br />
Tim nods, because duh.  That case has been the Waynes' main source of dinner table conversation for the last three weeks. Batman finally tracked their operation headquarters down to an abandoned meat locker in the warehouse district, and he and Robin had received a tip from a reliable source that Falcone himself would be making an appearance that evening to settle a score with another big name in the crime industry. <br />
<br />
(The whole thing is honestly  thrilling; Tim's had to work to keep from bouncing in his seat with every update. If he plays his cards right, Agent A might even let him sit up with him tonight on the comms.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Gordon just called while we were down there. The Feds swooped in and did a bust on the place about twenty minutes ago,&quot; Jason says with a bitter huff. &quot;Recovered a shit-ton of Drops and arrested like,  seven  low-level thugs, but there's no way any of them are gonna be dumb enough to narc. Falcone's totally gonna walk.  Again.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tim feels like a balloon that someone's just stuck a pin through. &quot;Oh man...&quot; he breathes out, imagining all those weeks of hard work down the drain. &quot;That's horrible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it sucks,&quot; Jason agrees, wiping his sweaty brow with the end of his towel. &quot;Anyway, B's taking it hard. He's probably gonna spend the rest of the afternoon sulking in the cave and making sweet love to his favorite punching bag.&quot; He says this with a snort, like it's some kind of joke or something, but Tim barely registers the words over the sudden ringing in his ears.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Bruce is in a mood. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tim has been around his parents enough times after business deals gone wrong or travel plans falling through at the last minute to understand the gravity of that statement. When adults are 'in a mood' it's anything goes. Tim's been sent outside or banished to his bedroom for infractions as minor as playing the TV a couple notches too loud or spilling his Froot Loops on the kitchen floor. His parents aren't really the type to yell at him--not unless Tim  really  fucks up (like that time he'd accidentally broken their antique Pruvian vase and Jack shouted himself hoarse, then blamed Tim for the next two days for giving him a sore throat)--but they're definitely not above making scathing remarks about his manners, or his grades or his appearance, or his overall work ethic. The worst is the stuff they say under their breath--the barely audible murmurs of 'why'd I have kids again?' and 'to think they said this one was supposed to be  smart...' <br />
<br />
Those are the times when Tim wonders if it might hurt less if they just slapped him.<br />
<br />
To be fair, Bruce hasn't pulled any of that shit on him yet, but Tim has also not known him for all that long--certainly not in a parental capacity. It's been about a month since the Waynes started fostering him, and so far he's been careful to stick to the rules and stay on Bruce's good side as much as possible. <br />
<br />
But of course, that can't always be the case. Try as one might to avoid upsetting anyone, upsetting things are still bound to happen. Plans get canceled, deals fall through, dinners get burned... and apparently, sometimes, the FBI just shows up and butchers your weeks-long vigilante investigation in a single afternoon. Inevitably,  something  always happens to disrupt the equilibrium, so for times like these, Tim has a  system.  <br />
<br />
It's a system he's used ever since he was little. He thought he'd invented it, until Dick insisted they marathon the Harry Potter movies a while back (after learning Tim had neither seen the films nor read the books, the latter of which seemed to cause Jason physical pain), and Tim heard that odd British boy wizard articulate the very strategy that Tim's been employing since he first learned to recognize the signs of his parents' frustration at the age of four:<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I don't exist.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a solid strategy--one that's seen Tim through company merger fails, parental fights, illnesses, injuries, and that one horrible time Jack tried to cancel their family's TracFone Wireless contract and ended up on hold with customer service for over four hours. It's a strategy that has never failed Tim yet.<br />
<br />
So for the rest of the afternoon, he follows Harry's lead and does his best to disappear.<br />
<br />
Tim is lying on his bed with headphones in, staring up at the spinning ceiling fan and listening to a podcast about F-15 fighter jets. He's just debating whether or not to risk tiptoeing down to the kitchen to snag a couple protein bars for dinner, when a knock on his bedroom door pulls him out of his reverie. <br />
<br />
Uncovering one ear, he props himself up on his elbows. &quot;Yeah- or, I mean, yes?&quot; he calls, remembering his manners just a split second too late.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey kiddo! You decent in there?&quot; an overly cheerful voice greets, and Tim instantly frowns. This was certainly not part of tonight's plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dick?&quot; He's up and moving in an instant, headphones abandoned on bed. Reaching the door, he opens it and stares in confusion at the older boy's grinning face. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Dick deadpans. He places a hand over his heart and shakes his head slowly back and forth. &quot;I'm really feeling the love tonight, Timmy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, wait'll you see Bruce,&quot; Jason pipes up, emerging from his own bedroom across the hall. &quot;I don't think he's said two words since hanging up on Gordon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim's stomach twists at the reminder of Bruce's mood, but Dick just laughs and says, &quot;Oh my god, did he go full-caveman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Full  caveman,&quot; Jason confirms. &quot;Pretty sure Alfred only invited you to dinner so you can interpret his Gruntish to English.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick hums solemnly. &quot;The hardest part is differentiating between 'hn' and 'hnn.'&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason snorts. &quot;Don't forget 'hhnngg.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You gotta roll your G's more,&quot; Dick quips, then ducks, laughing, as Jason attempts to whack him over the head.  <br />
<br />
Tim just stands there, watching all of this unfold from his bedroom doorway, utterly baffled. So... Bruce is apparently in a mood bad enough that he's not speaking to anyone, and-<br />
<br />
And Alfred invited Dick over for  dinner?? <br />
<br />
Why would he do that? Literally  why?  It makes no sense. None. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Adults don't want  company  when they're pissed off--they want to be left  alone.  They want peace and quiet, and maybe a couple glasses of wine and a pint of super premium ice cream and a stupid HGTV program to aggressively shout their frustrations at  (&quot;The bungalow's got an ocean view, idiot!&quot;  he can still hear Jack hollering from the den after a particularly bad day at the office,  &quot;That trumps indoor jacuzzi any day!&quot;).  <br />
<br />
The last thing in the world they want is  kids  bothering them.<br />
<br />
Then again, Dick isn't really a kid anymore. He's twenty-two, making him a whole-ass adult--even if he still sprawls out on the sofa with Tim and Jason every other weekend to watch Spongebob reruns--and somewhere underneath all the jokes, Jason  is  kind of implying that he knows how to handle Bruce when he's like this... Maybe he's here to play buffer or something?<br />
<br />
No. That doesn't seem right.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Unless... <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;...Hello! Earth to Tim.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim blinks, suddenly registering that a hand is waving up and down in front of his face. Jason--the owner of the hand--is giving him a funny look. &quot;You good, man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tim says, shaking his head to clear it. &quot;Yeah. Sorry, just zoned out for a sec.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you'd better zone back in.&quot; Dick grins, nudging him toward the stairs. &quot;Alfie's making  croquetas de gambas to cheer B up, and they're about a million times better fresh out of the fryer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim has no idea what 'croquetas de gambas' are, but it's not like fried food is ever  bad.  Especially if Alfred makes it. He's mostly just hung up on the first part of that statement. &quot;Wait, so... we're still eating dinner together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah?&quot; Jason blinks at him. &quot;Why wouldn't we?&quot; he asks, like it's absurd that Tim would even question such a thing.<br />
<br />
Dick's smile has faded a little too, replaced with a look of mild concern. &quot;You feeling okay, Timmy?&quot; He reaches a hand out like he's going to press it to Tim's forehead, but Tim steps backwards, evading it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine,&quot; Tim says quickly. Dick and Jason getting all dramatic and making a scene out of absolutely  nothing definitely  will certainly not improve anyone's mood. &quot;You just woke me up from a nap, that's all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason's brow furrows. &quot;Since when do you take naps?&quot;<br />
<br />
But before Tim can so much as open his mouth to retort, the Manor's seldom-used intercom system buzzes, making him jump.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Boys,&quot;  Bruce's clipped voice grunts over the wall panel speaker.  &quot;Dinner.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dick reaches over and presses the button. &quot;Ayy, it speaks!&quot; he exclaims into the mic while Jason snickers in the background. &quot;Didn't know you had it in you, B!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Hn,&quot;  comes Bruce's only reply.<br />
<br />
Dick releases the intercom button and turns back around to the other two. &quot;That one means 'hurry up, the croquetas are getting cold,'&quot; he translates sagely.<br />
<br />
Tim nods and takes the stairs two at a time.<br />
<br />
Dinner is...  stressful,  to say the least.<br />
<br />
Jason was right, Bruce  does seem pretty down--though granted, he doesn't really look like he's two seconds away from lashing out the way Tim's parents always do when they're upset about something, nor is he making a bunch of snide remarks at everyone around him to keep them in their place. He mostly just sits there, looking deep in thought and chewing his food slowly and methodically, like he's going over every detail of the case in his head, line by line, trying to figure out where exactly he'd gone wrong.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't be so bad, Tim thinks, if Dick and Jason didn't keep on  purposely bothering him. <br />
<br />
&quot;More  croquetas,  old man?&quot; Jason asks, holding up the basket full of deep-fried... whatever they are. They kind of remind Tim of hush puppies, except that they're filled with some kind of minced-up meat (chicken? fish?) suspended in a creamy white sauce. They taste fine, and apparently they're one of Bruce's favorite foods, but it's kind of hard to enjoy them with the way Tim's stomach keeps twisting around nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph,&quot; Bruce grunts back, gaze still fixed straight ahead of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;'No thank you, I would rather stare at this wall and ponder why it is that the powers that be take such delight in afflicting my poor soul with nothing but suffering and pain,'&quot; Dick translates in a deep parody of Batman's signature gravelly voice, earning a very unamused look from his father, &quot;'but see if Timmy wants another.'&quot;<br />
<br />
Without missing a beat, Jason stabs one of the fried objects with the serving fork and whirls around to hold it out to Tim. &quot;Croqueta?&quot; he offers.<br />
<br />
Tim shakes his head wordlessly. He's still on his first, and unless his stomach starts behaving soon, he doesn't think he's even going to get that one down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suit yourself,&quot; Jason shrugs. Then, reaching across the table, he deposits the rejected croqueta directly onto Bruce's plate. &quot;All yours, Grumpy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hn.&quot; Bruce rolls his eyes, but picks it up anyway and takes a bite.<br />
<br />
&quot;'I am only eating this because I do not like to waste food, but know that it does nothing to appease my mental anguish,'&quot; Dick interprets, voice rumbling, and Bruce just gives him a glare that makes Tim's insides twist again. <br />
<br />
It must not have the same effect on Dick, however, who merely grins and adds in his gravelliest voice, &quot;'Alexa, play the song of my people.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Now playing 'In the End,' by Linkin Park,&quot;  the automated voice replies over the room's speakers, and Jason dissolves into  cackles. <br />
<br />
(Tim, meanwhile, would rather be literally anywhere else than at this table.)<br />
<br />
Alfred clears his throat. &quot;Boys,&quot; he says sternly, &quot;that is quite enough, I should think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason's shoulders are still shaking with mirth, but Dick at least has the decency to look a little sheepish. &quot;Sorry, Alfie,&quot; he says. Then, at the butler's twin raised eyebrows, he turns to Bruce and adds, &quot;Sorry, B.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmn,&quot; Bruce acknowledges, then resumes his mostly silent dinner.<br />
<br />
After that, Dick and Jason launch into a heated debate over which mid-2000s emo bands are classic and which are simply cringe. Bruce occasionally adds his two-cents in the form of vague grunts, but Dick stops providing translations, so Alfred quits glaring at them.<br />
<br />
Overall, the tension in the room seems to be dissipating, but for whatever reason, Tim's body hasn't gotten the memo. The longer he sits there trying to eat, the more his chest and throat keep constricting, to the point that he's expending most of his energy just trying to keep his breathing even. The next bite of croqueta seems to stick to his throat, and Tim nearly gags when he tries to swallow it down.<br />
<br />
The others are caught up debating whether Evanescence or MCR are the true lords of emo, so they don't pay any mind when Alfred leans in close to Tim's ear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not a fan of prawns, I take it?&quot; he whispers kindly.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Prawns?&quot; The word triggers a vague memory somewhere in the back of Tim's mind, though he can't quite recall why.<br />
<br />
&quot;A type of crustacean, belonging to the same family as shrimp,&quot; Alfred explains, inclining his head minutely to the half-eaten croqueta on Tim's plate. &quot;The Spanish call them  gambas.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Oh fuck. <br />
<br />
<br />
In horror, Tim's mind flashes back to an incident when he was eight. It was his father's birthday, and his parents were actually in town for once, so they'd gone out to dinner at a local seafood restaurant with a few of their friends and taken Tim along with them. <br />
<br />
Tim hadn't eaten much for lunch that day. Mrs. Clemmings, his nanny at the time, had packed him a liverwurst and sweet pickle sandwich to take to school. He'd told her several times that he didn't like liverwurst, but either it was her age making her forgetful, or else she just didn't care, but either way, Tim was ravenous by the time they'd made it to the restaurant. He'd cleared half his child-sized plate of shrimp fettuccine before the dinner rolls were even gone--earning him a few glares from Janet and a hissed reminder in his ear to 'mind his manners.' He couldn't help it; he was hungry and it was just so good.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later, he was kind of regretting it though when his stomach was hurting. He didn't tell his mother at first--he knew she'd only scold him and tell him that's what he gets for eating too quickly--but then his lips started feeling sort of weird and tingly, and his skin got kind of itchy, and even as a little kid, Tim could tell that wasn't normal.<br />
<br />
Urgently, he'd tugged at his mother's sleeve, but she was busy relaying some story about a dig in Cambodia, so she just held up a finger to say 'don't interrupt me right now.'<br />
<br />
(Unfortunately, that's exactly what Tim did when he'd vomited all over her nine hundred dollar designer dress a few moments later.)<br />
<br />
His stomach churns at the memory, and along with the nausea comes a wave of pure panic, and  nope, nuh-uh, not happening,  Tim is  not about to make Bruce's terrible day even worse by vomiting the man's favorite comfort food all over the dinner table.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, they're great, uh - &quot; Tim stammers, getting to his feet. His stomach clenches, protesting the sudden movement. &quot;Sorry, I'll be right back, okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
He doesn't wait for an answer from Alfred before stiffly fleeing the table.<br />
<br />
He makes it into the bathroom and locks the door behind him, then hunches over the sink, gripping the basin with both hands and breathing as evenly as he can to try and quell the growing nausea.<br />
<br />
This is all his fault. Why didn't he think to ask what the heck 'gambas' were before eating them? He's usually so careful to avoid shrimp--always looking up the ingredients in restaurant dishes online before ordering them and reading labels on packaging when he tries new foods. On nights when his parents order takeout and forget to specify 'no shrimp,'  he's  always the one to notice and then make himself a PB&amp;J for dinner instead. But Alfred hasn't served shrimp even once since Tim arrived, so he just hadn't been expecting it. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;God, he's so stupid. <br />
<br />
<br />
At least he didn't eat very much. Half a croqueta is nothing in the grand scheme of things compared to a whole plate of pasta, right? He just needs to get his stomach under control and he can go back to the table and everything will be fine. No one will have to know. <br />
<br />
His gut rumbles in warning.  Shit shit shit.  He takes a deep breath and it catches in his throat, strangling him. Someone is gonna hear if he throws up, and if someone hears, someone will get Bruce, and that is probably the worst thing that could happen to him right now. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;C'mon Tim. In through the nose, out through the mouth,  he mentally chants.  Just calm the fuck down, you're not gonna throw up... <br />
<br />
Bruce is gonna be angry. God, no, Bruce is gonna feel  guilty. He's gonna blame himself for Tim getting sick all because Tim is an idiot who freaked out like a baby over Bruce's bad day and didn't pay attention to the one thing he's supposed to pay attention to.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;In through the nose, out through the mouth. In through the nose, out through the mouth...  <br />
<br />
The sound of knuckles rapping against the bathroom door startles him back to the present.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Tim?&quot; Dick's voice calls gently from just outside. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah,&quot; Tim forces out, even though he's feeling about the furthest thing from alright at the moment. &quot;Sorry, I- I just need a few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
He can almost hear Dick's frown. &quot;That's fine. I'm not trying to rush you. You just left the table really fast, and you looked like you weren't feeling well, so we got kind of concerned.&quot;<br />
<br />
(Great, they're all talking about him now. So much for not making a scene.)<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm totally fine,&quot; Tim says around shaky breaths. &quot;You don't- don't have to worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Dick sounds skeptical. &quot;You're breathing kinda weird...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim sucks in another breath through his tightening throat, &quot;Yeah. I'm just, uh-&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I'm just, what?  his brain demands.  Freaking the fuck out? Regretting my life choices? Trying not to puke everywhere?  <br />
<br />
&quot;...I just don't think the food is really agreeing with me,&quot; is what Tim finally settles on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay. I'm sorry,&quot; Dick says, a little awkwardly. If Tim wasn't so preoccupied trying not to throw up at the moment, he'd probably feel embarrassed, but there are far more pressing matters than his personal dignity. &quot;How about I get you some water?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sure,&quot; Tim agrees distractedly as the back of his jaw starts tingling and he wills his stomach contents to stay down. Anything to get him to leave. &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Dick says. &quot;I'll be right back, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Tim can answer, another voice comes from a little further down the hall.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Is he alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Jason,  Tim registers, and his heart starts hammering faster. If Jason's checking on him now, then it's only a matter of time before Alfred comes, and then Bruce is going to feel obligated to see if he's okay and it's not like Tim can say,  'Yeah, no, sorry, your completely justifiable pissiness was wigging me out to the point that I wasn't paying attention to what I was eating and now I'm pretty sure I'm about to ralph everywhere, so I think I'll just hang out here until everyone stops having emotions, alright?' <br />
<br />
&quot;He's just not feeling very well,&quot; Dick replies, quieter now. Or maybe it just seems that way because the anxious thoughts swirling in Tim's head are drowning everything else out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Jason's voice is low. &quot;Is that why he was being weird before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he's been like, hiding in his room all day...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim opens his mouth, fully intending to reassure them that  he's totally fine,  and that they can  definitely just go back to dinner, but that's as far as he gets before his stomach lurches again. He stumbles over to the toilet, barely managing to flip the lid up before he's throwing up everything he's eaten that day.<br />
<br />
Vaguely, he's aware of Dick and Jason's worried voices, but between the sound of his retching and the ringing in his ears, Tim can't make out much of what they're saying. The doorknob rattles a few times, but it doesn't open.<br />
<br />
Tim just stays hunched over the toilet, gasping out breaths and trying to force his stomach to calm down. He wishes it would stop. He wishes Jason and Dick would go away. He wishes he hadn't come down for dinner at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;-does not sound good to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's just throwing up, Jay. No one sounds good when they're throwing up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's hyperventilating!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay...&quot; More knocking, a little harder now. &quot;Hey Tim? I know you're sick, but do you think you can open the door? We just want to make sure you're okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim clutches the toilet seat to ground himself. &quot;Good - I'm good.&quot; He tries to suck air in and feels it get stuck in his throat. His words come out hoarse, painful. &quot;I'm - fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
There's more back and forth whispering, from which all Tim can make out clearly is Jason's hiss of  &quot;-lying through his teeth!&quot;  and then there's a pause outside the door so long that Tim can't tell if his audience has left, or if the sound of his heart pounding frantically in his ears has finally made him go deaf.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a new voice, gruffer, deeper, says, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; and Tim goes cold all over. That's Bruce. That's Bruce speaking a full sentence for the first time today and of course it's when Tim is hurling his guts out in the bathroom and didn't want him to know about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Shit.  <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Picking the lock,&quot; Jason says, like it's obvious. &quot;Didn't think you'd appreciate me breaking the door down. I can, if you want. I am absolutely fine with that option actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruce sighs. Someone says something else, low, urgent, and Tim rests his forehead against the toilet seat as tears start to spill down his cheeks.<br />
<br />
As a kid, Tim always used to cry when he threw up. It was one part the awful misery of his stomach cramping and one part some automatic bodily response he couldn't really explain. Usually it was his revolving door of nannies over the years who'd deal with him when he was ill, but a particular image has still managed to burn itself into his brain--his parents standing in the doorway, their noses scrunched up and a pile of suitcases behind them.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Honestly, Timothy, don't you think you're getting a little old for all the hysterics?&quot; his mother had said. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;She's right,&quot;  his dad supplied, checking the time on his phone.  &quot;What would your friends at school say if they saw you like this? You're a big boy now, aren't you? Big boys don't cry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Right,&quot;  nine-year-old Tim had agreed, wiping snot from his face, and then threw up all over the floor and made his parents late for their flight.<br />
<br />
(He'd thought he was over his tears after that, but it seems old habits die hard.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim?&quot; someone murmurs. &quot;Bud, can you open the door for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's Bruce again, his voice filled with a forced kind of calm. It's the same tone he uses as Batman when he comes across spooked victims, which only makes Tim feel  more pathetic.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm - I'm okay,&quot; Tim wheezes. He will be, if he can just get everyone to stop standing outside the door and let him calm down. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure you are,&quot; Bruce says, placating. &quot;But you sound like you're having some trouble breathing. I just need to check on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it!&quot; Jason cheers, and Tim hears the click of the doorknob opening.<br />
<br />
A split second later, Bruce is in the bathroom and kneeling beside him. He cups a warm hand on the back of Tim's neck, making him shiver. &quot;Hey Tim, can you tell me what's going on?&quot; <br />
<br />
Tim wipes his sleeve over his mouth. &quot;It's - Sorry,&quot; he chokes out through the tears and gaspy breaths.  This is so dumb.  Tim isn't a baby anymore, so why on earth is he still crying like one? &quot;Sorry. 'm - fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, clearly,&quot; Jason scoffs from just outside the bathroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;We think he's got some kind of bug,&quot; Dick offers, addressing Bruce. &quot;He was taking a nap earlier, and Jay says he's been really quiet all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim shakes his head fervently. The last thing he needs is Bruce thinking he's properly sick and he needs to take care of him or something when this is all just some stupid mistake on Tim's part. &quot;No. It's not-&quot; He gasps. &quot;It's just the shrimp.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The shrimp?&quot; Bruce echoes.<br />
<br />
Tim bobs his head. &quot;It always makes - makes me sick,&quot; he explains. He heaves in a breath, air rattling loudly in his chest. At the same time a sharp hiss issues from the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; Jason says, and then he's gone, his footsteps echoing against the hardwood as he runs. <br />
<br />
Tim glances up, blinking through his tears. &quot;I'm - sorry, I'll stop,&quot; he says, cursing his stupid emotions. &quot;Sorry. I'm just - it's nothing. It's dumb.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bruce gives Tim's nape a reassuring squeeze. &quot;Buddy, are you maybe allergic to shrimp?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Tim's stomach recoils. His fingers are starting to feel a little numb, almost detached from him entirely as they knock into the front of Bruce's shirt and twist for a second before Tim realizes what he's doing. <br />
<br />
And what  was  he doing?<br />
<br />
Oh. Right. Bruce asked him a question.<br />
<br />
He swallows. &quot;Uh - yeah. Kinda. But not - uh, not -  bad like this. This is -&quot;<br />
<br />
Shifting into a calculated voice, Bruce asks, &quot;Your allergy isn't normally this bad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim shakes his head, which is exactly the wrong thing to do. He opens his mouth to explain (this whole thing is just him being childish and way too dramatic over nothing), but something moves into motion, and before he can process it, Bruce is helping him up enough to sit him down on a now-closed toilet seat. He squats in front of Tim, fingers prodding along his neck, tilting his jaw up. <br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn't look like you're swelling anywhere,&quot; Bruce says, and pulls out an honest-to-god  penlight  to shine into Tim's mouth.<br />
<br />
Dick, at least, seems to be as perplexed about it as Tim is. &quot;Do you just carry that around with you?&quot; he asks, leaning over Bruce's shoulder to watch. The movement is laced in false ease, but Tim can see what he's really doing--analyzing, taking stock of symptoms, switching so subtly into Nightwing that if Tim wasn't paying attention he might have missed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hush,&quot; Bruce mutters gently. To Tim, he asks, &quot;How bad are your allergies normally? Do you have an EpiPen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no,&quot; Tim says. Even  if his allergy had ever been bad enough to warrant one, his parents would've probably scoffed at the idea. It's not like Tim even got officially diagnosed anyway. Why would he? A doctor would just tell him what he already knows: look out for foods with shrimp in them, check in with waiters at galas and restaurants, kindly remind his confused parents why he can't eat the Tuscan butter shrimp being brought to their table when they forget.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;(&quot;Since when don't you like shrimp, Timothy?&quot;) <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Um. I usually just throw up,&quot; Tim admits around heavy breaths. &quot;But not - &quot; He gestures at his messy face, hoping Bruce gets the message.<br />
<br />
&quot;B,&quot; Dick mutters, leaning into Bruce's ear. He whispers something, but all Tim can make out clearly over the sound of his own gasping breaths is &quot;anxiety.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bruce nods back. &quot;Okay. Tim?&quot; he says calmly, &quot;Why don't we all try taking some deep breaths together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A breathing party,&quot; Dick chimes in, and grins at the way Bruce fondly rolls his eyes. &quot;Here I'll lead.&quot; He inhales--a big, dramatic sound--motioning for Tim to follow along. <br />
<br />
Tim blinks a few times. &quot;What -?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just humor me, Timmy,&quot; Dick says, and takes another big breath.<br />
<br />
It's weird, but Tim does what he's told, trying to match Dick and listening to the way his own breaths come out shaky and stuttered. No one seems to mind. Bruce just murmurs encouragements his way, every few seconds saying things like, &quot;You're doing great, Tim,&quot; and, &quot;Good job, bud.&quot; <br />
<br />
It's weirder yet that it  does  start to make Tim feel better, despite how mortifying this whole situation is. But Dick keeps breathing with him, and Bruce keeps nodding along. Tim comes more and more back to himself, and as he does, he realizes he somehow missed the fact both Jason and Alfred are standing in the doorway. <br />
<br />
&quot;I got the Epi from the cave,&quot; Jason says, panting. <br />
<br />
Oh. Tim hadn't been paying much attention to why Jason left. Was he running around this whole time?<br />
<br />
&quot;And I have brought oral medication,&quot; Alfred chimes in. He's got a tray full of different colored bottles. Dick takes them from him with a quiet  thanks.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm okay now,&quot; Tim insists, swallowing hard and feeling his cheeks burn with embarrassment. &quot;I - I was just freaking out. I don't know why.&quot; It's a lie, but Tim doesn't have the heart to tell Bruce the truth right now. Honestly, he's kind of hoping he'll never have to explain the full reason for his little freak out at all. Bruce might let it go. Tim is kind of a disaster anyway, so he probably wouldn't push it.<br />
<br />
Dick nudges his shin with the back of his wrist. &quot;Tim, I don't know how to tell you this, but you  are  actually having an allergic reaction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
Bruce picks up Tim's arm and turns it over. &quot;You're getting a rash,&quot; he says, showing Tim the red bumps on his skin. Oh. That explains the itchiness. &quot;Though I don't see any evidence that your airway is swelling. Your breathing sounds better now. What do you think? Should we just try some Benadryl?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim hesitates for a moment. His throat definitely feels tighter than usual, but it's not  all that different  from other times Tim has gotten really upset. Sure, he's still a bit nauseous, and there's a headache pounding behind his eyes--likely from the mortifying cry-fest he just had--but all things considered, he's pretty sure he's through the worst of it now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, the Benadryl should be enough,&quot; he says. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like hell!&quot; Jason blurts. <br />
<br />
Bruce glances over his shoulder at him. &quot;Jay,&quot; he chides, but the boy is paying him no mind. His eyes are sharp and serious, and he's clutching the EpiPen like a sword, waving it back and forth in the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, but are we really gonna believe him when he says he's fine? Like he's been so honest about his health before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jay,&quot; Bruce tries again. &quot;I know you're worried, but -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-uh,&quot; Jason interrupts. &quot;No way. This isn't about my feelings. This is about trusting Tim's  incredibly skewed judgment  when it comes to keeping himself alive. I mean, are we forgetting about that time he literally hid a stab wound? Remember when he didn't tell anyone he was fucking dying of sepsis? Cause I sure haven't forgotten.&quot;<br />
<br />
No one bothers to reprimand him for the language. Bruce shares a look with Dick, a hush fallen over them like everyone has realized something Tim hasn't. Dick gives a small nod of acknowledgment. He silently passes all the medicine bottles over and then stands to throw an arm around Jason's shoulders.<br />
<br />
Jason scowls. &quot;Stop it, Dickface,&quot; he says, and swats him away.<br />
<br />
Dick laughs. It's fake, Tim notes, which is strange. He raises his hands in surrender, but he leans in a little closer and says, softly enough that he must think Tim can't hear, &quot;It's okay, Jaybird. Use your Robin eyes and analyze the situation. What do you see?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason's lips purse together. Tim can't tell what he does end up seeing in him, because Bruce chooses this moment to measure out a cup of the sticky pink liquid and pass it to Tim. It tastes horrible going down, and Tim coughs a few times, wincing. His throat feels wrecked. <br />
<br />
&quot;We'll need to monitor you for a while, okay?&quot; Bruce says, capping the Benadryl bottle and setting it on the counter. &quot;To make sure you don't get worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim squirms, fists clenching at his side to stop from scratching. This is so embarrassing. He just wants to go to bed and pretend this never happened. He's already made Bruce's night so much worse. Having to babysit Tim for the next few hours is a nightmare. &quot;Really, you don't have to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim,&quot; Jason says. &quot;Timmy, Timbo. Just shut up, okay? We're not letting you pull this shit again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Again.  The word hangs heavy in the air, and suddenly Tim  remembers.  He remembers lying on his bed alone in a tangle of sweat-soaked sheets, half-delirious with fever and pain. He remembers hearing someone sob and not even registering that it was himself. He remembers a voice, a hand on his brow, urgent questions that he'd been too out of it to even comprehend, let alone answer. He remembers the stench of the wound when it was finally uncovered--remembers the utterly inhuman scream that had torn out of his own throat. He remem</td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">&quot;Where is he?&quot; Green Lantern asked, looking up and down the alley.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; answered Superman warily, &quot;he said he'd be here.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps he is running late?&quot; came Wonder Woman's suggestion.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah right,&quot; huffed Green Arrow, &quot;When have you ever known Batsy to be late?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If anything you'd think he'd be here early,&quot; Flash agreed. &quot;He set up the meeting after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't suppose there's any chance we got the wrong address,&quot; Black Canary joked humorlessly as she began looking around for hidden danger. Batman had sent out a communique to the League to meet in Gotham at this exact location. That in and of itself was strange enough considering how territorial the Dark Knight was, but now that the host was missing from his own party? Something was definitely off about this situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Fan out,&quot; Superman began, but he was cut off by a deafening crash as dozens of black and white drones emerged from every door, dumpster, nook, and cranny of the alley, followed by a high, maniacal laugh.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well, well,&quot; the voice crooned as the largest of the drones began to hover above the League. Its screen showed a pale face with a monocle and top hat grinning menacingly. &quot;Look who we have here. I wasn't sure you would all come. How loyal you are, each of you responding to the Batman's request for a meet. Well you know what they say; birds of a feather!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The League sprung into action as the drones began dive bombing them, shooting small laser blasts and whizzing around the team nearly too fast to keep track of. Canary and Wonder Woman managed to kick quite a few out of the air while the Flash corralled them close enough together for Green Arrow to shoot. Superman and Green Lantern took out as many as they could in the air as the drones swooped downward, hoping to ease the burden of their teammates fighting them closer to the ground. However, no matter how many they took out more seemed to fly in.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you done with Batman?&quot; Superman growled, punching one of the drones out of the sky.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don't you worry, he's safe, for now,&quot; the villain laughed. &quot;We're having a perfectly civilized tea, and I think it's high time you all joined us!&quot; The drones were coming in even faster and it was becoming too much too fast. The League was going to have to regroup, but there was no time.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Think again, Penguin!&quot; came a voice suddenly. The League whirled around to see two figures racing down the alley towards them. Both wore red and looked to be little more than teenagers, though while one wore only a domino mask and carried a staff the other sported a red helmet and what seemed to be a rather impressive arsenal of handheld weapons. Reaching the scene of the action, the one with a staff twirled the weapon expertly to knock down drone after drone while the one in the red helmet shot a grappling hook up towards the roof and used it to swing into quite a few of the drones himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;My my,&quot; said the man on the screen, Penguin as he seemed to be called, &quot;look who came to the party. Red Robin and Red Hood; isn't this a treat?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You know us,&quot; the one in the helmet quipped back, &quot;couldn't resist catching up with an old friend.&quot; He landed with a grunt on top of a drone, crushing it before directing his attention to the team. &quot;The real question is: what are you guys doing in Gotham? Does B know you're here?&quot; he asked before firing the grappler and swinging into action again.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He'll lose it if he finds you,&quot; the other boy said, a hint of laughter in his voice. He jumped out of a drone's path and backflipped up onto the lid of a dumpster. As soon as his feet made contact he slipped, but managed to catch himself with the staff.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice going show off,&quot; his partner laughed, &quot;maybe you should leave the tricks to Nightwing.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And maybe you should leave the comebacks to Spoiler.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Right back atcha!&quot; The two fought the drones without missing a beat as they sparred verbally with each other, like it was second nature.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously though,&quot; the boy in the domino mask said, his focus once again on the League, &quot;what are you guys doing here?&quot; Between the persistence of the drones and the surprise and confusion at the appearance of two teenage costumed allies, the entire team was at a loss for words. After a beat, Superman got his thoughts together enough to respond,<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Batman called and told us to meet him here.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What are YOU doing here?&quot; Flash stopped to ask before zooming back to corral drones.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We were at Batburger,&quot; the one in the domino mask said as though it explained everything. He took out his own grappling hook and swung up to take out another drone, black cape billowing behind him. &quot;We saw the Penguin's drones out the window and came down to see what was going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And now that we've seen it,&quot; the one in the helmet grunted, firing the grappling hook again, &quot;We've seen enough. And I think you have too, Penguin.&quot; The boy leapt into the air and swung up towards the screen. His partner ran towards the bottom of the cable's arc and tossed the staff to him. Catching the weapon just as he reached the central drone, he used it to smash the camera. Suddenly, the rest of the drones began flying erratically.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;They're flying blind,&quot; Green Lantern shouted in realization.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and with no visual intel from the camera Penguin can't send in replacements,&quot; the caped boy shouted back. With no sense of direction the drones were much easier to combat, and with the steady tide of metal attackers stemmed, the Justice League and the two Gotham heroes quickly eliminated the fleet. Finally able to catch their breaths, the League and the strangers looked to each other.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to regroup and find answers,&quot; Wonder Woman said.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But not here,&quot; the helmeted boy said.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We can do this back at the cave,&quot; the caped one said firmly.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; sputtered his friend, &quot;No we can't, nobody's allowed in the cave! You know that; B would have our heads.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not saying we take them IN the cave.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, we'll just have them wait on the lawn while we check the security feeds. Yeah no problems there! It's not like you can see anything identity-revealing from there!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Not on the lawn,&quot; the caped boy said, eye roll evident in his tone even if it was covered by the whites of his domino, &quot;outside the cave.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;In what, the lobby? B didn't exactly put in a waiting room.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah he did.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;When, after I died?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it's always been there.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;How would you know? You weren't even there, Replacement!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Because why would your death make him put in a waiting room?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't say I was the cause! Besides, I was there just today there's no waiting room&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think that big room outside the entrance is?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Decontamination!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Boys!&quot; Wonder Woman interrupted, silencing them instantly, &quot;We will go to the Watchtower. Our first priority must be finding Batman.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Finding Batman?&quot; the two boys asked in unison.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Green Arrow spoke up, &quot;that penguin guy said he has him.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; the helmeted one snarled. &quot;How the hell did that bastard, oh when I get my hands on him-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hood, Hood, calm down,&quot; his partner, evidently the one called Red Robin as the other seemed to be the one Penguin had called Red Hood, &quot;We'll get him. You know Penguin isn't as tough as he likes to pretend he is, especially not since he started hanging around with Riddler. B will be fine. For all we know he planned this himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait wait wait,&quot; the Flash said incredulously, &quot;The 'B' you've been talking about is Batman?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, leadfoot,&quot; Red Hood mocked, &quot;who else would we be talking about?&quot; Green Lantern shook his head.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to 'Batman works alone?'&quot; The two boys stared at the League for a long moment before a wide grin crept onto Red Robin's face.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys have no idea who we are, do you?&quot; The League's silence gave them the answer. Red Robin burst out into a fit of hysterical laughter, while Red Hood groaned in exasperation tinged with the faint hint of a smile.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Red Hood sighed, &quot;of course he's too stubborn and paranoid to have mentioned us.&quot; The League stared in confusion, waiting for an elaboration that seemed less and less likely with every one of Red Robin's laughs.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Superman prompted after a few moments, &quot;who exactly are you? How do you know Batman?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We're his associates,&quot; Red Robin answered as he came down off of his laughing fit, clearly not wanting to say too much.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We're his kids,&quot; answered his brother, smirk obvious in his voice.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; shouted the entire League.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hood!&quot; Red Robin scolded as Red Hood roared with laughter.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You're his kids?&quot; Black Canary repeated.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He HAS kids?&quot; Green Arrow asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He kept his kids a secret?&quot; the Flash asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay now that one shouldn't really surprise you,&quot; said the Green Lantern, turning to Flash. &quot;The guy keeps everything a secret. Name one thing you know about him.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, he doesn't like olives,&quot; Flash replied, tone more than slightly catty. &quot;Every time I order a pizza with olives and I offer him a slice he says no.&quot; He put his hands on his hips and smiled at his friend triumphantly. Green Lantern just responded with a sigh. Suddenly the Flash had a thought. &quot;Are there more of you?&quot; he asked, turning to the boys. &quot;Does he have more kids or is it just you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh there's plenty more,&quot; Red Hood grinned cryptically, much to Red Robin's chagrin. He was clearly loving every second of the team's confusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay, we don't have time for this,&quot; Red Robin groaned. &quot;We need to work on getting to Batman.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Superman agreed, &quot;Let's get up to the Watchtower and see what information we can gather.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No need,&quot; replied Red Hood nonchalantly.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He's right, we know everything we need to,&quot; Red Robin agreed. &quot;We only needed to hit the cave security and intel systems to figure out what Penguin was up to. Now that we all know it's a kidnapping as bait for some sort of trap we just need to get there. Hood and I know where he'll be.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; asked Green Arrow.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Gotham,&quot; Red Robin grinned. Red Hood nodded,<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And nobody knows Gotham like us.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The trip to the warehouse where Penguin was holding Batman was filled with questions for the two teen heroes. Eventually everyone asked at least a few, but most were rapid fire queries and curiosities from the Flash.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You said there were more, how many more? Are you biological or adopted? Do you have a mom? Are you all crime fighters? Do you all only go out at night? Do you really live in a cave or is that just a codename for your base? Is Batman human or is he part bat? Does he have echolocation powers? Do you have echolocation powers? Does he actually not like olives or is it just pizza in general? Does he sleep hanging upside down? Is he nocturnal? Is that why he only goes out at night and acts grumpy whenever we have a League meeting? Because they're during the day?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Flash!&quot; Black Canary barked, &quot;Shut up!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he said, bouncing with excitement, &quot;It's just really really cool to talk to someone who actually knows things about Batman.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's all good,&quot; Red Hood chuckled, &quot;but if you want any answers you might want to slow down, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, sorry. Okay so earlier you mentioned you had died? Was that like a flatlined in the hospital situation or an evil witch resurrection type deal or-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We're here,&quot; Red Robin interrupted. They had stopped a block away from what seemed to be an old abandoned warehouse. It was perfect for hiding a kidnapping victim and laying a trap, and what was more was that the town seemed to be full of them. They had passed at least three similar buildings on the way over, and the team's biggest question was becoming not &quot;where would the Penguin hide?&quot; but rather &quot;how did these two kids know which of the hiding spots he had chosen?&quot; The League was really starting to understand why Gotham was the way that it was.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is clearly a trap,&quot; Green Arrow remarked.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh definitely,&quot; the boys agreed.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, so what do we do?&quot; That same sly grin crept back onto Red Robin's face.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We get caught.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Penguin and his goons were standing in the warehouse keeping an eye out for the inbound heroes. Standard patrol procedures were in place and every square foot of the place was covered. Then: a sound. Catching a glimpse of the small metal object rolling across the floor, the guards in the northwestern quadrant dove for cover.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Bomb!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The explosion echoed throughout the nearly empty warehouse, but no flames roared in to follow.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's only a smoke bomb you incompetent bafoons!&quot; Penguin yelled. &quot;Get to the prisoner!&quot; The goons rushed to where Batman was tied to a chair only to find Wonder Woman and Red Robin working to free him. Charging to push them away, the henchmen suddenly whirled around at the sound of gunfire. Looking around to find the source they saw Black Canary and Green Lantern beating up their colleagues right and left as Superman and Green Arrow shot the backup drones out of the sky while the Flash ran dizzying circles around the other goons. But none of them seemed to have a gun. Another round of shots rang out through the confusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Over here, rockhoppers!&quot; Red Hood shouted from atop a pile of crates. The goons ducked for cover and this time the gun the Hood fired was his grappler as he swung across the warehouse. Batman grunted angrily from behind his gag at the display. &quot;Relax old man,&quot; Red Hood said on the downswing past his mentor, &quot;they're nonlethal.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The Justice League seemed to have the upper hand when suddenly a deafening electronic tone pierced through the warehouse catching the heroes off guard. In the momentary pause the goons were able to catch them, and within minutes all eight heroes were tied to chairs right alongside the Dark Knight.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well, well, what do we have here?&quot; cooed Penguin. &quot;A whole flock of heroes in one nest.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You already used that one,&quot; Red Hood (ungagged due to their kidnappers' inability to remove his helmet) retorted, earning him a blow to the head from a guard. Batman growled.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;That ought to teach you some respect,&quot; Penguin smiled.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Not likely,&quot; Red Robin scoffed, now also ungagged after having managed to work his way out of it. Penguin swiveled towards him and smiled eerily.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Red Robin. Have you finally gotten rid of that hideous black cowl for good or did you merely lose it in the wash?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Penguin,&quot; Red Robin parroted, &quot;Have you finally stopped driving that ridiculous oldsmobile or are you still stuck in the Roaring Twenties?&quot; Predictably a guard hit him for the comment. Once again Batman growled. The Penguin turned to the League and grinned as he swaggered down the line.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Kids today have no class, no style. It's a tragedy, truly.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of style,&quot; Red Hood cut in, &quot;this isn't yours. So riddle me this, Penguin, where is he?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I'm glad you asked! My dear friend Riddler is away just now on business, important things I'm sure you can imagine,&quot; he said with a wink, &quot;but I thought I'd borrow a page from his book of tricks. I'm so glad you noticed, though I hope you'll agree I've put my own flare on things.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Red Hood agreed, &quot;like for instance your puzzle took no time at all to solve.&quot; The guard reached to hit him again but Red Hood threw his head back as the hand neared, smashing into it with the hard helmet. He snickered as the goon shouted in pain. &quot;How about you focus on teaching your guards respect, eh snow boy?&quot; The League could almost swear they heard Batman...chuckle?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so?&quot; Penguin sneered. &quot;So I suppose you worked it all out then? Master detective that you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hood's right,&quot; Red Robin hummed, &quot;it was simple. Take Batman, use his League communicator to send out a fake message, fight the JLA to establish yourself as a threat, lead them here to Batman, and capture them.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And don't forget about the drone tech he stole from Wayne Enterprises,&quot; Red Hood added.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Highest grade on the market today,&quot; Red Robin acknowledged. &quot;Could use it for the illegal surveillance W.E. won't grant the usage rights for, not to mention flood the market to drive W.E. out of business.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Allowing you to buy the company and seize control with the profits from your stolen tech,&quot; Red Hood said, finishing his brother's thought, &quot;wiping out funding to all the organizations that W.E. supports and thereby giving you control of most of the city.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And priming you for a partnership with Lexcorp,&quot; noted Red Robin, &quot;and by extension Lex Luthor.&quot; The explanation once again passed to Red Hood.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But you can't have Superman snooping around once Luther gets involved, or any of the other heroes once the two of you begin to branch out into other cities. So first,&quot; he set up, dramatically passing the finale to his partner,<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to get rid of the Justice League.&quot; There was a beat of silence followed by the sound of slow clapping.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Very clever, very clever,&quot; Penguin chuckled. &quot;You almost cracked it wide open. But, no one's perfect! In addition to buying Wayne Enterprises and partnering with Lexcorp, I have also arranged to auction off the members of the Justice League to the highest bidder. Just a little something to protect my nest egg.&quot; He grinned at the assemblage of heroes. &quot;Some of you have some very wealthy admirers,&quot; he cackled. He turned back to the young Gothamites and turned his lips down in a fake pout. &quot;So so close to the perfect solve, but alas you just missed one little thing.&quot; Suddenly, a soft beeping came from Red Robin's wrist. The boy's lips curved into a sly smile.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And you missed a few, slick.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Suddenly an ominous laugh floated through the warehouse, light and thrilled and sinister.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; breathed Penguin, looking around wildly, eyes trained on the rafters. &quot;You aren't here! You're chasing Riddler in Venezuela!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone's heads flashed upwards as a loud shattering surprised all of them except the three bats. Outside planning their capture the two young heroes had told the team that after they allowed themselves to be caught the codeword to act would be 'slick.&quot; So the League had been expecting the ropes and the chairs and the villainous monologue, followed by a bought of righteous fury; what they had not been expecting was the legion of brightly colored vigilantes that dropped into the fray from the ceiling on that same cue. The one in blue, whose voice sounded an awful lot like the one belonging to the laugh, stood and faced them.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You rang?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Instantly the heroes sprung into action. Wonder Woman roared and burst through her ropes in a single movement. Superman lasered the bindings holding the Flash and the speedster made quick work of freeing everyone else. Red Robin reared up in his chair and kicked the Penguin full force in the chest while Red Hood did the same to a nearby guard. Powers flared and capes swung as the two groups fought their way through the goons. When they had most of them incapacitated Batman spoke up for the first time.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's Penguin?&quot; he groveled.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There!&quot; shouted a girl in a purple hood, pointing to a stack of crates reaching nearly to the ceiling. There stood Penguin, mere feet away from one of the holes that the surprise guests had made during their dramatic entry.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Give it up Penguin!&quot; Red Robin shouted. &quot;We've got you cornered.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Au contraire,&quot; he simpered, &quot;it seems you have neglected to consider the consequences of your own actions,&quot; Penguin mocked as he gestured to the hole which would provide his escape.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And it seems you have neglected to consider the one advantage we have over you Penguin,&quot; the boy grinned. &quot;Robins can fly.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Right on cue Red Hood and the young man in blue swung into the Penguin on their grapplers from their place in the shadows. They had crept into position as their partner had distracted the mobster, and moved in unison as Red Robin now fired his own grappler and swung over to the villain as he fell. &quot;Not so fast,&quot; he grinned and put a foot on the man's chest.<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest of the heroes came over to see their success, and the members of the Justice League finally had the time to take stock of their new allies. The young man in blue seemed to be the oldest but he could not have been older than his mid twenties. Alongside him were the girl in the purple hood, a girl dressed entirely in black much like Batman, a boy in yellow armor, and a girl with a blue undercut hairdo a bit lighter than the blue insignia on her chest. &quot;Oracle,&quot; Red Robin said into his wrist, adding another person to the League's count, &quot;did we get the data?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Downloaded and copied to all Cave and League servers,&quot; came a young woman's voice.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Good work,&quot; Batman told the young vigilantes, his good nature shocking the League.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Green Arrow spoke up, &quot;what is going on here?&quot; Red Robin grinned.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He did tell you there were plenty more.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You're all his kids?&quot; Green Lantern shouted. Batman's glare instantly fell on Red Robin and Red Hood.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hood told them!&quot; Red Robin yelped immediately.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nice going, Replacement! Just rat me out!&quot; Red Hood shouted back. Batman just sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose as the rest of the kids broke out into laughter.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as they've seen you,&quot; Batman said reluctantly, &quot;you may as well go ahead and introduce yourselves.&quot; The vigilantes in question introduced themselves as Nightwing, Spoiler, Black Bat, Signal, and Bluebird, as well as Oracle keeping tabs on tech and security from a remote location. Suddenly Batman stood up straighter and looked around. &quot;Where's Robin?&quot; he asked, voice trying to conceal a falter, &quot;did we lose Robin?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax,&quot; said Nightwing, clapping Batman on the back like laying a hand on the infamous Dark Knight was an everyday occurrence. &quot;He's at school. It's daytime, remember.&quot; A soft &quot;oh right&quot; fell from the Bat's lips. Introductions out of the way the League looked at this rather large Bat-family, still unsure of what to think.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for your help,&quot; Wonder Woman said warmly, shaking off the awkwardness as well as each of their hands.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; Superman agreed as he did the same. The rest of the League nodded.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But um,&quot; the Flash piped up, &quot;what...did actually happen? How did you guys find us?&quot; The girl called Spoiler smiled.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Red Robin sent out an encrypted communique telling us what was happening. We cut off all the Riddler's communicators when we caught him, and so Penguin thought that we were still occupied and out of the country. That's why he ran this operation now. Luckily, he was wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We were watching from the skylight for an opportunity to move in,&quot; Signal added, &quot;and then we heard the codeword. Apparently Double R had already picked an opportunity,&quot; he smiled.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I planted a receiver when we were hidden by the smoke bomb,&quot; Red Robin explained. &quot;It searched for and copied the information concerning Penguin's little 'buy-a-hero' auction. Oracle sent it to the League computers for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't miss that one little detail, we just needed confirmation&quot; Hood smirked.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know the codeword?&quot; Flash asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's an old one,&quot; Nightwing said with a smile. &quot;I used to back-talk villains when I was a kid-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Used to?&quot; snorted Bluebird with a smirk. Spoiler and the one called Black Bat giggled. Nightwing just stuck his tongue out at them before continuing.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And call them pet names. So B and I came up with one that could work as a codeword if either of us were in danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And wasn't too ridiculous for the old man to say in his intimidation getup,&quot; smirked Red Hood.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Impressive,&quot; Black Canary remarked. &quot;And I can see that the back talking is a family trait. Well, looks like maybe Batman was telling the truth when he said he didn't need our help in his city,&quot; she quipped. The man in question just grunted, prompting a laugh from everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; Green Lantern smiled, &quot;now that we know they exist, want to tell us more about your little family, Batsy?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's that gag when I need it?&quot; the Bat grumbled. The heroes' laughter could be heard for blocks.</td>

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Bruce,&quot; Steve greeted as the scientist wondered into the Avenger's communal living room. &quot;There you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I'm late,&quot; Bruce gave the waiting group an apologetic smile. &quot;I had to finish up my experiment. Sorry to keep you all waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fine,&quot; Natasha smiled at the scientist. &quot;We are waiting on Tony anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Tony is already out,&quot; Bruce said, wiping his glasses on his shirt. He slid them onto his face and blinked at the group. &quot;He said he would he meet us at the Sanctum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stephen Strange, Master of the Mystic Arts had summoned (and Steve was under the impression it was not an invitation and more of a demand) them to the Sanctum to go over some potential threats he had come across. Steve was still a little confused as to what exactly the man does and how exactly he does it. Steve wasn't, however, about to turn up the opportunity to get ahead on some potential threats, no matter where the source came from.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he say why he was going to be late?&quot; Steve frowned, irritation licking under his skin. Tony had a particular habit of being continually called away when it came to meetings.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;He had to pick up Peter,&quot; Bruce said.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Steve sighed, shaking his head. For as long as Steve had known Tony Stark, the man had claimed that he had a son named Peter. The self-proclaimed genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist reputation was many things, but being father was not one of them. At first Steve hadn't believed Tony when he had first mentioned Peter. In fact, the whole team had had a laugh at the ridiculous notion. Apart from Rhodey's who simply shook his head at them and mumbled something snarky under his breath. Tony had rolled his eyes and said that he would introduce Peter to them when he could. The billionaire never did though, always claiming he had forgotten whenever the asked him about it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter again,&quot; Steve sighed, his shoulder's sagging. &quot;How long is he going to use his imaginary child as an excuse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve,&quot; Bruce warned, his look disapproving. &quot;Tony wouldn't lie about a child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that's outlandish for even him,&quot; Sam agreed, crossing his arms over his chest.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't seen any proof,&quot; Clint shrugged. &quot;Maybe the man took one too many hits in that tin can of his.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter is real,&quot; Rhodey said firmly. &quot;And Tony will introduce him to you when he's ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rhodey's right,&quot; Natasha said. &quot;Besides, we're going to be even later if we don't leave now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Steve wanted to ask Rhodey more about Peter and why Tony was 'forgetting' to introduce them to Peter, but Natasha was right and Steve hated being late. &quot;Alright. Everyone to the cars.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As they drove towards the New York Sanctum, Steve couldn't stop thinking about Tony and his claims that he had a child. Tony was always busy, whether it was Stark Industry work, Iron Man, or saving the world with the Avengers, the man never sat still. In all the conversation between Tony and Steve, the billionaire had never given Steve any indication that he liked children. Of course, Tony would sign their papers and pose for a photo with the children that stopped him on the street, but he always had that paparazzi smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tony had never mentioned a mother, which didn't help in his argument that he had a child. Tony didn't bring Peter up often, only when he was late to a meeting. He used the excuse that Peter had needed him or that he had to go pick up Peter from school.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
By the time they pulled up to the Sanctum, Steve had decided that he needed to have a word with Tony about his imaginary son. It was not good for the man's mental health and Steve was tired of him using Peter as an excuse to get out of meetings.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Rhodey knocked on the door to the Sanctum and the door opened with a steady creak but there was no one on the other side. Sharing a glance with one another, the carefully stepped inside. There were voice's just beyond the entrance and Steve took the lead and followed them in.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As he stepped into a large entrance hall, a beautiful staircase leading to rooms unknown, his jaw threatened to drop as he took in the scene before him.  <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tony lounged on the stairs casually. Anyone would think he was relaxed as anything, but Steve could see the sharp glint in his eyes as he eyes tracked movement above him. Beside him, Doctor Stephen Strange sat a little straighter, a small smile tugging on his lips. Both of their attention was on what looked to be a red magic carpet.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The red cloth swooped and dived above them, bright laughter, and giggling erupting around the Sanctum as a young boy sat on top, clutching the fabric tightly in his hands. The boy let out a whoop at the sudden dive, bringing them to eye level.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad look!&quot; the boy cried with delight. &quot;I'm flying!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure are Underoos,&quot; Tony agreed, smiling brightly. Steve saw him turn to Strange. &quot;If that cape drops him, I'll blast you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the Cloak of Levitation,&quot; Stephen glared lightly at Tony. &quot;It is a relic of the mystic arts and has a will of its own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's it's feeling towards eight-year-olds?&quot; Tony asked.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Far more generous than my feelings towards you,&quot; Stephen drawled with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tony opened his mouth to retort but at that moment the red cloth screeched to a halt and wrapped around the boy.  Tony and Stephen jumped to their feet, hurrying down the last remaining steps.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Steve realised very quickly that it wasn't a carpet but rather a cloak. It was far too big for the boy, but it gently lowered him to the ground. It pooled around the boys' legs; the cloak far too big for him. The boy didn't seem to care though as he stared slack jawed at the Avengers.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad look! It's the Avenger's,&quot; the boy gaped at the group.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure is,&quot; Tony said, coming to a stop behind the boy, threading his fingers into the boys' curls and gently massaging. &quot;You guys finally made it. And you always harp on me for being late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who this?&quot; Steve asked, pointing to the little boy.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tony smirked. &quot;Oh, this is my son. Peter. Say hi Underoos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Captain America sir!&quot; Peter beamed, waving grandly.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Steve parroted back, feeling as if he had just missed a step.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tony's son was real. Tony hadn't been lying. Steve had been so sure that Tony had made up a son but here he was, in the flesh. Guilt stabbed at Steve. He should have believed Tony and the shuffling behind him made him think that a few other members were feeling the same guilt.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that you are all here, we may begin,&quot; Stephen said in a deep voice that seemed to rumble through the Sanctum. &quot;We have much to discuss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Underoos, give the wizard back his cape,&quot; Tony said.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Sorcerer Supreme,&quot; Stephen muttered as Peter let out a long drawn 'awwwww'.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The cloak's collar dropped, wrapping more firmly around the boy, making Steve start. How did it do that? Steve blinked as Stephen narrowed his eyes at Peter.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;My shoulders, now,&quot; Stephen commanded.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The cloak's collar shook and gently patted Peter's cheeks, causing the boy to giggle.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Stephen rolled his eyes and let out a deep sigh. &quot;Fine, stay with the boy. You can keep an eye on him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay! Thanks Mr. Wizard,&quot; Peter beamed, darting to hug Stephen around the knees before drawing back and taking Tony's hand.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy it while it lasts, Underoos,&quot; Tony warned. &quot;The cape isn't coming home with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cloak of Levitation,&quot; Stephen corrected with a glare.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tony grinned. &quot;Sure, whatever you say, Wizard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Stephen rolled his eyes and turned on his heel. He started up the stairs, Tony chuckling as he tugged Peter up the stairs after the taller man.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Steve was knocked out of his staring when Rhodey brushed passed him, following Tony and Stephen up the stairs. Steve mentally shook his head and followed along with the rest of the Avengers. When they were done, Steve made a mental note to apologise to Tony. He should have believed them that he had a son.  <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad,&quot; Peter whispered loudly in a way that children did. &quot;Can you ask the Wizard if he could make me a cloak?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Steve grinned as he watched Tony shake his vehemently. &quot;No way. Sorry Underoos. You're not allowed to go flying around until you're at least fifty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about I teach you ancient mystic arts instead,&quot; Stephen said, smirking at Tony.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tony growled. &quot;Don't you dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad please!&quot; Peter begged, tugging on Tony's hand.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Steve chuckled as Tony shot Stephen a furious glare. &quot;I'm going to kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yes, Steve owed Tony a big apology. Fatherhood suited him and Steve was happy to be proven wrong.   <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />

Wei Ying leans back against the bar, peering out at the suits, the dresses. The glitter of watches that cost more than his college tuition, made visible as shoulders are clapped, toasts made. Glossy hair cut and styled in London or Singapore just hours before the wedding and then flown carefully across countries, oceans, to catch the light here, at stupid Wen Chao's insufferable wedding. It's the marital equivalent of a Cheesecake Factory: an inexplicable combination of vulgar expense and utter cheapassery. Red silk shot through with real gold thread drapes artfully over plastic folding tables. There are goodie bags for guests which include earring-sized Tiffany-blue boxes and also fun-size Snickers bars. Wei Ying is being paid twenty bucks an hour to pour sparkling white wine from their absolute lowest price tier into cut-crystal glasses from the 1920s.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Mianmian,&quot; he says thoughtfully, as he watches Wen Chao suck face with Wang Lingjiao across the room. &quot;How long do you give this marriage? A year?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Save your gossip for after we get paid,&quot; Luo Mian advises him. She's polishing glasses again, which she does when her options are Polish Glasses or Lose Her Mind. &quot;Also, I'd give them two kids and a teeny dog before they split up.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm,&quot; Wei Ying says. &quot;That's awfully optimistic.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He has too much pride to split earlier,&quot; she points out, &quot;and she has too little spine. Incoming.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying grunts and pushes off the bar to go bartend. Tend bar. Whatever. &quot;What can I get for you?&quot; he asks the suit-and-dress that just walked up, and then he flicks his eyes up to their faces and exclaims, &quot;Wen Qing! What in the hell are you doing here?&quot; And then he remembers that, of course, Wen Qing is distantly related to Wen Chao.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Suffering,&quot; Wen Qing says darkly. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; Wei Ying says. &quot;Us too. You want a drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;As a woman of medicine,&quot; Wen Qing begins, &quot;I am familiar with the detrimental effects of excessive alcohol consumption, so I would like to request one glass of champagne.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, it's not champagne,&quot; Wei Ying says. &quot;It's sparkling white wine that was seven dollars at Costco. Second of all, I'm sensing a 'but.'&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But,&quot; Wen Qing agrees. &quot;As Wen Chao's only young, pretty female relative, I'm in Wang Lingjiao's bridal party and it has taken all of my strength not to poison everyone involved in this farce of a wedding.&quot; Luo Mian snorts. &quot;Give me whatever's strong and expensive. It's an open bar, right? Give me their money's worth.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we count as involved?&quot; Wei Ying asks, reaching for the nice rum. Nicer rum. The rum that cost more than a dollar an ounce. It still isn't very good. &quot;How do you feel about daiquiris?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel extremely positively about daiquiris. You don't count as involved, you're getting paid to be here,&quot; Wen Qing allows. &quot;All the guests, I mean. A-Ning is so lucky he was busy this weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wen Ning is lucky for a lot of reasons, not the least of which being that he plays video games professionally and has recently started making more money at it than Wei Ying makes bartending. He's playing some tournament right now. &quot;Wen Ning ah,&quot; Wei Ying sighs, squeezing a lime forlornly into the shaker. &quot;Never forget who first taught you how to do a combo in Smash.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, he owes it all to you,&quot; Wen Qing agrees, one eyebrow arched sardonically.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Pshaw,&quot; Wei Ying says, uncomfortably aware that Wen Ning does, in fact, believe he owes it all to Wei Ying, because it was Wei Ying's idea for him to get serious about gaming after they were both thrown out of university. Wei Ying thinks that any gaming-related debt should be cancelled out by the fact that it was his fault they got thrown out at all. &quot;Hey, Wen Qing, meet Mianmian, she's cool,&quot; he says, and starts shaking the daiquiri shaker loudly. He continues shaking as they introduce themselves, and Wen Qing gestures to her companion and introduces him too, although Wei Ying misses his name because of the ice rattling around in his hands. He's very handsome, which is why Wei Ying has not addressed him yet. He gets annoying when he meets new people, Wei Ying knows, and he gets especially annoying when he meets hot people, and he is trying to make tips here.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
When the daiquiri is mixed, he pours it through a strainer into one of the ridiculous fancy glasses, throws a candied lime peel on, and slides it over to Wen Qing, who takes it and drinks half of it in one go.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Good heavens,&quot; Wei Ying says.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not driving, are you?&quot; Luo Mian checks.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wen Qing swallows and says, &quot;No, Lan Zhan is driving for the night,&quot; indicating her companion.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You want any juice?&quot; Wei Ying offers to him. &quot;Soda?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lan Zhan looks at him. His eyes are such a light shade of brown as to be almost amber. &quot;No, thank you,&quot; he says. &quot;Just ice water, if you please.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying raises his eyebrows. So polite! &quot;One artisanal ice water, coming right up,&quot; he says. &quot;Just kidding. It's tap water. You want a lemon? A lime?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No, thank you,&quot; Lan Zhan repeats.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, so boring!&quot; Wei Ying cries, but he gives Lan Zhan his water in a fancy glass anyway. &quot;So, Wen-jiejie, who's this dreadful young man you've brought to meet me, huh? Where did you find him? A library?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Wen Qing says, and doesn't elaborate.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you each other's beards?&quot; Wei Ying guesses, mostly joking.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lan Zhan says, &quot;I don't know what that means.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wen Qing says, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then, to Lan Zhan, she says, &quot;It's what we're doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hn,&quot; Lan Zhan says, with a cautious look at Wei Ying and then Luo Mian.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, don't worry, we're cool,&quot; Wei Ying says quickly. &quot;Wen Qing and I have bearded for each other too. Hey, maybe we should be bitter exes,&quot; he adds to Wen Qing. &quot;Wow. Wen Qing. I can't believe you've brought your new boyfriend. I'm devastated.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I am equally hurt that you've brought your new girlfriend,&quot; Wen Qing says. &quot;I feel replaced.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave me out of this,&quot; Luo Mian says with a grimace. &quot;I didn't cut all ties with my family just to pretend to date a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You date men,&quot; Wei Ying points out. &quot;You're dating a man right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but not <br />
<br />
you,&quot; <br />
<br />
Luo Mian says.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's nothing personal. Your role in my life is to validate me when I whine,&quot; Luo Mian says. &quot;It's a very important role and you perform it excellently.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Wei Ying says, touched.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Interestingly, that's <br />
<br />
my <br />
<br />
role in <br />
<br />
his <br />
<br />
life,&quot; Wen Qing observes.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, except you do less validating and more telling me to start taking better notes,&quot; Wei Ying says. To be fair, taking better notes would solve a lot of the problems that he whines about to Wen Qing. &quot;Hey, if Wen Qing whines to Mianmian, we'll have a nice little ecosystem.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I complain to Lan Zhan,&quot; Wen Qing says. Lan Zhan makes a little sound of agreement. Across the room Wen Chao and Wang Lingjiao have started making out. There's a lot of visible tongue.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well, Lan Zhan can complain to Mianmian,&quot; Wei Ying decides.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Lan Zhan doesn't complain about anything,&quot; Wen Qing dismisses him. &quot;He keeps all his irritation right here --&quot; She gestures at Lan Zhan's chest. &quot;-- and then someday, he'll die.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If nothing is to be done about the problem, it's useless to complain,&quot; Lan Zhan says, his eyes on his glass of water.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, obviously, but there's a difference between complaining about stuff that matters, which sucks, and stuff that doesn't matter, which rocks,&quot; Wei Ying tells him. &quot;Complaining about being forced to perform heterosexuality for your parents and their peers sucks, but complaining about this asinine wedding rocks.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm,&quot; Lan Zhan says. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying gives him his very best Applying Peer Pressure expression. &quot;Do it, Lan Zhan. Say this wedding is tacky and awful and they're both terrible people. You're friends with Wen Qing, I know you're thinking it. Here, here, you don't even need to say it aloud, you can just wink if I'm right.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lan Zhan looks at him with a blank expression. He's not a very expressive person, apparently. Wei Ying holds his gaze and decides that he wants to make him crack.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Then he jumps about a foot in the air as someone crashes into the bar and slurs, &quot;Give me -- oh, fuck, what's she drinking? Give me one of those.&quot; It's Wang Lingjiao, who has somehow separated herself from her new husband and wobbled her way over to sprawl across the bar. They've already given her four glasses of wine, one for each time Wen Chao publicly groped someone other than her.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
And... She's insufferable, but no one deserves Wen Chao. Maybe he can find it in his heart to feel, perhaps, a crumb of sympathy for her. &quot;Long day, huh,&quot; Wei Ying says. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I paying you to chat, or to give me drinks?&quot; she says. Ah, there goes the crumb.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Wei Ying says, and reaches for the rum again. The cheap rum this time. Cheaper. The four of them are silent as he makes the daiquiri. Wang Lingjiao slumps on her stool, blowing air through her lips occasionally. If she were his friend, he would make her drink some water before giving her any more alcohol; she'll have a killer hangover tomorrow either way, but water would mitigate it.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
She is not his friend. He gives her the daiquiri. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Took you long enough,&quot; she says, grabbing the drink, and stumbles away.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying sucks on his teeth in disgust. Luo Mian mutters, &quot;Bitch.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wen Qing curls her lip and says, &quot;She'll have a horrible morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lan Zhan just meets Wei Ying's gaze. One of his finely shaped eyebrows twitches, minuscule and damning. His expression is completely blank when he winks, serious and deliberate, at Wei Ying.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Shocked laughter bubbles up Wei Ying's throat and out of his mouth, fizzes along his shoulders and out through his fingertips. He can feel his ears turning red with the pleasure of being winked at, even under such circumstances and with such an expression, by a beautiful man.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you laughing at?&quot; Luo Mian wonders.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing! Nothing.&quot; Wei Ying makes grabby hands at the polishing cloth. &quot;Give me that, it's my turn to polish some glasses.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Luo Mian says, sounding like she knows exactly why he wants to keep his hands busy. But she hands over the cloth and lets him polish, so she's forgiven for perceiving him. &quot;How do you two know each other?&quot; she asks, and at first he thinks she means Wen Qing and Lan Zhan, which he's also curious about, but then she adds, &quot;My condolences, by the way,&quot; which means she's asking Wen Qing about <br />
<br />
him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We went to the same high school,&quot; Wen Qing says. &quot;He was nice to my brother so he's the only person I still talk to. Also we were lab partners for a semester and Wei Ying let me do all the dissections.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying grimaces. The previous semester he had been paired with some jerk whose name he doesn't even remember anymore who made Wei Ying do all the dissecting because it was gross, and then refused to help write the report about it because, of course, he didn't do any of the dissection. Then the guy got busted for trying to take the lens from the cow eyeball home in his pocket. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying was more than happy to let Wen Qing do all the dissections after that, and she was happy to let him write the reports. By the end of the semester they had the highest grades in the class. Then Wen Qing graduated and went to university, and then the year after that Wei Ying graduated and went to university, and then the year after <br />
<br />
that<br />
<br />
&nbsp;he and Wen Ning both got thrown out. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying clears his throat, then turns it into a scoff. &quot;Hey, I'm still nice to your brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wen Qing leans across the bar to pat his head. &quot;Yeah, you are. Good boy. I know where you live. How do you know each other?&quot; she asks Luo Mian.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;College,&quot; Luo Mian says. She hadn't been kicked out, but her family had pulled all their financial support and she'd had to drop out and finish her degree at a community college.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We almost dated,&quot; Wei Ying chirps.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We did not almost date,&quot; Luo Mian says. &quot;You flirted with me one time and then I was mean to you about it forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; Wei Ying says, &quot;I love when people are mean to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Luo Mian rolls her eyes. &quot;You want another daiquiri?&quot; she offers to Wen Qing.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; Wen Qing says with feeling, handing her empty glass over. &quot;Less sugar, more rum this time, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You got it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;A-Qing? Is that you over there?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wen Qing straightens and turns, a real smile blooming over her face. &quot;Popo ah! Where have you been all evening, I thought you must have gone home,&quot; she says in Mandarin to the approaching Madam Wen, who is approximately ten thousand years old and one of Wei Ying's favorite people on the fucking planet.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been hiding in the ladies' room,&quot; Madam Wen admits in her creaky old lady voice. Wen Qing takes her hand and tugs her close. &quot;What a shame, my little nephew, what a shame. What sort of wedding! Is that little Wei Ying back here? A-Ying, come here and let Popo see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying grins and leans across the bar so that Madam Wen can cup his face in her hands, which are soft and wrinkly and smell of soap and powder. He lets her squish his cheeks and inspect his eyes and tongue, just in case. &quot;First Wen Qing and now Popo is here,&quot; he remarks cheerfully when she pats his cheeks in satisfaction. &quot;My day just keeps getting better!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You're still too skinny,&quot; Madam Wen tells him. &quot;When will you marry a nice girl who'll fatten you up? A-Qing, you too, you're too too skinny by far. Who is this handsome young man? Are you A-Qing's boyfriend?&quot; She peers up at Lan Zhan, who is probably a full foot and a half taller than she is.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He sure is,&quot; Wen Qing lies through a wide smile. &quot;This is Lan Zhan, Popo. He's in library studies. Are you enjoying the wedding?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Madam Wen scoffs. &quot;The wedding! Hah! What a joke! Neither of those children have spoken to me once. If my brother were still alive he would be ashamed. A-Ying, be a good boy and make your Popo a hot water.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma'am,&quot; Wei Ying says, and puts the kettle on.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Madam Wen squints at Lan Zhan. &quot;Young man, do you speak Mandarin?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Lan Zhan replies. &quot;I grew up in Shanghai.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Shanghai! What are they teaching young people in Shanghai these days? Ice water! Pah! You'll fill up with phlegm!&quot; She pokes his belly, which is approximately the level of her shoulders. &quot;A-Ying, give this boy some hot water, you're poisoning him.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying meets Lan Zhan's eyes and shrugs cheerfully. &quot;Gotta do what Popo tells me,&quot; he says, and pours two steaming bowls of hot water. When he hands the second bowl to Lan Zhan, their fingers brush. &quot;This Wei Ying apologizes for poisoning Wen Qing's dashing young man.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lan Zhan hums. He maintains eye contact as he tips the water into his mouth. Wen Qing says in English, &quot;Oh my god.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying has no idea what she's talking about.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Madam Wen dodders away eventually, possibly back to the ladies' room to avoid having to congratulate her utter disappointment of a great-nephew on his wedding, but Wen Qing and Lan Zhan continue to loiter around the bar for the rest of the evening. Wei Ying is absolutely fucking delighted to realize that actually Wen Chao seems to be a little afraid of Lan Zhan or Wen Qing or both, a fact which becomes clear when Wei Ying and Luo Mian watch him tip his empty glass upside-down into his mouth, slide a longing glance over to the bar, and then turn hastily away on four separate occasions.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Wei Ying says the fourth time it happens. &quot;This is great, actually. This wedding rocks. Which one of you is he afraid of, do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably both of us,&quot; Wen Qing says, &quot;but especially Lan Zhan. He knows I can't kick his ass in the presence of my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying raises his eyebrows. &quot;And Lan Zhan can?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I would not,&quot; Lan Zhan says, which is a bummer. But then, after a slight pause, he adds, &quot;He doesn't need to know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Lan Zhan, you sly fox,&quot; Wei Ying says admiringly. &quot;What on earth have you done to him?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He is quick to anger, quick to fight, and quick to lose,&quot; Lan Zhan says, which is code for, <br />
<br />
I beat his ass.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;He's decided it is easier to pretend that I am particularly intimidating than to acknowledge that he is particularly pathetic.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He's being humble,&quot; Wen Qing tells Wei Ying. &quot;Lan Zhan teaches Chen tai chi. He knows how to throw a punch.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; Wei Ying says, looking at the ceiling and thinking about biceps. &quot;Great. Awesome. I love that for you, Lan Zhan.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's traditional,&quot; Lan Zhan says, &quot;and I wouldn't fight for no reason,&quot; as if he maybe thinks it was disapproval that caught in Wei Ying's throat instead of pure gay energy.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Believe me, I trust you had reason,&quot; Wei Ying reassures him. &quot;He went to our high school too.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm,&quot; Lan Zhan says, his eyes narrowed in a delicate grimace. &quot;My condolences.&quot; Wei Ying snorts, delighted.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember how I told you about the kid who punched Wen Chao on behalf of A-Ning?&quot; Wen Qing says to Lan Zhan. &quot;That was Wei Ying.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I broke my thumb,&quot; Wei Ying says mournfully. Then, less mournfully, &quot;And his nose. Now I can write with my left hand too and he's got ten thousand dollars of plastic in his face.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;How are either of you even here??&quot; Luo Mian wonders.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure Wen Chao remembers who exactly I am,&quot; Wei Ying admits. &quot;Since apparently getting punched out by hot people is a frequent occurrence for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The wedding invitation said I could bring a plus-one and no one ever asked who I was going to bring,&quot; Wen Qing says. &quot;I was prepared to lie if they did, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it,&quot; Luo Mian says.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to learn how to throw a punch without breaking your thumb?&quot; Lan Zhan asks.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying learned how to throw a proper punch shortly after the thumb break incident, and has punched more than one person since then without disaster. He's dabbled in bagua zhang and a couple different schools of kung fu and even American kickboxing. He knows how to throw a punch.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; he says, offering his hand across the bar. He can see Luo Mian and Wen Qing rolling their eyes at each other out of the corner of his eye, but Lan Zhan is a good sport, so he takes Wei Ying's hand and curls it into a fist.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Your thumb goes outside your fingers,&quot; Lan Zhan tells him seriously. He holds Wei Ying's fist in his hand and brushes his fingers along the back of it. &quot;Align your hand and forearm so that the line from your knuckles to your elbow is straight. Like this the force from the punch travels up your arm.&quot; He gestures with his hand up Wei Ying's forearm, all the way up to the crumple of his rolled-up sleeve at his elbow.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying's mouth is pretty dry just about now.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to start with correct posture,&quot; Lan Zhan continues. &quot;Feet apart. Your body should be at an angle to your opponent.&quot; He reaches across the bar and taps two fingers against Wei Ying's left shoulder. &quot;Your right hand is dominant, so your left shoulder faces me.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying shifts to obey. &quot;You're my opponent now?&quot; he asks.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;For the purposes of this exercise,&quot; Lan Zhan says, stepping to one side to mirror Wei Ying's posture.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you could teach him even better if you were standing behind him,&quot; says Luo Mian, who is a bro.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; says Wen Qing, who is not a bro. &quot;Lan Zhan, he's fucking with you, Wei Ying knows how to throw a punch.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lan Zhan looks to him for confirmation, and Wei Ying kind of smiles guiltily and gives Lan Zhan's shoulder a gentle tap with a perfectly-formed fist. &quot;I thought I'd touch up on my skills,&quot; he says, instead of <br />
<br />
I thought you might hold my hand a little.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Lan Zhan says flatly. His face, which is already not particularly expressive, has gone even more blank than it has been. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh,&quot; Wei Ying says, feeling his heart fall. &quot;I wasn't -- I'm not making fun of you,&quot; he says. &quot;I was just... playing around. I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man. You want another drink?&quot; Luo Mian asks Wen Qing.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, please. This is painful,&quot; Wen Qing says.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
All at once Wei Ying runs out of patience with himself. &quot;This is <br />
<br />
stupid,&quot; <br />
<br />
he decides. &quot;Oh my god. I'm really not getting any younger. Lan Zhan, I wasn't making fun of you and I wasn't really playing around either. I was flirting with you. Is that okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lan Zhan blinks. His expression hardly changes at all, but his ears get steadily pinker. &quot;... Yes,&quot; he says at last, after waiting just long enough to make Wei Ying start to sweat. &quot;You can flirt with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; Wei Ying says, feeling suddenly breathless. &quot;Great. I like -- hey, do you want to dance with me?&quot; He gestures at the dance floor, which is notably free of the horrible happy couple and populated mostly by various uncles and aunts instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lan Zhan looks at him seriously. Then he nods. Wei Ying blinks. &quot;What, really?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Mn,&quot; Lan Zhan says. &quot;I'll dance with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying laughs nervously. &quot;Even though you're here as Wen Qing's beard?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lan Zhan casts a thoughtful look around. &quot;I believe those who would care are either drunk or gone for the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Go for it, boys,&quot; Wen Qing says. &quot;You have my blessing.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We barely even needed two bartenders to begin with,&quot; Luo Mian agrees.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, yeah,&quot; Wei Ying says. &quot;Um, here's the stupid part. Do you even know how to dance like that? Because I don't.&quot; He and Jiang Cheng did both dragon and lion dancing as high schoolers; Wei Ying was the pearl in dragon dancing and the butt end of the lion. He's pretty sure the only friend he has who might really know how to slow dance in the European style is Nie Huaisang, and that's a big <br />
<br />
maybe.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not,&quot; Lan Zhan admits. Then, with a look out at the crowd, he remarks, &quot;It seems to involve mostly swaying in time. I think we can manage that.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
He's right; most of the people here are just stepping or swaying from side to side, their hands clasped at shoulder height or looped around each other's bodies. There's a live string quartet (!) playing something slow and unfamiliar.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, Wei Ying could do that. He could do that with Lan Zhan. He clears his throat. &quot;Um, let me put my apron up.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lan Zhan waits patiently as he ducks out of the apron and folds it on a stool, then wriggles out from behind the bar. &quot;You don't have to,&quot; Wei Ying tells him, just in case. &quot;I didn't really --&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you joking, when you asked?&quot; Lan Zhan interrupts.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying looks at him. He looks handsome and serious and a little nervous. &quot;No,&quot; he says. &quot;No, I wasn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lan Zhan offers his hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying takes it and lets himself be led a little way away from the bar. The gold-draped tables are still scattered between them and the rest of the dance floor when Lan Zhan stops and steps closer. Wei Ying drifts in towards him. &quot;Not dancing with everyone else?&quot; he wonders.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not everyone else,&quot; Lan Zhan tells him.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying laughs incredulously, his heart a nervous bird in his chest. &quot;Alright,&quot; he agrees.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lan Zhan considers their clasped hands, then releases his hold on Wei Ying in favor of doing hoverhands over his waist. &quot;May I --&quot; he begins, and Wei Ying puts his own hands firmly over Lan Zhan's so that he's solidly held.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Wei Ying says belatedly. Wow, Lan Zhan's hands are warm, even through his dress shirt. Wei Ying releases him and slings his hands up to loop his arms around Lan Zhan's neck, and it brings their faces close together. Wei Ying couldn't quite tell from behind the bar, but they're almost the same height; Lan Zhan is maybe an inch or two taller than him, and a little wider. He's so fucking pretty, and this close he smells like some sort of dizzyingly sexy expensive cologne. They sway into each other, find the beat of the music. Wei Ying likes that Lan Zhan knows how to fight. That he teaches kids how to fight, teaches friendly strangers at awful weddings. That he drinks plain ice water except when someone else's granny orders him to drink hot water instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying tilts his head down to rest his temple against Lan Zhan's shoulder. Lan Zhan makes a sound like, &quot;Mmh,&quot; and pulls him a little closer.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You're cute,&quot; Wei Ying tells his throat. &quot;I don't usually do this.&quot; Which isn't precisely true: he flirts all the time, and sometimes he even gets somewhere with it. But he's never really meant it. Something about Lan Zhan makes him want to mean it.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't either,&quot; Lan Zhan says. Wei Ying takes the liberty of pulling himself closer, this time, until their chests are pressed together. He can feel Lan Zhan's heart pounding against him. Lan Zhan squeezes his waist, slides his hands in to lie flat over Wei Ying's spine. One of their friends wolf-whistles. &quot;Is this okay?&quot; Lan Zhan asks, his voice quiet over Wei Ying's ear.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying laughs shakily. &quot;Uh, yeah. I think you could do just about anything and it would be okay, frankly.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmh,&quot; Lan Zhan says again, and brushes his mouth over Wei Ying's ear.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; Wei Ying mutters. &quot;Okay, um, maybe not that. Or anything else that's gonna make me have to hide my boner when we go back. But, like, anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Noted,&quot; Lan Zhan says, sounding a little strangled.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Wei Ying says. &quot;I'm too into you to know how to be subtle right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No apologies necessary,&quot; Lan Zhan tells him graciously. &quot;You don't need to be subtle. It's... a reasonable concern.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying breathes in and lets himself think about that response for approximately half a second before shutting that train of thought right the fuck back down. &quot;Great,&quot; he creaks. &quot;So... Wen Qing said you're in library science?&quot; he asks, instead of, <br />
<br />
What are you doing immediately after this and do you want to come home with me instead?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Mn,&quot; Lan Zhan says, changing tack gracefully. &quot;My goal is to be an archivist. So much of our history is so easily lost; I'd like to help recover it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Which 'our' is that?&quot; Wei Ying asks.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone,&quot; Lan Zhan says. &quot;Everyone. I have specific interests. But all paper burns.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;... Wow,&quot; Wei Ying says. &quot;I mean, yeah. That's intense. That's really cool, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so,&quot; Lan Zhan agrees, then prompts, &quot;You said you take notes.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah. I'm not in school for anything, I just do citizen science. Like, bartender by night, guy who goes out to the sticks and counts bugs by day, sort of thing,&quot; Wei Ying says. &quot;Sometimes I see a coyote or something and that's cool. It just feels good to be doing something that might actually matter. You'd think it wouldn't -- like, it's just bugs, right -- but any data is good data. Which kinds, how many, that sort of thing. You know we think Western science has only identified a little over half the bugs in the US?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I did not,&quot; Lan Zhan admits.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. Western science has only identified a little over half the bugs in the US, probably,&quot; Wei Ying informs him very seriously. Lan Zhan's mouth ticks up at one corner.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever identified a new species?&quot; he asks.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying blows air out through his lips. &quot;Oh, like, maybe? Probably not? It's hard to tell -- and speciation is, like, looking increasingly fake anyway --&quot; He glances up at Lan Zhan, who looks a little lost. &quot;That's not the sexy answer, is it,&quot; Wei Ying guesses. &quot;I revise: I haven't, but when I do I'll name my new bug species after you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Consider me seduced,&quot; Lan Zhan tells him, and Wei Ying wails and thunks his forehead back into Lan Zhan's shoulder.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
After a moment he says, &quot;Me too. You can consider me seduced too.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm,&quot; Lan Zhan says. &quot;That's good.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Wei Ying breathes, and then, &quot;I think we need to stop talking about seduction or else,&quot; and so for the rest of the piece they stand there quietly leaning into each other, swaying together to the music. When the song ends they pull reluctantly apart, and Wei Ying wants to kiss him, but they're in public and at least in theory Lan Zhan is being discreet here and Wei Ying doesn't want to make it weird. Weirder. He clears his throat and steps away. Boner status: manageable. He says, &quot;I should get back to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Mn,&quot; Lan Zhan agrees, and they return to the bar, where Wen Qing is writing on one of four napkins in front of her.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We're all exchanging numbers,&quot; she informs them as Wei Ying slithers behind the bar and ducks back into his apron. &quot;If you dorks lose track of each other after tonight I will kill you with my hands. Also, Mianmian and I are friends now.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good,&quot; Wei Ying says. Wen Qing hands him a napkin that says LAN ZHAN and then a phone number. Lan Zhan gets a napkin that says WEI YING and LUO MIAN. &quot;There's still hope for our ecosystem,&quot; Wei Ying mumbles, folding his napkin up and putting it in his pocket. Then he reaches over and draws some hearts around his own name and number on Lan Zhan's napkin for good measure, singing absently, &quot;All my friends should be friends with my friends.&quot; Then he folds it up and leans over to tuck it into Lan Zhan's breast pocket.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
When he looks up, Lan Zhan is staring at him. Wei Ying pats his chest once and leans away. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
After a moment Wen Qing clears her throat. &quot;So, we should go,&quot; she says. &quot;We both have work early tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah? You're leaving before the lights turn off? What a betrayal!&quot; Wei Ying cries. &quot;Mianmian and I have to be here till ten.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, kid,&quot; Wen Qing says. &quot;At least you get to sleep in tomorrow.&quot; Wei Ying makes a face like <br />
<br />
Yeah okay.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It was good to meet you,&quot; Lan Zhan says to Luo Mian and Wei Ying.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You too,&quot; Luo Mian says. &quot;Both of you. We'll start a groupchat.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Wei Ying says quickly, &quot;Yeah, we'll text. Like not right now because we're on the job, technically. But later.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lan Zhan nods firmly. &quot;Later,&quot; he agrees.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
And then they say their goodbyes, and then Wen Qing and Lan Zhan retrieve their things from the table where they were sitting, and then they leave. And Luo Mian and Wei Ying just sort of sit there listening to the quartet for a full thirty seconds of loneliness.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
And then Luo Mian says, &quot;What the fuck are you waiting for? Go!&quot; and Wei Ying says &quot;Yep!&quot; and leaps over the bar and dashes out through the lobby into the dark parking lot, where Lan Zhan has just shut the trunk of his car. Wei Ying shouts, &quot;Hey!&quot; and Wen Qing and Lan Zhan both turn, their faces turned orange with black smudges by the outdoor lighting.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Wei Ying,&quot; Lan Zhan says, concerned. &quot;Are you alright? Did we forget --&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying catches him by the lapels of his jacket. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he gasps, &quot;Yeah, you forgot something, oh my god. Can I kiss you?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lan Zhan stares at him. Then he reaches up to cup Wei Ying's face in his hands, and tilts his head a little, and pulls him into a kiss. His mouth is soft and firm and warm, and that faint smell of fine cologne is back.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; Wei Ying mumbles into his mouth. Lan Zhan pulls him closer, lets himself be pressed back against the car. Wei Ying kisses him again, once, twice, manages, &quot;You guys have to go. <br />
<br />
I <br />
<br />
have to go. Text me when you get home --&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Lan Zhan tells him, and kisses him again. Wei Ying whimpers, opens his mouth for Lan Zhan's tongue, sucks on it a little before they both draw back.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wei Ying drops his head to Lan Zhan's shoulder again. Lan Zhan releases his face in favor of holding the back of his head, the nape of his neck. Wei Ying presses into him and says pathetically, &quot;Sorry Wen Qing.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fine,&quot; she says, her voice amused. &quot;Kinda saw this coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Wei Ying says. &quot;I love that. Love that for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You should go,&quot; Lan Zhan tells him quietly. &quot;I'll text.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Wei Ying says, swallowing. He darts in for one last kiss, then pushes himself away. &quot;Yeah. Goodnight, Lan Zhan. Wen Qing.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Night,&quot; Wen Qing says.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight, Wei Ying.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
They climb into the car and pull out. Wei Ying watches the taillights until they're out of view.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The next wedding Wei Ying attends -- well, the next one is another bartending gig. But the one after that is his sister's, and Lan Zhan is his plus-one that time. After that is Luo Mian and her boyfriend, and then Lan Zhan's brother's friend, and then all at once Wen Qing has a <br />
<br />
wife, <br />
<br />
and then --<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;My husband,&quot; Lan Zhan says for the very first time, three years later, and Wei Ying just can't help but to kiss him.<br />

            <td class="column21 style0 s">Toni's  cold.<br />
<br />
It's the kind of cold she hasn't felt since those late nights in the cave with Yinsen.<br />
<br />
Since she stepped through a wormhole and massacred untold thousands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss,&quot; JARVIS's voice is barely a whisper in her ear, more like a quiet sigh in the quickly approaching darkness.<br />
<br />
&quot;J?&quot;  She rasps out, blood thick and foul on her tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Miss,&quot;  JARVIS answers as he always does, &quot;you must stay awake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm  tired,&quot; it comes out as a half sob, pain racking through her chest as she takes in a stuttering breath.  &quot;I'm tired JARVIS.    I'm so tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's true too.<br />
<br />
Toni is tired, tired in a way she hasn't been since Jarvis died.  She feels empty and carved out, hollow inside like she hasn't since she laid him in the ground.<br />
<br />
She's exhausted down to her  bones.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you are Miss,&quot; JARVIS soothes her, voice as gentle as a lullabye.  &quot;But you must stay awake.&quot;<br />
<br />
He doesn't fool her though, not her baby boy.<br />
<br />
Even as exhausted and beaten down as she is Toni can hear the carefully concealed desperation in his tone.<br />
<br />
He's  frightened.<br />
<br />
Like he had been during the creeping death of the palladium.<br />
<br />
During the terror of New York.<br />
<br />
During the horror that was Ultron.<br />
<br />
She's scared her boy, and she's so very sorry for doing this to him yet again.  It seems as if that's all she ever does.  Hurt the ones she loves, one way or another.<br />
<br />
Maybe it'd be best if she just ...<br />
<br />
Toni feels herself begin to drift, feels the way the darkness creeps just a bit closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother!  &quot;  JARVIS' sharp reprimand snaps her back to awareness.  &quot;You must not sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Toni whispers as she forces her eyes open again, blinks past the drip of blood from her scalp that's already begun to dry and the curls that've fallen into her face.  &quot;J, baby,  I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
She coughs, ragged and painfully deep, and her gauntlet comes away from her battered face splattered with blood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, Miss,&quot; JARVIS soothes her again.  &quot;This was all ... you have nothing to apologize for.  You must only stay awake.&quot;<br />
<br />
She grimaces, raises a hand to press uselessly against the pitted front of the armor.<br />
<br />
The armor's shot, the integrity of its casing a thing of the past.  She can't fly out of here.  She can barely move.  She's alone except for JARVIS in her ear and she's losing heat fast.<br />
<br />
She's losing fast.<br />
<br />
Toni breathes as deeply as she can bare at the moment and lets it out in a long, slow, whistling hiss.  Beneath the armor her chest is a mess.  She can feel the steady trickle of blood running down her sides, can feel where pieces of the suit have bent inwards.  Can feel where her ribs don't sit right anymore.<br />
<br />
She'd always known love would wreck her someday.  Had always known that it would be the end of her in one way or another.<br />
<br />
But she'd never thought it would be like this.<br />
<br />
She'd never thought it would be Steve, with Bucky miraculously returned to his side, who would deal the killing blow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure it's gonna matter J.&quot;  Toni tells him ruefully after a long silent moment has passed.  She's slumped against one of the support struts, hidden from the worst of the blasting wind behind her, but the snow is already beginning to pile up a bit at the edges.  &quot;Not sure I got much choice.  You feeling up to telling me Icarus again?  I think ... I'd like to hear it ... just in case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You promised,&quot; JARVIS snaps at her, angry and defiant and as close to desperate as she's ever heard him.  &quot;You promised you would stay with me, that you would not go where I could not follow you.  Not if you could help it.  You can do this Miss, so now I shall hold you to your word.  There will be no stories, no goodbyes.  Not this time.  You will stay awake.  You will hold on until I reach you.  You will live.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm trying, J,&quot; Toni sighs, ragged and painful.  &quot;But we both know how this is gonna end.  Just like last time, we know how this plays out.  Don't think we'll pull another miracle out of the hat for this one, baby boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I launched a suit in your direction as soon as you departed your helicopter in pursuit of Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes, Miss.&quot;  JARVIS tells her.  &quot;I no longer trusted the Captain to have your safety as a primary concern.  I thought one of the repurposed Legionnaires would be a welcomed and hopefully unnecessary addition to your party.  Vision has also been alerted and is in route.  You must simply hold on until they arrive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni swallows down a painful laugh because of course he did.  Her  boy , so smart, so resourceful, so over protective.  But it still might not be enough.<br />
<br />
Her chest aches, pain that she's only really felt a handful of times before arcing through her.  A slow, creeping death.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll try,&quot; Toni tells him again.  It's the best she can offer because this ... this is one thing she can't build her way out of.<br />
<br />
Not now.<br />
<br />
Not this time.<br />
<br />
She's already too far gone for that.<br />
<br />
&quot;It won't be long now,&quot; JARVIS reassures her softly.  &quot;Less than ten minutes.  Then we will bring you home.  Where you belong.  Where you will be  safe.  As you should be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Home.<br />
<br />
The Compound.<br />
<br />
Even the thought of it  aches.<br />
<br />
It isn't her home.<br />
<br />
Not really.<br />
<br />
Not anymore.<br />
<br />
Not since ... well not for a few years now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted us to be a family, all of us.  I wanted us to protect the world together.&quot;  Toni rasps as tears pool in the corners of her eyes.  She doesn't bother to blink them away like she normally does.  There's no one here to see them, there's only JARVIS in her ear.  He'll keep her secrets as he always does.  &quot;I just wanted to keep everyone  safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you did Miss,&quot; JARVIS replies.  &quot;I know.  You did the best you could with what you had.  Please ... you  must  know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was all just a  dream  ,&quot; Toni tells him with a desperate, aching kind of sadness.  &quot;It was a dream and I was stupid enough to think I could be part of it.    I ruin everything I touch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;  JARVIS' voice is hard, almost angry, and there's something like grief hiding there, just beneath the rage.  &quot;You are a light in the darkness Miss.  You must never forget that.  We love you, your family loves you.  We will never leave you.  So you must hold on, for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni slumps down even further.  JARVIS' love, as always, warms her deep inside.  Just like Rhodey's always has.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll wait right here for you,&quot; Toni finally agrees even as her eyes slip shut, tears and blood mixing with the slowly forming ice on her face.  &quot;Ain't got anywhere else to be J.&quot;<br />
<br />
The darkness rises back up again then, clawed fingers extended in her direction.<br />
<br />
Toni tries to fight it, for JARVIS, for Rhodey and the bots, for Pepper and Happy.<br />
<br />
But she's already  so tired.<br />
<br />
The darkness grabs her, pulls her down.<br />
<br />
And in her chest the reactor flickers and fades out like a dying star.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
&quot;I am so sorry,&quot; a familiar voice whispers in her ear but Toni doesn't have the strength to open her eyes.  &quot;Forgive me, Toni.&quot;<br />
<br />
There's the sound of tearing metal and then she's being lifted, the armor falling away around her like water sluicing off of her skin.<br />
<br />
It  hurts , sends sharp knives of pain through her chest and her ribs.<br />
<br />
The ground is hard and cold beneath her back in the next second, the thick arms that had held her now gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must do this,&quot; the voice, accented and so familiar it hurts, tells her softly.  &quot;It is the only way.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are hands on her chest, ripping her blouse open and reaching for the reactor.<br />
<br />
There's a click, a  twist , and Toni feels it being lifted from her chest far too easily.<br />
<br />
There's only two ways to take the reactor out and only two people besides Toni should know either of them.<br />
<br />
JARVIS and Rhodey.<br />
<br />
The voice belongs to neither of them so Toni tries to  fight.<br />
<br />
Tries to marshal her quickly fading strength and stop whoever this is from taking her heart away from her again.<br />
<br />
She manages to pry her eyes open and above her Vision's face hovers, creased uncharacteristically in worry.<br />
<br />
In his hands a fresh reactor shines.<br />
<br />
The relief she feels when he slots it into place is indescribable.<br />
<br />
&quot; V-Vis-ion,&quot; her lips feel chapped and talking is almost beyond her.  She hasn't felt this weak, this  small, since she was a child.<br />
<br />
Back when she used to cower beneath Howard's fists and feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hush,&quot; Vision tells her, sorrow heavy in his tone as he kneels beside her.  &quot;I am here, you are safe now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni shakes her head as best she can, something is wrong, she can tell.  Sorrow is too heavy in Vision's expression, too thick in his voice.<br />
<br />
The ground beneath her is warmer than it was before.<br />
<br />
&quot;This should have never happened.&quot;  Vision says, and it sounds like a declaration of mourning.  &quot;This is a price that should not have been paid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-Rhodey?&quot;  She manages to choke the question out.<br />
<br />
Rhodey had fallen and she'd been too late.<br />
<br />
If it hadn't been for the Spiderling, T'Challa, and Vision working together he would have hit the ground.<br />
<br />
As it was he'd still been hurt.<br />
<br />
He'd been hurt and she'd left him there in that hospital to go after Steve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Colonel Rhodes is fine,&quot; Vision reassures her as he smooths a hand across her forehead.  His touch is gentle, soft, as he sweeps her curls from her face and carefully wipes away a bit of the blood.  &quot;He's unconscious still, there's been some swelling in his spine but the doctors predict a full recovery.  He'll be glad to see you when you return I'm sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni tries to smile, knows her teeth are probably stained red with blood.<br />
<br />
She's not going home, no matter what she'd promised JARVIS.<br />
<br />
They both know that.<br />
<br />
The cold that had been creeping up on her hadn't been just from the snow and the ice.<br />
<br />
Vision shifts then, hands moving out of her sight, but there's a determined set to his face and shoulders that wasn't there before.<br />
<br />
&quot;JARVIS informed me that he had your permission,&quot; he says solemnly moments later.  &quot;And I regret that he is correct and that this is the only way.  But I need you to tell me yes yourself.  I will not take this choice from you.  Too many choices have already been disregarded.&quot;<br />
<br />
In his hand is a large gauge syringe.<br />
<br />
It glows golden in the low light.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must come back to us, Miss,&quot; JARVIS whispers in her ear, voice resolute but still faintly pleading.  &quot;All that matters is that you return.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni coughs, tastes the ever swelling blood in her mouth rise up a bit higher and thicker, and then nods as best she can.<br />
<br />
Toni is a scrap heap, is so much scattered glass.  There's nothing left in her.  All she can do is take the chance she's being presented with and hope it'll be enough.<br />
<br />
Vision smiles, soft and sad, grief heavy in his face.<br />
<br />
He presses the needle against her chest, right beside the reactor and directly over her heart.<br />
<br />
With a swift, sharp jerk he shoves it in deep.<br />
<br />
Toni gasps, arches up into the shock of it, and then falls back down.<br />
<br />
There's a breathless, silent second, and then there is nothing but  pain.<br />
<br />
Toni  screams  as Extremis rushes through her like a fire and burns her away inside.<br />
<br />
Turns her to nothing more than ash and stardust.<br />
<br />
She'll either die in the process or she'll be made anew.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Reforged.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;2 years later <br />
<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
Toni grits her teeth and deliberately keeps her hands loose and open at her sides.  She can't let the anger take her.  Can't let herself loose even a bit of her tightly held control.  Not anymore.  Not with them.<br />
<br />
She won't give any of them the satisfaction and, frankly, she's even more dangerous now that she used to be.<br />
<br />
Which is saying something, all things considered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could kill them,&quot; JARVIS tells her simply, tone even and bland like he's not talking about murder.  He's grown even more vicious in the two years since the so called Civil War.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately that's not an option J,&quot; Toni mutters lowly as she strides through the door and out into the night.  The massive yard around the Compound is dark and quiet.  &quot;Too much paperwork involved.&quot;<br />
<br />
As always, JARVIS had been right by her side through all of it.  Through Rhodey's brief stint in physical therapy, through amending the Accords, through rebuilding the team, through the pain and the nightmares.<br />
<br />
Through the nights where Toni couldn't sleep and the days where she'd longed for rest of a more  permanent  kind.<br />
<br />
JARVIS and Rhodey, Vision and the bots.  Pepper and Happy and even the Spiderling had all been lifelines for her.  Anchoring points to keep her steady as she navigated her way through the destruction the others had left in their wake.<br />
<br />
And now ... now it had all come to fruition.<br />
<br />
The Accords were now much more palatable than they'd once been, Thunder-dick Ross was rotting in a jail cell, and the rogues had been brought back into the fold.<br />
<br />
Toni should have felt satisfied, should have felt accomplished.<br />
<br />
And, in a way, she did.<br />
<br />
But at the same time it felt just like it had back at the beginning.  Back during New York and in the first year or so afterwards when they'd all butted heads.  When she'd been a puzzle piece that didn't fit correctly, a loose screw that refused to tighten.<br />
<br />
Only now there was none of the hope she'd held onto even then, none of the desire to build a team and a family with the others.  None of the warmth that had eventually grown between them only to be snuffed out bit by bit each time none of them believed her about what she saw through that wormhole.<br />
<br />
After Ultron.<br />
<br />
After Wanda had ...<br />
<br />
After the others hadn't ...<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Well. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now there is only the lingering ache of betrayal.<br />
<br />
And the memory of bleeding out in Vision's arms on the concrete floor of an abandoned HYDRA base.<br />
<br />
&quot;I  would  kill them for this, for the pain they have cause you and our family, if you ask it of me.&quot;  JARVIS presses stubbornly.  &quot;I could do it even if you didn't.  If you would prefer to not be ...  involved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your new and aggressive bent towards supervillainy is both terrifying and adorable.  I feel like it should worry me but, honestly, I'm kind of proud.&quot;  Toni bites back the smile that tries to creep its way across her mouth.  &quot;Follow your dreams J,&quot; Toni pauses, considers for a moment, &quot;unless it's murder.  As a superhero I'm generally required to discourage murder.  No matter how irritating you might find someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Their ungracious attitudes try not only my patience but that of Colonel Rhodes and Vision as well.&quot;  JARVIS snipes back tartly.  &quot;If I am to be named a supervillain rest assured I would not be alone in my newfound profession.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Toni grins outright, unable to help herself.  &quot;If all else I'm pretty sure Butterfingers would follow you.  Out of solidarity if for no other reason.  Though I'm pretty sure evil mastermind has been his dream job for years now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For once I find Butterfinger's propensity for violence to be rather refreshing.&quot;  JARVIS says.  &quot;In fact I find it to be rather worthy of encouragement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If he keeps on with that blowtorch either he's going to burn the Compound down or DUM-E's going to have an actual stroke.&quot;  Toni tells him flatly but still amused.<br />
<br />
It's true too.  DUM-E constantly has his fire-extinguisher on hand now-days because Butterfingers has been brandishing a blowtorch at anyone who came down to the workshop who wasn't Rhodey, Vision, or the Spider-baby for the past six months.  He is, surprisingly, tolerant of Bu- Barnes  after JARVIS had apparently had a word with him on Toni's behalf but everyone else is fair game.<br />
<br />
Fair game since JARVIS doesn't seem inclined to protect them any more than Toni herself does these days.<br />
<br />
Rhodey seems to find the entire thing hysterical and she's pretty sure he's the one who keeps replacing the butane tanks every time they run out.  It seems like the sort of petty thing he'd do, glorious asshole of a man that he is.<br />
<br />
Granted it could have been Vision considering the fact that he's somehow become just as petty as the rest of her small family over the past two years.  JARVIS and Rhodey have been a horrible/wonderful influence on him apparently.<br />
<br />
U has, as always, been the calmest of the lot but he doesn't have Toni fooled for a second.  She knows he's the one who keeps tying trip wires at about neck height for both Barton and Rogers.  Rhodey's learned to duck as he comes into the workshop now and Vision just phases through the nearest wall.<br />
<br />
She's also sure the Spider-tot is the one who keeps giving him the wire to do it with too.<br />
<br />
All of that aside someone keeps giving Butterfinger's murderous ass fresh fuel for the damn blowtorch.  Toni's already had to replace the couch twice and one of the tall ferns in Mother's terrarium.<br />
<br />
She's not going to take it away from him of course but that's hardly the point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's take a break for a bit baby boy.&quot;  Toni pipes up after a moment of silence.  &quot;I'm feeling like a bit of a change of scenery.  How about me and you go for a fly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am, as always, here with you Miss.&quot;  JARVIS agrees.  He likes it when she leaves the Compound these days, has even been not so subtly hinting at them either moving back to the Tower permanently or perhaps even back to Malibu.<br />
<br />
Toni smiles, warm at heart with the love she has for him, and calls the armor up from within her.<br />
<br />
It folds around her smoothly, slides across her skin like silk.<br />
<br />
Extremis had, luckily for her, been so very kind to her in more than one respect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go J,&quot; Toni takes a step forward and kicks off of the ground in a deliberately showy move of still new strength.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wherever you wish to go I will always follow.&quot;  JARVIS reminds her, a promise he'd given her after New York when the terror of being separated by the worm hole had been fresh for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't have it any other way.&quot;  And she wouldn't either.<br />
<br />
He's her  son  and she loves him so.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
Toni flies aimlessly for awhile, mind drifting in the peace and quiet she only finds in the armor these days.  The safety that only JARVIS in her ear or Rhodey at her side or Vision at her back has been able to give her for what seems like forever now.<br />
<br />
She finally settles down on a cliff side somewhere on the coast, far out from any kind of town or city.  There are no lights and the stars are so bright they take her breath away for a long moment as she lets the armor slip back beneath her skin.<br />
<br />
It's one part awe and two parts terror to be honest.<br />
<br />
Terror because she  knows  what's out there and no one outside of a select few seem to want to believe her.<br />
<br />
So, fuck it.  She'll just have to do whatever she can, whatever she has to do, to keep the world safe with what help she has.<br />
<br />
It's one of the reasons she'd supported efforts to push the other's pardons through.<br />
<br />
Because they might have abandoned her but Toni won't, can't, abandon the world.<br />
<br />
No matter what it costs her.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss,&quot; she's standing on the cliff side still, head tilted back to the stars and mind whirling, when JARVIS pipes up in her ear an hour or so later.  &quot;One of our satellites picked up an unusual reading a few moments ago.  A large, unidentified craft has entered Earth's airspace but seemed to disappear only moments later.  What information I gathered says that it does not match any of the scans we took of the Chitauri, or even Prince Thor, but it has entered our atmosphere nonetheless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni goes tense and the armor comes to her half thought call with barely any hesitation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where?&quot;  She barks the question out.  &quot;Give me a possible trajectory J.  Did it emit any kind of traceable signal?  Fuck it, I'll check myself.  You call Rhodey, get him and the others mobilized.  We're not going to be caught off guard here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni turns her attention inwards and unleashes the tightly held control she normally keeps on Extremis, lets it branch out and speed across her connection to J and out towards the data JARVIS had told her about.<br />
<br />
It takes her only a few seconds to pinpoint what he was talking about.<br />
<br />
There.<br />
<br />
A mid-sized craft, large by Earth standards of course, but also traveling alone.  It had flickered across the sensors of the latest upgraded satellite Toni had funded and put into orbit for just this reason for a split second and then it was  gone.<br />
<br />
Only a slight heat and radiation trail was left in its wake.  It would have been untraceable for anyone else who looked for it.<br />
<br />
Luckily Toni's always been a cut above the rest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Colonel Rhodes' is aware and he and Vision are mobilizing the others Miss.&quot;  JARVIS chimes in down her line.  &quot;Full assembly in less than three minutes.  Arrival to your destination in under ten.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni's attention sharpens as she traces the trajectory and she feels her mind go smooth as she settles into battle mode.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not gonna have ten minutes J,&quot; she finally murmurs as she comes back to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss?&quot;  JARVIS sounds almost worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got a feeling whoever this is has got a specific goal in mind,&quot; Toni says, deliberately overloud even as her spine stiffens.<br />
<br />
Above her a spotlight abruptly turns on and the clearing is flooded with light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; a gruff voice calls out from far too close, &quot;you ain't wrong about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni forces herself to remain calm as she prepares herself to face this new player in the game.  Whoever they were they'd made a beeline straight for her location once they'd entered Earth's atmosphere so obviously she's a part of whatever it is they're doing.  And they'd gotten so close to her without either her or JARVIS picking up on them until she'd manually traced the ship's trajectory.<br />
<br />
Their ship's cloaking device had been able to fool her sensors.  They'd beaten her tech.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Her tech.<br />
<br />
Beaten it.<br />
<br />
With apparently  superior stealth tech.<br />
<br />
It was something that had never happened to Toni before and it made her want to curse, low and mean, and possibly  scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make a note J,&quot; Toni mutters as she turns, &quot;we've got some upgrading to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please do focus on the possible alien menace Miss,&quot; JARVIS snips back.  &quot;Vision has left ahead and is less than six minutes out.  Colonel Rhodes is with him and the others will be following in the quinjet.&quot;<br />
<br />
She takes in his words, slots them away, and focuses on the here and now.  Beneath the faceplate Toni feels her brows arch high in surprise.<br />
<br />
The alien is, by Earth standards at least, seemingly male.<br />
<br />
He's also fucking blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there Papa Smurf,&quot; Toni calls out with deliberate ease in her tone.  &quot;Fancy meeting you here.  You got business with me specifically or did you stop by to see how the smurfberries were coming along?&quot;<br />
<br />
To her surprise the alien, guy?, smurf?, she honestly doesn't know and probably shouldn't care  at this point, throws his head back and laughs, the strange red  fin  on his scalp glinting in the bright lights of the ship that hovers above them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're  perfect,&quot; he crows loudly, hands braced on his hips.  &quot;Better than I'd hoped you'd be.  Kraglin's gonna owe me units after this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Toni drawls, &quot;I certainly think so but popular opinion might not flow so smooth with that outlook.&quot;  Toni waits a beat.  &quot;You got a name Blue Wonder?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yondu,&quot; blue guy tells her, chest puffed out just a bit, &quot;Yondu Udonta.  Ravager.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Toni Stark,&quot; Toni dips her head in a small nod, every sense alert and armor primed and ready because on one hand she doesn't know or trust this alien and on the other she's not looking to start an intergalactic incident by attacking first like some people would.  &quot;Iron Queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unless she has to of course.<br />
<br />
Then all bets are off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I know who you are,&quot; Yondu unexpectedly nods as he tucks his hands against his belt, long red leather coat pushed back off of his hips.  &quot;Done heard all about you.  Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's ... kind of unsettling to be honest.&quot;  Toni blinks in slight surprise.  &quot;Also kind of surprising.  And I'm used to being famous so that's saying a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got a whole galaxy of folk up there chatting bout you,&quot; Yondu nods.  &quot;Figured that make you perfect for what I got in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni feels unease slither down her spine at the intent look on Yondu's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what,&quot; she asks slowly as she primes the repulsors and readies herself to move, &quot;would that be exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never thought I'd come after another mouthy Terran,&quot; Yondu grins, crooked teeth unabashedly bared and seemingly unconcerned, &quot;but my boy ... well he deserves the best.  Figured I'd make up for threatenin' to eat him all those years.  Might stop him from being so pissy all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's real sweet and all,&quot; Toni cuts in sharply as understanding dawns on her, &quot;but I doubt he's my type.  And it's not the blue thing either, because that could be hot.  It's more along the lines of the whole  I'm not leaving with you thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well see, that's where you're wrong,&quot; Yondu smirks and abruptly whistles.  Toni's startled for a split second by the arrow that darts towards her from where it had been sheathed at his waist.  The fin on his head glows a threatening red.<br />
<br />
Toni twirls, blasts at it with the repulsor and grits her teeth when she misses.  The thing's too fucking fast even if he is controlling it by  goddamn whistling  apparently.<br />
<br />
She arms a set of the shoulder rockets, turns to take aim at Yondu himself, and bites back a scream as agony lights up her senses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss!&quot; JARVIS' voice is staticy but still in her ear as she clenches her teeth against the pain.<br />
<br />
The armor, unbelievably, slumps around her and Toni's vision wavers as she slumps to the ground.  The suit melts back into her bones as it always does when it's too damaged to function and needs to be repaired.<br />
<br />
Toni's left vulnerable, splayed out on the ground and paralyzed.<br />
<br />
This, none of this, should be possible.   The armor is insulated.  She'd made sure of it after Vanko and again after one too many training sessions with a thunder happy Thor.  Electricity shouldn't touch her like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, Kraglin, you didn't kill her did ya?&quot;  Yondu demands as he moves forward to hover over her.  To her surprise there's concern in his expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah Captain,&quot; another, unfamiliar voice, apparently Kraglin, chimes in.  &quot;Just shocked her a bit, should be safe enough.  Least ways that's what Rocket said.&quot;<br />
<br />
There's a second, surprisingly human looking face hovering over her then.  Kraglin's scruffy looking, lean and rangy, and he's wearing a red leather coat just like Yondu.<br />
<br />
In one of his hands is some kind of gun Toni doesn't recognize and in the other is a thick black band that looks an awful lot like a collar of some kind.  Dred pools deep and heavy in her stomach.<br />
<br />
Toni's body is frozen as Kraglin leans down and clicks the collar around her throat.  Immediately she feels trapped, feels like she's been cut off from something greater.  She tries to call for the armor, damaged as it is, but the signal buts up against some kind of wall and refuses to move outwards.  Same thing when she reaches out desperately towards where the quinjet should be rapidly approaching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on Miss,&quot; JARVIS is openly desperate but still in her ear even with the slight static on her ear piece.  Apparently the collar works only on her and has left the separate channel her earpiece functions on alone.  &quot;The others are almost there.  Wait for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni already knows they're not going to make it in time.  There's too much distance and Yondu's ship is too advanced.  She'll have to fix that when she gets out of this mess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't know what she can do but that suppression collar should keep her calm for a bit.  Plus we've got incoming Captain,&quot; Kraglin speaks up suddenly, attention focused on some kind of tech attached to his arm.  &quot;Looks like she's got friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah  hell  Kraglin we knew that when we came,&quot; Yondu sucks on his teeth.  &quot;Don't matter none, so let's get going.  Supposed to be meeting up with the others soon anyways.  Ain't really in no mood to fight no Terrans right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think he's gonna like her?&quot;  Kraglin asks as Yondu bends down and scoops Toni into his arms with surprising gentleness.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's a pretty little thing,&quot; Yondu winks down at her as he moves towards the hovering ship and the rapidly descending freight carrier.  &quot;A queen too from what she said.  Makes sense I guess.  Figured she'd be a good match for 'em either way.  Him being  Star Lord  and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ain't you worried bout her people coming for her?&quot;  Kraglin doesn't sound that concerned despite the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell no,&quot; Yondu scoffs.  &quot;Terran's ain't out in space with the rest of the galaxy yet.  Plus, way I hear tell this one right here's the only one we'd really have to worry about anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still not sure if he's gonna like this Captain,&quot; Kraglin sounds uncertain then, &quot;us stealin her like this.  Don't even wanna think bout what some of the others are gonna say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They'll come around,&quot; Yondu sounds certain.  &quot;Plus ain't like we hurt her none, not really.  She ain't no kid and we ain't taking her to slave.  Ain't broke no rules, Ravager or Guardian.  Just ... thinking outside the box a bit.  He's done sulked enough.  A wife might cheer him up a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so Captain,&quot; Kraglin finally relents.<br />
<br />
Toni is dazed but still understands what's going on around her even if she can't do anything about it at the moment.<br />
<br />
But that won't last forever.<br />
<br />
They'll make a mistake, Yondu and Kraglin or this bastard Star Lord they're taking her to.<br />
<br />
And once they do they'll figure out why, exactly, it's a  terrible  idea to kidnap Toni Stark.<br />
<br />
You guys are so sweet to me. So here's the next part and I hope you like it!!<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss,&quot; JARVIS' voice is faint, still almost a whisper thanks to that electrical charge that Kraglin had shot her up with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; Toni hums lowly, all too aware that she's still in Yondu's arms even though they've made it inside the ship and Kraglin's settled in what looks like a pilot's chair.<br />
<br />
She feels it when they take off, feels the change in pressure and the way the air in the ship seems to shift.<br />
<br />
She grits her teeth against the need to scream because  they're taking her.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;They're taking her away from her family. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yondu turns and carries her away from the cockpit, presumably to take her wherever it is he plans to stash her for the time being.<br />
<br />
Toni tracks her eyes across everything she can see as he moves.  A part of her mind is already  whirling over what she can see of the consoles, over the possible composition of the metals and materials that make up the ship.  Over the possible power source and energy outputs.<br />
<br />
Speed, maneuverability, durability.<br />
<br />
A million and one things that, under different circumstances, would fascinate her.  Things she would have given a lot to have the opportunity to study.<br />
<br />
Now she's just trying to decide which part of what she wants to rig to  explode.<br />
<br />
&quot;You get some rest Missy,&quot; Yondu says with a quirk of a smile as he lays her down on a surprisingly comfortable cot inside of a surprisingly cluttered room.  &quot;Should take a bit for that stun you took to wear off.  Gonna be sore as all hell when you wake up I expect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni manages to bear her teeth in a smile that's more snarl than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cute,&quot; Yondu quips with another grin as he moves away from her and back towards the door.  &quot;You gonna fit right in.&quot;<br />
<br />
He flashes her a jovial wave, slaps a hand against the console by the door, and walks out whistling, door shutting firmly behind him with a muffled clink.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Asshole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Update me J,&quot; Toni gathers the strength to mutter lowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;The quinjet is not fast enough.&quot;  JARVIS pipes up at once.  &quot;Neither is Vision nor Colonel Rhodes.  You have already breached Earth's atmosphere and only Vision is fit for space travel,&quot; JARVIS sounds both desperate and angry.  &quot;By my calculations you'll be out of range of our satellites soon.  There's no way to tell if Extremis will be able to compensate enough to keep us from being disconnected across the vastness of space, especially with that collar on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni breathes out a hiss of frustration.<br />
<br />
Fucking smurf bastard.<br />
<br />
Fucking kidnapping asshole.<br />
<br />
Fucking  space.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got any bright ideas baby boy?&quot;  Toni asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just the one Miss,&quot; JARVIS hesitates for a split second.  &quot;I could do an emergency upload.  Extremis might not be able to reach outside your body ... but I believe I could reach out to you instead.  But I suspect that it is going to  hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
His understanding of pain has also grown over the years and Toni is torn between being proud of his growth and hating the fact that it's been necessary.<br />
<br />
Still, last time she'd heard this kind of hesitation had been when Vision had loaded her full of Extremis on the floor of that bunker.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can take it,&quot; Toni rasps decisively after a second.<br />
<br />
She can.<br />
<br />
She  will.<br />
<br />
Especially if it means there's a chance she can keep JARVIS in her ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you can, Miss,&quot; JARVIS sounds sad.  &quot;Now, we must hurry, there isn't much time.  Brace yourself, uploading in three, two, one.&quot;<br />
<br />
It  hurts.<br />
<br />
There's no denying that.<br />
<br />
It's like someone split her skull open and poured liquid fire into the cavity.<br />
<br />
But Toni's lived through open heart surgery in a cave, </td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">Harry had been certain that things would go poorly from the very instant he found out that Draco Malfoy would be his partner for the next six weeks, because when had anything involving him and Malfoy ever gone well?<br />
<br />
But even knowing that from the very beginning, when he later looked back on all of this, he would still find himself surprised--and vaguely impressed--that he and Malfoy had somehow managed to make a total cock-up of it within the first twenty minutes.<br />
<br />
It was even more impressive when he took into consideration that their assignment wasn't supposed to be at all dangerous. By now, six months into their training, The Magical Law Enforcement Patrol had begun shunting over some of their least perilous assignments so that the Auror trainees could go out and get a little bit of practical experience to go along with the endless heaps of coursework they were assigned. Harry had been looking forward to this for months, and he and Ron exchanged eager grins at the thought of finally getting out of the classroom and into the field.<br />
<br />
But Harry's excitement rapidly collapsed into limp resignation when the instructor announced that instead of being allowed to choose their own partners, as they'd been previously allowed to do for classwork and training assignments, they were to be put in pairs alphabetically. Ron gave Harry a pitying look at that, because their class of trainees was fairly small, and that meant that no one came between Malfoy and Potter. And while they'd all mostly put their differences aside and did their best to put the past behind them, they still didn't particularly like each other. It was only the smallest consolation that Malfoy didn't look any more pleased about their assignment than Harry felt.<br />
<br />
And so now here was Harry, trapped with Malfoy in a cramped evidence room, sorting through a trunk full of magical miscellanea that had somehow ended up in a Muggle charity shop. Two more trunks sat stacked in the corner, and Harry's afternoon stretched interminably before him. Sighing, he set aside the hand mirror he held, and dutifully marked it down on the inventory sheet.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all junk,&quot; Malfoy complained, pulling out a handful of photographs. The people in them--at a wedding, judging from the young witch's elaborate white robes--waved and smiled. Malfoy tossed them carelessly into a nearby evidence box, then reached for his quill and added the photographs to the list of inventory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it's obviously wizarding junk,&quot; Harry told him evenly. It helped a little that Malfoy had so far only complained about the job and not about Harry himself, but the constant griping was still beginning to wear on Harry's patience.<br />
<br />
He pulled out a small brass music box that, when opened, played a tinkling rendition of 'You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.' That might make a good Christmas gift for Molly, Harry thought as he shut the music box and put it in with the other things they'd already looked through. She loved Celestina Warbeck. He'd have to see if he could find one of those that wasn't evidence in an active investigation.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what?&quot; Malfoy said sulkily, sifting through the trunk and coming up with a huge floppy-brimmed hat trimmed with blue silk ribbon rosettes and taxidermied puffskeins. He held it out consideringly, and for one wild moment, Harry thought he was about to try it on. &quot;It's not as if Muggles will be able to tell the difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Malfoy,&quot; Harry sighed. &quot;You are holding a hat decorated with actual magical creatures. Right in your hands. I'm sure that Muggles would be able to figure out that puffskeins are a sort of animal they've never seen before. They'd be falling all over themselves to discover a new species, and the absolute last thing we need is an uproar in the scientific community.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There would be no such thing,&quot; Malfoy said as he crammed the hat into the box with the photographs, shoving down hard to make it fit. He folded the box flaps down and sealed them with a spell. &quot;They're all willfully ignorant. Muggles don't believe in anything that doesn't fit with their astoundingly narrow little world view.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Know that many Muggles, do you?&quot; Harry asked, resisting the urge to roll his eyes. He handed over the inventory sheet and Malfoy slapped it on top, affixed it with a Sticking Charm, and covered it with another charm to protect it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't need to know them,&quot; Malfoy said loftily. A swish of his wand sent the evidence box to the far corner with the rest of the boxes they'd filled so far. &quot;Everybody knows how Muggles are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry bit his tongue as he looked into the bottom of the trunk while Malfoy got a new evidence box and a blank inventory sheet. Continuing this ridiculous argument wouldn't do either of them any favors, and the afternoon would go faster if they kept working and didn't allow themselves to become distracted by bickering with each other.<br />
<br />
They were nearly halfway through this trunk, and that hadn't taken long at all. There were two more trunks so they could be done in about another hour. Then all they had to do was take the boxes and empty trunks down to Evidence, submit their inventory lists to the Patrolmen who were investigating where these magical items had come from, and then they'd be done. Harry could put up with Malfoy for that much longer. They'd be finished before he knew it.<br />
<br />
Willfully ignoring that tomorrow he'd have to come back and face another full day of Malfoy, Harry bit back a sigh and took out a silver compact with a cabbage rose etched into the top. He just had to get through this afternoon. Small goals. Reasonable goals. He could do this.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look lovely, dear!&quot; trilled the little round mirror inside when Harry flipped the lid open, and Malfoy snorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's obviously defective,&quot; he said. &quot;Make sure you note that in the inventory, will you? Enchanted mirror can't tell the difference between an attractive person and a speccy git. Maybe you ought to give it your glasses.&quot;<br />
<br />
And, wonderful. They'd now moved on to personal insults.<br />
<br />
Harry resisted the urge to throw the compact right at Malfoy's head. Instead, he snapped it shut and dropped it in the evidence box. He very deliberately ignored Malfoy and reached down into the trunk for a length of braided silk cord that he saw sticking out of the rest of the junk, preparing to pull it loose, and didn't realize that Malfoy had grabbed the other end of it until a sudden crackle of magic flared to life between them, and the cords glowed gold and wrapped themselves around Harry's and Malfoy's wrists.<br />
<br />
Harry jerked back in surprised, wrenching his arm free. The glow faded and the cords slipped from around Malfoy's wrist and fell limply to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck was that?&quot; Harry asked, looking from the cords to Malfoy's face, and his heart sank like a pebble tossed into a pool. If the stricken expression on Malfoy's face was anything to go by, then whatever had just happened was very bad indeed. &quot;Malfoy?&quot; he asked, rubbing idly at his wrist where a lingering trace of magic made his skin tingle. &quot;What just happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would appear that those are handfasting cords,&quot; Malfoy said shakily, pushing up his sleeve. And there, around his right wrist, was a dark brown mark like a coiled rope. &quot;And we've just bonded ourselves to each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alarmed, Harry pushed up his own sleeve and found the same mark on his own wrist. He rubbed at it. &quot;We're bonded?&quot; he blurted out, panic rising.<br />
<br />
Malfoy cast a slew of spells at himself and Harry, and whatever he saw in the results made him sag in relief. &quot;Temporarily,&quot; he said. &quot;It's only temporary. It appears to be a type of spell that's sometimes used in political marriages, or to marriages arranged to solidify relations between two families. It encourages the newlyweds to spend time together. You know, really make a go of it. Typically, the spell will only last about a month.&quot;<br />
<br />
Make a go of it? What did that even mean? And a month? Harry had to make a go of it with Malfoy for a whole month?<br />
<br />
Malfoy heaved a theatrically large sigh. &quot;You needn't look so alarmed. This is inconvenient, but hardly an emergency.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well sorry,&quot; Harry told him. He took a deep breath and tried to will his heart to stop thumping. Malfoy wouldn't be this calm if there was really something to be alarmed over. Whatever the spells he'd cast had told him, it'd been enough to make him relax about it. &quot;It's not like they teach this stuff in school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy leveled a scathing look at him. &quot;You're an Auror trainee, aren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, they haven't taught this stuff here, either,&quot; Harry told him. &quot;Look, instead of going on about how this is something I should already know, why don't you save us both a lot of bother and just tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bonds are like any other magic,&quot; Malfoy said, folding his arms over his chest and looking down his nose at Harry. &quot;The stronger the effect of the spell, the more intent they require to cast. This,&quot; He gestured at the handfasting cords, &quot;didn't require any intent from us. Therefore, it's not a powerful spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
He had this I honestly can't believe I've actually got to explain this to you sort of tone to his voice that made Harry want to punch him right in his pointy nose.<br />
<br />
But alas, punching Malfoy (as satisfying as it'd undoubtedly be) would probably only make him even more inclined to be an arsehole about this.<br />
<br />
&quot;So it can be undone?&quot; Harry asked instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it can,&quot; Malfoy said, and he still had that infuriatingly superior tone to his voice. &quot;If we went to St Mungo's, they could have it undone in about five seconds.&quot;<br />
<br />
A great wash of relief swept through Harry. &quot;Fantastic. Let's go.&quot; It's not as if sorting through this junk couldn't wait an hour or so while he and Malfoy got themselves seen to.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Malfoy said, bringing Harry up short. &quot;We're not going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why?&quot; Harry asked, baffled. &quot;You just said they could undo the bond.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, they can. And if we go, there'll be a record of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry gaped at him. &quot;Wait, really? You'd rather spend a month stuck together than report this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As loathe as I am to admit that we fucked up this badly on our very first assignment, no, that's not what I meant,&quot; Malfoy said. &quot;I want you to think very carefully, Potter. This happened in a matter of seconds. Going to St Mungo's would involve people finding out what happened. I wouldn't be surprised if it'd make the papers, seeing as how the entire bloody world is endlessly fascinated with everything you do. Do you really want this to get out into the world where some of your, how shall we say, your more dedicated fans might hear of it and get ideas?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry's stomach clenched. He thought of Romilda Vane. All it'd take was one gossipy Mediwitch or Mediwizard, one patient overhearing something they shouldn't, just one person going to the papers. Even four weeks of Malfoy's unrelenting company would be better than the sheer ongoing hell that would come of this if the papers ran a story about what had happened, because at least there'd be an end to Malfoy. At least Harry knew that Malfoy wouldn't do anything worse to him than pick a fight or two or twelve, and Harry had plenty of experience with Malfoy acting like a complete arsehole.<br />
<br />
But why should Malfoy care? He wouldn't be affected by any of that, if the story got out. And there was no way he was offering to protect Harry out of the goodness of his heart. He'd want something for it. And Harry was willing to bet he already had something in mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you do this for me? What do you want in return?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I owe you a Life Debt,&quot; Malfoy said right away. &quot;I want to be absolved of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry had never intended to call it in--the idea of forcing anyone to do his will made him deeply uncomfortable--so it was a small enough price to pay. &quot;Deal,&quot; he said, offering his hand.<br />
<br />
After a brief hesitation, Malfoy reached out and they shook. His fingers were cold and a little clammy, and Harry rubbed his hand on his thigh after they let go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what?&quot; Harry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we do our jobs and finish with these bloody trunks,&quot; Malfoy said. He picked up one of the paper envelopes layered with protective charms they'd been given for anything that might pose a threat. He enlarged it with a tap of his wand, picked up the handfasting cords and slipped them inside, sealed it, labeled it, and tossed it in the evidence box. Then he lifted a silver cigarette case out of the trunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you mentioned effects,&quot; Harry said after a few minutes. &quot;What exactly are we facing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy gave him a put-upon look as he tossed the cigarette case into the evidence box and made an entry for it on the inventory list. Harry clenched his teeth and waited him out.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're required to spend time together,&quot; Malfoy said. He picked up a fancy crystal inkwell, and held it up to the light to examine a smudge of dried blue ink in the bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that's all?&quot; Harry prompted when Malfoy didn't seem inclined to continue. &quot;How much time do we have to spend together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough to satisfy the bond,&quot; Malfoy said. &quot;We'll have to test it later to see how long we can be apart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens then?&quot; Harry asked, patience rapidly wearing thin. Getting answers out of Malfoy was like pulling teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;A wide variety of highly unpleasant physical effects,&quot; Malfoy said. &quot;Weakness, fatigue, insomnia, nausea, headache, et cetera, et cetera. The effects get worse the longer the bonded couple spends away from each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
All of that sounded horrible. &quot;Okay, so we spend time together. That won't be so hard. I mean, we're going to be working together for the next six weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll have to live together, too,&quot; Malfoy said. &quot;Sharing a bed is one of the typical requirements of bonds like these.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry froze. &quot;Sharing a bed?&quot; he echoed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a bond typically used for marriages, Potter,&quot; Malfoy snapped. &quot;Trust me, I'm not thrilled about this, either.&quot;<br />
<br />
It took some effort, but Harry bit back a retort. He bit back a great load of swearing, too. He took a deep breath, then another, and another, until the urge to hex Malfoy subsided. &quot;So, spending lots of time together, living together, sharing a bed. Is there anything else this bond is going to make us do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, that's not enough for you?&quot; Malfoy drawled, and the last thread of Harry's patience gave way.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know why you're forcing me to drag each piece of information out of you, but this is going to be enough of a challenge to get through without you deliberately being an obnoxious dickhead,&quot; Harry told him. <br />
<br />
Malfoy opened his mouth, then shut his mouth again, then very quietly said, &quot;All right.&quot; And it wasn't anything even approaching an apology, but Harry had a feeling it was probably the best he could expect.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, then,&quot; Harry echoed, sitting back in his seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's not much more to it than I've already said,&quot; Malfoy told Harry after a moment. He picked up a pewter figurine of a rearing unicorn from the trunk and examined it. &quot;Sharing a bed, keeping close by each other. Sometimes talking can be a requirement, but we shouldn't have any trouble with that one, as we'll have to talk for work, at least.&quot; He took a breath. &quot;And touch.&quot; His gaze darted up to Harry and then away again quick as a blink. &quot;They usually require touch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Harry said as an image of himself getting fucked by Malfoy flashed through his mind. &quot;We don't have to have sex, do we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy's cheeks were turning steadily pinker. &quot;Most likely not,&quot; he said, which wasn't the solid No that Harry had hoped for, but was certainly better than a definite Yes. &quot;The point of this sort of bond is to encourage two people to get to know each other in the hopes that they'll eventually grow to love each other on their own. Forcing them into doing something they're not ready for rather defeats the point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But forcing them to share a bed doesn't do that,&quot; Harry said skeptically.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a different sort of intimacy,&quot; Malfoy said, still not looking at Harry. &quot;Sex complicates things in a way that sharing a bed won't.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Harry supposed he really couldn't argue with that. Sighing a little to himself, he returned his attention to the job at hand. He reached into the trunk and pulled out a little ceramic bell, and picked up his quill to record it on his inventory.<br />
<br />
- - -x- - -<br />
<br />
Everything went well enough until it was time to leave. Touch, as it turned out, was in fact a requirement of the bond. Thirty minutes after accidentally triggering the spell, a faint itching started up under Harry's skin, and Malfoy sighed and said, &quot;Bollocks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the bond didn't seem to require skin contact, and was easily satisfied by Malfoy stretching out his leg and resting the toe of his polished leather shoe against the side of Harry's trainer for a few minutes. By the third time Malfoy's foot nudged up against his, Harry barely even noticed. They finished sorting through the trunks, delivered the evidence boxes and trunks to Evidence and submitted their paperwork, and they were free to go for the day.<br />
<br />
But go where was currently the topic of some debate.<br />
<br />
&quot;You live in the old Black place, don't you?&quot; Malfoy asked, looking down his nose. &quot;Absolutely not. We'll be staying in my flat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's more space at mine,&quot; Harry tried to argue. &quot;It's a whole house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but we're going to have to stay close to each other,&quot; Malfoy countered. &quot;Having space isn't exactly an issue we need to resolve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine's got a house-elf,&quot; Harry said. He wasn't sure that Kreacher was truly a selling point, but he was banking on the fact that Malfoy had never actually met him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine doesn't have mice,&quot; Malfoy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;My house doesn't have mice,&quot; Harry said defensively. Well, it didn't have many mice. But it was an old house that had been inhabited only occasionally over the last two decades, and Auror training kept Harry busy. He had noticed the occasional scratching sound coming from the walls, and he did keep meaning to do something about it, but he just hadn't got around to it yet. Besides, winter was setting in and that's when Grimmauld Place's annual Doxy infestation tended to flare up, and god only knew why they liked that bloody house so much but each year they swarmed in by the dozens. Really it made sense to wait and then take care of all of it at once, as he'd vaguely been planning to do. And now that Harry thought about it, maybe having Malfoy living with him wouldn't be the best idea after all. &quot;It doesn't,&quot; he insisted anyhow.<br />
<br />
Malfoy only arched his eyebrows skeptically. &quot;Generations of Blacks have lived in that house and were unable to get rid of the mice. It's practically family legend at this point. Yet you expect me to believe that you were somehow able to manage? In, what, seven months?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm the Chosen One?&quot; Harry tried. Malfoy gave him a flat look, and Harry sighed, defeated. &quot;Fine. We'll stay at your flat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lovely,&quot; Malfoy said. &quot;So glad we've got that sorted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy gave Harry his Floo address, and then Harry went to Grimmauld Place to pack up his things. He stamped soot from his shoes, then started up the stairs, unbuttoning the heavy robes of his Auror uniform as he went.<br />
<br />
He'd taken the second largest bedroom in the house, partly because the master bedroom still smelled faintly of hippogriff, no matter what Harry tried to do to remove the smell, and partly because sleeping in the cavernous master bedroom would have only served as even more of a reminder that he was rattling around this big old place all by himself. So he took the smaller bedroom and he tried not to think about the rest of it as best he could. And in any case, this bedroom was on the same floor as the sitting room, which meant that he had to climb up and down less flights of stairs, so using it really did make the most sense.<br />
<br />
After he changed into a pair of jeans and a warm jumper, he tromped up to the attic to fetch his old school trunk. Back down in the bedroom, he packed it with his uniform robes, jeans and shirts and jumpers, pants and socks, and a wool peacoat. A flick of his wand toward the bathroom brought a collection of bottles and jars zipping through the air to deposit themselves into the trunk, soap and shampoo and shaving cream and toothpaste, a toothbrush and a razor, and a fluffy white bath towel. He piled in all his textbooks and class notes, quills and ink and parchment, then threw the backlog of Quidditch magazines that'd been steadily accumulating over the last six months on top. Auror training kept him so busy that he didn't think he'd need anything else while he was staying at Malfoy's. And even if he did forget something, he could stop by easily enough to get it later.<br />
<br />
After a quick trip down to the kitchen to inform Kreacher that he'd be away (Kreacher had been, as Harry had expected, entirely indifferent) and pick up his favorite mug and a box of the tea he preferred, Harry was ready to leave. He hauled his trunk over to the Floo and hesitated. Traveling with a large object wasn't against the law, per se, but the Floo Network Authority did tend to frown upon it. Baggage-related incidents were the second most common cause of Floo Network injuries, and the whole point of staying bonded to Malfoy was to avoid St Mungo's.<br />
<br />
But fuck it, Harry thought to himself as he scooped up a good handful of Floo powder from the repurposed jam jar on the mantel. He was willing to gamble that getting himself accidentally bonded to Malfoy was the worst thing that would happen to him today.<br />
<br />
He was pleased when that turned out to be true. Harry stumbled from Malfoy's Floo and managed to get himself out of the way just in time for his trunk to come clattering out behind him, bringing with it a spray of soot.<br />
<br />
Harry supposed he'd feel worse about it if he weren't so busy feeling impressed with himself that he'd taken his trunk through the Floo and hadn't earned himself a trip to the hospital. He breathed out a soft sigh of relief and looked around at the place he'd be living in for the next four weeks.<br />
<br />
Malfoy's flat was not at all what Harry had imagined. He'd expected something like the Manor, cold and formal, all pale marble and high ceilings, and filled with the sort of furniture that people bought more for decoration than comfort. But Malfoy's flat was warm and surprisingly cozy, with dark wood floors and huge windows. Malfoy had about four bookcases worth of books crammed onto two bookcases, and his sofa and the two matching chairs that flanked it had thick cushions that looked wonderfully soft and inviting. A large Persian rug completed the room, and thank god the soot hadn't quite made it that far.<br />
<br />
Malfoy came in as Harry was still casting charms to clean the floor. &quot;Good Merlin,&quot; he sighed, sounding enormously put-upon. &quot;Is this what I can expect from you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Harry said with very-obviously forced cheerfulness, casting another Scourgify. &quot;Start as you mean to go on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brilliant,&quot; Malfoy said, then sighed again. &quot;Bedroom's through there, I cleared out the left half of the wardrobe and the bottom two bureau drawers for your things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Harry said, caught momentarily flat-footed by Malfoy's unexpected generosity. He'd been prepared to live out of his trunk for the next month. &quot;Thanks. That's very thoughtful of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hardly,&quot; Malfoy said. &quot;I just didn't think I'd be able to stand looking at you in wrinkled robes. Come into the kitchen when you're done. I've got dinner on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Harry said to Malfoy's retreating back. He grabbed his trunk and lugged it into the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Malfoy had painted his walls a soothing shade of blue and decorated them with what looked like illustrated pages from his old Hogwarts Astronomy textbook enlarged and framed. A plush navy blue area rug covered most of the floor, with a soft, thick pile that just begged Harry to dig his toes into it. The furniture was all plain, dark wood, and there was a heavy ceramic lamp in the shape of a Romanian Longhorn on the nightstand, with jewel eyes and an upturned snout and the white lampshade bent into a whimsical shape that looked like a puff of smoke being exhaled.<br />
<br />
And then there was the bed.<br />
<br />
Objectively, it was a very nice bed; it looked soft and inviting, with a puffy duvet in a crisp white cover and a whole heap of fluffy pillows piled up against the headboard. But to Harry, knowing that in a few short hours he'd be climbing into it with Malfoy, together, the mere sight of it made his nerves tie themselves up in knots.<br />
<br />
Harry did his best to put it from his mind, and quickly put his things away, hanging his robes in the wardrobe and putting stacks of tee-shirts and trousers and socks and pants neatly into the bureau drawers Malfoy had cleared for him. When he finished, he closed his trunk and put it against the wall under the window. He didn't see any reason to unpack the rest of it right now.<br />
<br />
Then, bracing himself, he turned and went to join Malfoy in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
- - -x- - -<br />
<br />
Later that evening, Harry lingered in the bathroom as long as he could reasonably get away with, dawdling as he washed his face and brushed his teeth and changed into his pajamas. <br />
<br />
Then, when he could put it off no longer, he shut off the light, stood there in the darkness for a moment to gather his nerve, and then opened up the door.<br />
<br />
Malfoy was already in bed when Harry stepped back into the bedroom, curled up on the right side and facing the wall, leaving the left side of the bed empty for Harry. He stared at Malfoy--the shape his his shoulder made under the covers and the way his hair looked almost gold against the crisp white of the pillowcase--and forced down a fresh wave of panic. He'd been nervous enough about this when the bed was empty; facing the bed with Malfoy in it, with the corner of the sheets on Harry's side turned invitingly down, ready and waiting for him to get in, well. Harry wasn't at all prepared for this.<br />
<br />
He swallowed hard and told himself he was being ridiculous. There wasn't anything worse than a bit of awkwardness that could possibly come of this. This would be fine. There was nothing at all to be worried about.<br />
<br />
Harry got into bed, leaned over to turn off the lamp, slid his glasses safely under his pillow, then settled stiffly on his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn over,&quot; Malfoy said without moving. &quot;We can put our backs to each other. That ought to suffice for contact.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry thought about asking Malfoy to swap sides with him--he normally slept on his right side and lying with his back to Malfoy would put him on his left--but in the end he didn't say anything, just turned obediently over and scooted back, and his arse bumped against Malfoy's. Malfoy quickly shifted away, resettling himself so that their backs pressed together and there was space between the rest of them. Harry wanted to pull the pillow over his head and smother himself with it, because his arse had just touched Malfoy's arse. Touching of arses had just occurred, and worse, Harry's stupid brain refused to stop replaying how it had felt warm and surprisingly soft against his own, and now he was thinking about touching Malfoy's arse with his hands and oh god that was worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nngggh,&quot; Harry said and clasped a hand over his face as a wave of cringey shame washed over him.<br />
<br />
Malfoy shifted around again, the warmth of his back against Harry's disappearing for a moment before he settled against him again. &quot;Are you quite all right over there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Harry said, and was pleased by how totally and completely normal his voice sounded. &quot;I'm fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
It had only been surprise, he decided. Because Malfoy's arse was warm and soft while the rest of him was sharp and bony and cold. That's all it was. Harry was just caught off guard by how touchable Malfoy's arse felt.<br />
<br />
Wait. No. That wasn't--<br />
<br />
Except oh god it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nngggh,&quot; Harry said again, this time with feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Potter,&quot; Malfoy said sharply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Harry muttered, squeezing his eyes shut.<br />
<br />
He thought he would have a hard time falling asleep, between lying on his left and lying next to Malfoy and the whole arse thing, but barely ten minutes later, he was out.<br />
<br />
- - -x- - -<br />
<br />
On the first morning of their forced cohabitation, Harry awoke to an empty bed. Yawning, he sat up and looked around, and found the bedroom quiet and dim. He hadn't even considered how bloody awkward it would feel to wake up next to Malfoy, but it looked like he would get to put off that particular experience until tomorrow.<br />
<br />
He pushed himself out of bed and stretched, then pulled the covers neatly over the bed before he shuffled blearily out into the kitchen in search of his morning cuppa. He found Malfoy seated at the table with both hands curled loosely around a steaming mug, still wearing his green and white plaid pajama bottoms and a soft grey shirt. He had his long legs stretched out under the table, his bare feet looking very pale against the white tile floor, and the sunlight slanting in through the high window backlit his sleep-tousled hair bright gold.<br />
<br />
Oh fuck, thought Harry when his heart gave a funny little shiver at the sight of Malfoy looking so soft and gentle and unexpectedly approachable. This is going to be a problem.<br />
<br />
Malfoy startled a little when he finally noticed Harry, tugging the sleeves of his shirt farther down over his wrists.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Malfoy said, his voice still mellow with sleep, and the sound of it sparked a little flutter in the pit of Harry's stomach. The bright wash of sunshine made his eyes look very clear and strangely colorless. &quot;I thought you'd sleep for a while yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Harry said, looking quickly away. &quot;Well. Here I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's still hot water in the kettle,&quot; Malfoy said after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Harry. &quot;That's, erm. Thanks. Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy was looking at him oddly, and Harry gave him a weak smile before he escaped to the other side of the kitchen. Malfoy had taken Harry's mug and set it beside the kettle for him, and that unexpected bit of thoughtfulness made the flutter in Harry's stomach grow more intense. <br />
<br />
Because Malfoy was an attractive person, Harry couldn't deny that. He'd known for years that Malfoy was exactly his type. But for years that knowledge had only remained an idle observation because Malfoy was horrible and it was really hard to be properly attracted to someone when you also wanted to punch them in their stupid pointy nose all the time. But this Malfoy? Who was still a little sleepy and still a little rumpled, warm and loose and relaxed and for once not being a total arse?<br />
<br />
Yeah. Harry could already see this was going to be a problem.<br />
<br />
He took his time making his tea, lingering over it until the fluttering in his stomach slowly faded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have anything you need to do today?&quot; Harry asked as he took his mug over to the table. He hoped some conversation would distract him from himself, or that Malfoy would say something to remind Harry just how much he disliked Malfoy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean besides go into the Ministry?&quot; Malfoy asked dryly. He stretched out his feet under the table as soon as Harry sat down so that they were touching. His toes were cold even through the warm layer of Harry's socks. &quot;This morning's thrilling lecture topic is Application Requests for the Submission of Evidence Confirming Uncorroborated New Testimony. And why they think we need to know that, I haven't the faintest. Aurors have nothing to do with trying criminals. That's all the Wizengamot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess they want us to know all the aspects of how a case proceeds?&quot; Harry offered even though he also thought it was ridiculous. Harry shifted his foot so it sat partially atop Malfoy's, covering up his cold toes. His heartbeat quickened and he did his best to ignore it. This was just Malfoy's foot; no reason to get worked up over that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bloody waste of time,&quot; Malfoy muttered into his mug.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, if all you've got planned today is training, would you mind going out this evening?&quot; Harry asked, opting to move the conversation along.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've got lecture again tomorrow morning,&quot; Malfoy said, frowning.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know,&quot; Harry said. &quot;It'd just be for a little while, we wouldn't be out late. It's just that I had plans to meet Ron and Hermione at a pub. Hermione's so busy with her job with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures that I hardly get to see her anymore. I mean, even Ron hardly gets to see her and they live together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy grimaced. &quot;Fine,&quot; he said. His foot twitched beneath Harry's. &quot;But you're paying for my drinks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal,&quot; Harry said quickly.<br />
<br />
Malfoy looked at him suspiciously. Had Harry said that too quickly? He'd probably said that too quickly. But Malfoy shook his head and went back to his tea, and Harry let it go.<br />
<br />
He'd figure out how to convince Malfoy to go to a pub in Muggle London later. Harry had the whole day to wo</td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">It's a quiet afternoon the day Midoriya Izuku learns he's quirkless.<br />
<br />
He is a boy of dreams and passion, of wide eyes and determined smiles. He sees heroes on those bright screens and thinks, &quot;I want to be like them.&quot; He sees the gratefulness and the admiration of those saved and rescued and thinks, &quot;I want to save people like them.&quot; He sees them standing strong and tall, against terror and battles, and thinks &quot;I want to be a hero like them.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's a want, a deep-seated ambition, that is carved and etched into his muscles and bones, the way ink tattoos dyes skin an intricate black. He is four, but he thinks he's meant for more.<br />
<br />
But the thing is, in a world such as his, society is built on power. It's a rule of the world, a fact, something that will never change no matter how much time passes. History is built on wars and blood, and no matter how the people of today sweeten it with light sugary words and white lies, it is a fact that the world is not built on understanding.<br />
<br />
It is built on quirks, of strength blessed upon the lucky. It's a kind of strength that is god given, because there is no other way to explain now how men can call forth flames and nature onto their palms so naturally. And what are heroes, but people with a drive for fame and glory, wealth and riches, and overwhelming power at their fingertips?<br />
<br />
It is a quiet afternoon when Midoriya Izuku's mother brings him to a man dressed in white, whose lips are pressed flatly together as he tells a child who holds dreams too big for him to hold, a boy who has nothing except a deep-seated selfish want for something more, that his dreams would amount to nothing but that. Distant dreams.<br />
<br />
It is a quiet afternoon Midoriya Izuku is told he is quirkless, and as his mother holds him in his arms like he's cracked glass, as if he'd shatter the moment she presses too much, he thinks the world is cruel.<br />
<br />
For whatever gods or beings who have given men wings to fly to a fate they want themselves and have tied boulders to his, he decides, world be damned, he'll tear them off and make his own wings to soar. He swears it.<br />
<br />
And people reflect the world they live in, so they are mean and horrible, their words sharp and jagged. They cut into his flesh like poison-laced knives, and they are words that are engraved into his mind for years and years to come. <br />
<br />
But a hero- well, heroes are strong, aren't they? Heroes wouldn't let words get to them. Heroes would hold tight to what they believe. Heroes are strong and big and powerful. <br />
<br />
Heroes are-<br />
<br />
&quot;Useless Deku,&quot; Bakugou sneers, lips twisted into a derisive snarl. There's an anger in him that bubbles forth like magma, a hate that wasn't there before. &quot;You'll never be a hero! You're a quirkless waste of space, and you should learn your place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heroes are good people, aren't they? <br />
<br />
&quot;Kacchan,&quot; Izuku tries weakly, bruises stinging on his arms and legs. They hurt and ache, they scream at him to still and stop and rest. He stumbles up instead. &quot;Kacchan, you don't-&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly he's on the ground ( again ) and it burns. His ears ring loudly, his head muddled and foggy and he can't think straight, and then, &quot;Shut up! Don't call me that!&quot; Izuku blinks out the rising tears in his eyes as he tilts his head up, and sees Bakugou standing strong above him, looking down at him. Something bitter and hot scratches at his throat, and he bites his lips hard enough to draw blood. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be a hero,&quot; Bakugou says, an unrivalled confidence oozing out of his form, &quot;and you'll just be Deku. A useless nobody.&quot;<br />
<br />
And there are two truths in Izuku's life. Heroes are good. Kacchan doesn't lie. <br />
<br />
So as he feels red heat drip down his chin, splattering on the dirt below him, feels the scratches and burns that throb on his shoulder and bare flesh, he wonders if this is what it means to be a hero. He wonders, for a long long time, if this is what good is. <br />
<br />
Kacchan is going to be a hero. Heroes are good. He repeats this to himself every time he earns a new bruise, a new scar, a new burn, another concerned and worried look from his mother. And what is he?<br />
<br />
Deku, he whispers aloud, at the dead of night in his room. Izuku Midoriya and Deku are one in the same, and to him, there is no telling where Deku ends and he begins. He starts to believe his new namesake. <br />
<br />
So days drag on too long, rueful and scathing glances fixed on his small body becoming a common occurrence. He's used to it now. He has to be. He needs to be. Heroes are strong. Home is his only safe place, and so one day as he rushes there because it hurts going anywhere but there, he's met with the sight of his mother sobbing on the couch, tears staining her cheeks.<br />
<br />
Heroes are strong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama?&quot; he asks, keeping his voice steady. He quietly walks over to her shaking body, watching her curled form stiffen and turn to him, red-rimmed eyes meeting with wide green ones. A broken sob escapes her lips as she pulls him into a tight hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Izuku, baby,&quot; she says wetly, trying but failing to keep her voice from cracking. &quot;Your father- your father isn't coming back home.&quot; <br />
<br />
It doesn't quite register completely, her words, as his little hand curls around his mother's wrinkled shirt. He feels his shoulder dampen, but he doesn't mind. Doesn't mind the jolt of pain that comes again when she holds him tight. He is strong. He'll be strong for his mother. He's smart enough to know at the news of this, there is nobody by their corner to help them except each other. There is no way to make ends meet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mama,&quot; he says, as firmly as he can, &quot;I'll find a job! I'll- I'll make all the money in the world! Then you won't need to worry!&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiles tearfully, brushing gently through his tangle of hair. &quot;Sweetie, it'll be okay. I'll find a job and we'll- we'll be okay. You're going to be a hero, aren't you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Oh he does want to, so, so badly, and the thought of not becoming a hero has never crossed his mind. But he looks at his mother, fighting to hold a strong smile on her face, he thinks, for her, he'll throw away this dream of his. Heroes save people, don't they? It'll be fine, for him, if he only saves one person. And it's even better if it's his Mama. Anything, if it's his Mama. He beams back at her, bright and wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fine Mama,&quot; he says. And with a strange brutal honesty, &quot;I'm quirkless. I-&quot; he gulps, &quot;I can't become a hero. But I'll save you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Inko says nothing and only pulls him closer, whispering reassurances for the both of them. Izuku buries the little voice in his head that screams for him: become a hero! He listens to the voice that says: help your mother. Help and give and save for all the things she's given.<br />
<br />
It's a solemn evening Midoriya Izuku learns that his father is dead, and his life tilts itself over on its own head. It's a solemn evening Midoriya Izuku finds a new dream, a new goal of his. <br />
<br />
The wounds on his skin ache painfully, but to him, it is the price of being weak. So he'll grow stronger. For his mother. For his Mama. <br />
<br />
&quot;It'll be okay,&quot; he whispers, more for himself. &quot;Because I'm here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma'am, I assure you, there are no nuts in the burger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midoriya is tired. There's a lady with too much eyeliner who is screaming at him because there are lumps on her burger, convinced that they were trying to kill her, and he's running on four cups of Redbull and crushed Smarties. He doesn't get people.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are lumps!&quot; The lady shrieks with the indignity of a woman who has seen someone murder her entire family in front of her in cold blood. &quot;There are lumps in the burger with nuts in them, and I'm allergic!&quot;<br />
<br />
Midoriya, who has seen a man eat chicken nuggets with Sunny D orange juice as a dipping sauce and a soup, who has seen a man chug a whole bottle of mayonnaise like a shot in seven seconds, is barely affected by the spittle she sprays onto him as she screams about food allergies. He can handle this, he tells himself. Do it for the paycheck.<br />
<br />
This is minimum wage, a small part of him drawls lazily. Who cares?<br />
<br />
I do! he yells back at himself. I'm fucking broke! I'll take what I can!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma'am,&quot; he tries, &quot;Miss, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Would you like it if I could redo it for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're patronizing me,&quot; she says, scandalized. Izuku wonders, for the fifth time, if the paycheck was worth it. She leans forward, rudely pointing towards him. &quot;You, boy, what's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Midoriya Izuku,&quot; he answers, then looks at the nametag on his shirt. Is she illiterate? God, he was losing brain cells here. Working in customer service wasn't doing anything good for his head.<br />
<br />
She nods, her attitude taking a complete 180 from seconds before. &quot;Midoriya-san,&quot; she says gently, as if talking to a child, which, rude, who's the one who controls what she eats here? Not that he'd poison her, but it's something he's considering. &quot;Midoriya-san, that's a nice name. I'm Akane, and I'm allergic to nuts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this some kind of interview? Midoriya wonders dryly. He's tempted to answer in kind, 'And I'm allergic to bullshit, so excuse me if I throw up anytime soon,' but he would like to not get fired, so he keeps his mouth shut with the patience of a saint. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm allergic to nuts,&quot; she repeats, like it's important, &quot;and there are nuts in my burger. I didn't order nuts.&quot; <br />
<br />
There's a line starting to form behind her, all people wearing varying levels of exhaustion and exasperation, all of which he wishes he could show but can't because he has his default customer service smile, made perfectly to show others cry for help. Someone's recording, but he can't find it in himself to care. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, ma'am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Akane. That's my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Akane-san.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; she nods, seemingly satisfied. &quot;So why are there nuts in my burger?&quot;<br />
<br />
He's not paid enough for this. So he does what any other underpaid teenager working at McDonald's would do in such a situation: he shoves this problem onto the manager. <br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like me to call the manager?&quot; he offers, a tad too quickly. &quot;I'm sure he is much better suited to help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane looks like she had reached the greatest epiphany in the world, which would be false, because that right had been given to Midoriya the moment he came up with the idea to pass off this problem to his manager. &quot;Yes, show me your manager unless you want to lose a customer!&quot;<br />
<br />
Plan is a success, he thinks smugly, resisting the urge to pump his fist in victory. Honestly, who'd care if she didn't come again? Whatever the case, this wasn't his problem. But before he can turn around to fetch said manager, the wall next to him bursts and explodes. <br />
<br />
There's screams that echo in the air as people scramble away from the sudden wreckage. The wall is caved in now, the debris crushing half of the counter and two cash registers, to which Midoriya mourns the loss of money. Shit, he thinks to himself, that was a good few thousand yen in there! He was going to absolutely beat the fuck out of whoever had the audacity to break into a McDonald's and destroy cash.<br />
<br />
A masked man emerges from the dust, scales rippling under his torn shirt as he holds a gun in his hands. The mask is shoddy at best, a black ski mask that looked like it was cut with safety scissors pulled onto his head. There were too many things here for Midoriya to process. Why was this guy, a man with an obvious mutant quirk that strengthened himself enough to bring down a wall, holding a gun? Why was the man here? <br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone, get on the ground or I'll gut you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Midoriya isn't very impressed by this threat, and as everybody in the restaurant scrambles down to the dirty tile floor in a hazy panic, he stares straight into the masked man's eyes with a resignation that comes with being in customer service for far too long.<br />
<br />
God, he's going to demand a raise after this. Better yet, maybe even file a lawsuit against this guy. Could he do that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir,&quot; he says, an all too wide and all too fake smile plastered tightly on his face. The masked robber turns to glare at him, but seeing the look on Izuku's face, gulps, the gun in his hands shaking ever so slightly. &quot;This is a McDonald's. Why the fuck are you robbing a McDonald's.&quot;<br />
<br />
The masked robber suddenly looks very unsure. Good for him, Midoriya thinks. He hopes the guy is sorting out his options properly right now. But, well, he has a job to do, so his smile widens almost painfully so.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; he says cheerfully, &quot;will it be dine-in or to-go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I. Wait. I'm robbing this store.&quot; He says it as if he's not sure why he came here again and he's trying to remind himself why. Midoriya can understand. He can't count how many times he's walked into the kitchen or living room and wondered why he came there in the first place. He gives a nod of sage acknowledgment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen. I forget why I'm at some places before too,&quot; he tells him. &quot;I was at a pet store once. I don't know why. I don't have any pets. I didn't even want any. I was just there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The robber, lowering his gun, was looking progressively more confused. &quot;What. Listen brat, get on the-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're online sims,&quot; Midoriya says with a start. &quot;Shit, why didn't I think of that. Sir, you don't need to do this. You're probably being controlled by some higher being forcing you to do this for fun. Is your life really low enough to the point where you feel the need to rob a McDonald's?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck are you talking about?&quot; Then, with a crease of his brow, &quot;You're insulting me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Midoriya says, nodding like a teacher who's congratulating a student who got a question right after three wrong answers. Then, apologetically, &quot;Sorry, don't have any stickers for you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want any-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure you don't,&quot; he says sympathetically. &quot;It's okay. I'll make sure to give you one later. I'll be extra nice and give you one with glitter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On a second thought,&quot; Midoriya continues on, completely ignoring the armed masked man, &quot;your mask sucks. Looks like a primary schooler made it. Full offense. I'm revoking sticker privileges. I'll give you a high five though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I worked hard on this mask! I'm not taking criticism from some fucking middle-schooler.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should be more open-minded,&quot; he suggests helpfully. &quot;Works wonders, really.&quot;<br />
<br />
From the corner of his eyes, he sees most of the customers looking at him like he was going insane, to which, well, fair, but none of them has been shot and no money has been lost so-<br />
<br />
The cash registers, he remembers with a start. The money. That this dick destroyed.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll drink his brain juice like a fucking McFlurry.<br />
<br />
<br />
The robber lifts up the gun again, aiming it towards Izuku's head, but the boy has never really been the type to have any kind of self-preservation skills, and adding to the fact that this asswipe here decided to destroy the money he probably came here to steal, money that Izuku should've gotten in his pockets-<br />
<br />
Well. This combination never bodes well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, enough messing around,&quot; the masked scaled man snarls, fingers pressing against the trigger. &quot;Brat, give me the money in the cashier or I will fucking shoot you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn't do it, bet,&quot; Midoriya replies reflexively, then realizes his mistake. Okay, that was not a good move, even for him.<br />
<br />
The masked man looks completely baffled now, his expression of anger and confusion obvious even from beneath his mask. &quot;Do you, like, want to die?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; he says honestly, then headbutts the gun hard and suddenly enough to force the man to drop it. It clatters to the ground with a loud thud, and in a split second of stunned silence, Midoriya takes the chance to leap over the broken counter and grab the man by the shoulders to headbutt him.<br />
<br />
The robber only manages to stumble back in shock to avoid it, and immediately, Midoriya throws a well-aimed jab at the back of his neck, the place he's sure there were no scales to block it, and the man falls like a sack of bricks. <br />
<br />
Well. &quot;That was quick,&quot; he says, almost disappointed. He nudges the unconscious man with his foot none too gently, feeling vaguely scammed, then turns back to the broken cash registers. His eyebrow twitches in irritation, then again, not bothering to be subtle, he kicks the masked man again on the side with more force.<br />
<br />
There's dead silence in the McDonald's now, other people from outside peeking in to get a look on the situation worriedly. Midoriya wonders if any of them called the cops or heroes. The commotion should've attracted the attention of one of them at least. <br />
<br />
He turns to the other people in the restaurant, eyes landing on the lady from before with main character syndrome. His brows furrow in thought as he tries to remember her name. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Akabane-san,&quot; he addresses her, the woman's shoulders jolting suddenly as she scrambled to stand up. &quot;Right. Well. Can you call the police? Heroes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Akane,&quot; she says weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right. That's what I said.&quot;<br />
<br />
She blinks, opening her mouth to say something before decidedly closing her mouth shut. Not caring for whatever she was struggling with, he raises a brow as he waits for her to answer his question. She realizes this and nods sharply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yes, well, someone else already did. They're on their way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midoriya turns to the unconscious man on the floor. Maybe he should tie him up. Restrain him. Though, he's pretty sure there's nothing here that this guy couldn't rip, considering what his quirk probably was. <br />
<br />
Five minutes later, when heroes and police have arrived, they're met with the sight of a teenage boy sitting on the back of a half-awake man with a badly cut ski mask pulled halfway off his face, the hole where his mouth was supposed to be revealing his nose instead. <br />
<br />
When the boy notices them approaching, he waves and stands up with a bounce. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Tsukauchi-kun!&quot; He greets the first man, smiling brightly. &quot;Nice to see you again!&quot;<br />
<br />
The man in question squints, turns to look at the subdued villain on the ground, then offers a defeated look towards Izuku in return. &quot;Midoriya-kun,&quot; he says, tired, &quot;this is the fourth time this week I've seen you at a crime scene.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's. That's not too bad, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Wednesday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.&quot; Midoriya purses his lips in thought. &quot;Not my fault. Why would someone even want to rob a McDonald's? I think that's just a poor life decision. Also,&quot; he pauses, tilting his head to take a full look at Tsukauchi. &quot;Why do you look like you have a hangover?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tsukauchi thinks back to the bottle of vodka waiting in his desk drawer at the office, and the corner of his mouth twitches. &quot;I don't drink on the job if that's what you're suggesting.&quot; And then, &quot;Midoriya, I've had to handle almost ten cases of villain attacks and takedowns this month, and we're only two weeks in. All of which, you're involved in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; he says. &quot;And?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And why are you always there when a villain is?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, you think I wanted to be attacked by a discount Sandman at Walmart?&quot; Midoriya cries out. &quot;That di- villain filled my grocery bag with sand and for what? He just gave me something to hit him with!&quot; After a lapse of silence, he murmurs something about why villains were attacking shitty grocery and fast food chains in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's almost like you have a quirk that attracts trouble,&quot; Tsukauchi sighs. &quot;Alright, I'll have to ask you what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it started when this Aka lady was yelling about how there were lumps in her hamburger...&quot; <br />
<br />
Tsukauchi, holding his notepad, thinks today is going to be another long day. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Izuku, sweetie, why are you trending on Twitter?&quot; <br />
<br />
Midoriya turns his head slowly to where his mother was sitting, eyebrows raising up as she began to read out loud: &quot;'Teenage boy working at McDonald's takes down a robber.' Izuku, what are you doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Self defense,&quot; he offers weakly. &quot;Also they're giving me my paycheck early.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a video of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Then after a thoughtful silence, &quot;You think I'd be able to make money off of this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to your room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma'am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midoriya, in true Midoriya fashion, somehow befriends our resident emo brainwasher, and along the way gets a cat<br />
<br />
Yes there will be Sunny D slander ahead. That shit nasty I've said what I've said<br />
<br />
<br />
(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Midoriya thinks working at a pet store is a lot better than working at a McDonald's.<br />
<br />
Okay. Well, saying that out loud makes it obvious. It's the same pet store he ended up in for a reason only the deepest recesses of his brain knows. He won't bother trying to find it. <br />
<br />
He manages to land a job there, somehow. The owner is a grandma who makes killer dango, but he's also seen her stab a drunkard loitering around with the end of her cane, so he makes sure never to piss her off. Maybe his looks helped with getting this job. He's heard a lot from others that he looks innocent.<br />
<br />
He makes sure to flip them off at their face. Innocent his ass, he's faced death enough to know that he could fist fight god and win. <br />
<br />
It's a slow shift, the occasional couple or family coming in to gawk and stare at an animal they won't get. He lounges at the counter, his fingers itching to pull out his notebook in his bag. He's been meaning to finish up the rest of his analysis on some underground heroes he managed to research after some deep digging on the internet ( the fourth page of Google ).<br />
<br />
After the latest customer walks out the door, Midoriya slips out his notebook onto the counter and clicks on his pen. Only seconds after he begins to scribble something down, a faint scratching noise echoes behind him. He pauses, waiting for it to come again, and upon hearing silence, continues to write. <br />
<br />
Then the noise comes again, more persistent than before, and he closes his notebook. Walking towards the back, where the scratching noise was getting louder, he slows to a stop at the back door that led to the alley between here and the convenience store next door. <br />
<br />
This is the start of my horror movie experience, Midoriya realizes with more enthusiasm than he probably should have. With renewed vigor, he pushes open the door to find-<br />
<br />
A cat.<br />
<br />
It's a cute cat. But Midoriya has never really been a cat kind of guy. Feeling faintly disappointed, he stares at the calico cat who mewls up at him petulantly before walking past him and into the shop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey wait--&quot; Midoriya instantly holds out his leg to block the cat's way into the store. &quot;Little bastard. You can't go in there.&quot; In response, the cat gives him an annoyed paw to the leg, before attempting to move past him again. He sighs, and pushes the door shut. &quot;There. Can't get in.&quot; <br />
<br />
The cat shoots him an affronted look, and Midoriya stares back, equally offended, until they're locked into a staring contest he's determined not to lose. The cat has weird eyes, he thinks. He's going to win. <br />
<br />
He doesn't know how much time passes until the cat finally blinks and turns away from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot; he says, triumphantly. &quot;Loser.&quot;<br />
<br />
Somehow, the cat seems to feel his tone of mockery, and promptly launches itself onto him, claws drawn, before he could even back away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow-! Shit, what the fu-&quot;<br />
<br />
Grabbing the cat by the back of its neck, he holds it up as it goes limp and stares wide-eyed into his own eyes. &quot;Okay, sore loser,&quot; Midoriya hisses, &quot;if you came here for food, you just lost your one last chance to get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cat mewls. Midoriya sets the cat down. The cat mewls again, but louder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not,&quot; he warns. &quot;Stop. Stop doing that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cat curls around his legs. He doesn't think this is normal cat behavior. Is he destined to attract the crazy ones, even with animals? &quot;You- uh.&quot; He thinks for a second before decidedly settling on calling the cat, &quot;Sunny D. You don't deserve a good food name. You get the imposter orange juice brand as a name. You're welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sunny D stares.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ungrateful,&quot; he scoffs, but gently scoops the cat up. &quot;Fine. Fine, you're getting some cat food. We got extra in the back.&quot; Sunny D purrs in satisfaction, and Midoriya has the faint feeling he's fallen into some kind of trap. Like a pyramid scheme. <br />
<br />
He feels like he's missing something here.<br />
<br />
Oh. Right. <br />
<br />
He's working right now.<br />
<br />
Dropping Sunny D onto the floor as soon as he steps back into the pet store, he races back to the front because he does not want to be caught slacking off during his shift by the scary grandma. He'd get no dango, and there's no way he'd endanger his chance to get free food!<br />
<br />
Luckily, as he tries to casually slide back behind the counter, there's only one other person in the store. Midoriya gives him a quick look over, the first thing catching his attention was the messy tangle of lavender hair. Huh. And he thought his hair was bad. <br />
<br />
The teenager was browsing the cat food aisle, shuffling through it quietly as Midoriya let himself relax. Growing bored of watching the other, he turns his eyes to the back, seeing Sunny D march up to where he was and, unexpectedly, screech. Very loudly.<br />
<br />
The purple-haired teenager flinches, and Midoriya fights down the urge to punt Sunny D onto God's doormat. <br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck.&quot; The teenager says. &quot;Is that your cat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Midoriya denies immediately, and right after Sunny D jumps onto his lap. Torn between petting them or shoving them off of him, his internal struggle is cut short as the teenager from before stares at the cat and speaks up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, that cat is the one from the alley,&quot; he says, obviously confused. Midoriya nods slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah. Do you know them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her.&quot; A pause, and then, &quot;I've been feeding her when I could. Didn't think she'd warm up so quickly to someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She attacked me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He snorts at that, his eyebrows raising in amusement. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She attacked me,&quot; Midoriya repeats, &quot;because she lost a staring contest with me. Sunny D is a sore loser. She is also a war criminal.&quot; Said cat has found its place on his two legs, purring softly. &quot;Want her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah.&quot; He puts down the cat food back onto the shelf as he murmurs questioningly under his breath 'Sunny D?' Midoriya curses at Sunny D for the loss of a potential buyer. The purple-haired teen ends the conversation there, obviously not wanting to talk any longer. Midoriya gets it, but he also thinks Sunny D is a bastard who he will absolutely not keep.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Midoriya Izuku,&quot; he says, flicking at his plastic name tag. &quot;How about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
There's a small silence that follows after his question, and Midoriya almost makes a dick joke to break it before the teen answers, &quot;Shinsou Hitoshi.&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice is quieter than before, not in the way where he's shy, Midoriya notices, but more in the way where he doesn't want to be seen. It's the kind of quiet he understands, because Midoriya is Midoriya Izuku, the boy who defied the odds and was born powerless among the blessed. It's a quiet he understands, because it's the kind that is learned from years of being beaten down and denied of his voice. <br />
<br />
Maybe he'll talk to this guy a little more.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure you don't want Sunny D?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she was just a stray I fed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; Midoriya says, &quot;so you're a cat guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot; Then like a random afterthought, &quot;I'm quirkless, by the way.&quot; Shinsou's head snaps towards him in surprise and shock. Midoriya says it without a care, as if he were describing the weather or what to eat for lunch. Shinsou, understandably, is confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;What.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So what's yours?&quot; Midoriya asks. Because Midoriya, for as much as he preaches about how he cares for nothing but money and his mom, is still a hero. That dream of his is stained onto his skin and bone, never quite fading away like he says it did. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you asking?&quot; Shinsou's brows furrow together in slight irritation and apprehensiveness. Maybe he came on a little too strong, Midoriya thinks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Curious,&quot; he answers, then pulls out his notebook to wave. &quot;I like to write about quirks. Underground heroes, daylight heroes, whatever quirk that looks interesting. Hey, don't look at me like that, I'm not a stalker. It's a hobby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you're looking for a 'cool' quirk, you're better off asking for someone else,&quot; Shinsou says, the bitterness in his voice unhidden. Midoriya thinks he's starting to understand this boy a little better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be like that,&quot; he drawls, fiddling with his pen. &quot;I don't care about shit like flashiness or whatever. I just like quirks. Sue the quirkless kid for being interested in them, why don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
They stare off, one of them tense and the other relaxed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brainwashing,&quot; Shinsou states matter-of-factly, like he'd rather get this over with. Midoriya nods, flipping to a new page and writing something down. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's one I haven't seen before,&quot; he murmurs, looking back up at Shinsou. &quot;How does it work? How do you activate it? Is it eye contact or verbal initiation? How long can you hold it? How many people can you control at once?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...That's a lot of questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Midoriya says, not apologetic. &quot;So?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You- that's it?&quot; Shinsou frowns, but it's less angry and more confused. &quot;That's all you're going to ask? Say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Midoriya tilts his head slightly in thought. &quot;What else? Well, from what I'm seeing, I guess people don't really like your quirk, huh.&quot; Shinsou barely winces, but it's enough for Midoriya to catch on. &quot;What do you want me to say, that your quirk is perfect for being a villain?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Shinsou could answer, Midoriya continued to talk. &quot;Listen, I don't really give a shit. Quirks depend on the user, yeah? Thought that was pretty common knowledge. You wanna be a hero?&quot; Shinsou could only mutely nod, and Midoriya grins with all teeth, &quot;There you go! Ignore the dipshits who say that stuff. Maybe even beat them up. That's what I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beat them up,&quot; Shinsou reiterates slowly. &quot;I'm not a delinquent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me neither,&quot; Midoriya shrugs. &quot;Do I look like one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like Sunny D isn't the only one here who's committed war crimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's. Okay, that's fair. But still,&quot; Midoriya taps his pen on the counter. &quot;You haven't answered my question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't need to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop making fair points.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is wrong with you,&quot; Shinsou says, not really a question but put off nonetheless. There's no malice in his voice, so Midoriya doesn't take much offense. Again, Shinsou makes another valid point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take your pick,&quot; Midoriya says, spreading his arms like he's trying to sell something. He grins. &quot;The trauma? The whole quirkless thing? The fact I've run into ten villains this month?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've what.&quot; And then, &quot;Do you always overshare with strangers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Midoriya admits, unashamedly. &quot;Not as much as this usually. Be the cryptid you want to see in your life, y'know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I. I really don't.&quot; Shinsou looks like he aged five years from this conversation. &quot;Will you leave me alone if I tell you how my quirk works?&quot; Midoriya shrugs, but the shit-eating grin on his face only gives him a bad feeling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly. I don't give guarantees.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then suddenly everything goes foggy. Midoriya feels himself go absolutely still, and almost as if he weren't in his own body. Something tugs at his mind, binding it, and as he tries to move anything - his hands, his legs, his head - he is only met with failure. <br />
<br />
Brainwashing, his mind supplies. This is so fucking cool.<br />
<br />
Then with a start, he's back in the pet store by the counter, in front of Shinsou. The boy looks tired, moreso, but Izuku smiles widely in fascination.<br />
<br />
&quot;So it's verbal? Do I have to answer a question, or just reply back to whatever you say? I couldn't control myself at all! That quirk has way too many applications-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.&quot; Shinsou massages his temple, a disbelieving chuckle escaping his lips. &quot;You just got brainwashed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just got brainwashed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard you the first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any sense of self preservation or danger?&quot; Shinsou asks, aghast. <br />
<br />
&quot;That is a good question.&quot; He pauses. &quot;I've heard that I don't.&quot; Midoriya carelessly waves his hand, as if brushing off the topic. &quot;Anyways, mind telling me the details of your quirk? Man, it felt like I was having sleep paralysis but without the demon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a question you have to answer for it to activate,&quot; Shinsou says, giving up on trying to understand the boy in front of him. He came here for cat food and instead gets a guy his age he's pretty sure must've committed some form of tax fraud. &quot;I can't make the person do any complicated things, like answering questions.&quot;<br />

&quot;Probably need to train with it more to do that,&quot; Midoriya mutters, his pen flying across his notebook as he quickly writes down the information. &quot;Verbal activation, answering a question, can't make the controlled do anything complicated...&quot;<br />
<br />
Shinsou stares at him as he continues to mutter rapidfire under his breath, soon filling up two pages in what seemed like no time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shinsou,&quot; Midoriya says suddenly, &quot;can I have your number?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Shinsou says, caught off guard. &quot;What.&quot;<br />
<br />

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There are two types of people in this world: morning people, and those who want to shoot morning people.<br />
<br />
Yoongi falls firmly within the second category.<br />
<br />
And the incessant, loud ringing of the doorbell does nothing to disprove that fact. Tossing in bed, Yoongi groans, barely awake to register any coherent thought. It's probably the neighbors. Some deliveryman for the family with their three kids or Jung Hoseok two doors down. <br />
<br />
<br />
Dingdingdingding--<br />
<br />
<br />
Who the fuck orders things at this hour? It's way too early--the sun's still up, fuck's sake. Yoongi wants to make full use of his snooze time as much as possible, thank you very much. He shoves his head beneath his pillow to drown out the endless buzzing ricocheting off the walls like a loudhailer, waiting for the noise to cease.<br />
<br />
But it doesn't. It prattles on and on, not unlike the way his mother used to nag at him for shirking dishwashing duty back in high school.<br />
<br />
Somewhere behind his closed eyes and at the back of his mind, Yoongi wonders if the bell is actually ringing for him, but then he dismisses the thought as soon as it comes. Of course not. The last time he had friends over was... ah, right. <br />
<br />
Never.<br />
<br />
It's definitely for the folks next door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Min Yoongi-ssi?&quot;<br />
<br />
Or not.<br />
<br />
Breath snagging, Yoongi's eyes crack opens. His first thought is: who?<br />
<br />
And then: why?<br />
<br />
Because let it be known that Min Yoongi is not a person of parties. He's not huge on inviting people to come within the range of his personal space, let alone his own damn living quarters, so who in the world could be looking for him--knowing his name, even--at hell o'clock in the morning?<br />
<br />
He drags his feet from bed and trudges to the door, yawning while stretching, and when he peeks through the peephole, he finds a tall man clad in a suit standing on the other side. Like, an actual formal suit, with a tie and all, this early in the morning. An insurance agent? If so, that's fucked up. Just goes to show what next sales tactics these relentless white-collar workers are up to these days. They sure have a lot of nerve knocking from door-to-door now.<br />
<br />
Yoongi frowns and calls out, &quot;What the hell do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
A muffled voice from the other side of the door answers, &quot;Hello! It would be better to explain face to face.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I know you're not trying to break in and rob me?&quot; Yoongi slurs the question, still groggy.<br />
<br />
A pause. &quot;With all due respect--if that were the case, I wouldn't bother to knock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fair point. With a sigh, Yoongi keys in his passcode and opens the door just a crack, barely enough for a gust of summer air to blow through, and his bleary eyes land on his uninvited guest's face. The man is as tall as a tree, one arm clutching a thick file of papers while the other hand holds a leather laptop bag. He smiles at Yoongi and gives a small wave. <br />
<br />
Yoongi crinkles his nose. &quot;So. How can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; says Mr. Suit Guy. &quot;I'm Kim Namjoon, your grandfather's lawyer, and I'm here to discuss your assets.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yoongi blinks. His grandfather? He's never even met the old man, was never introduced to him. &quot;My... assets?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man nods, moving forward to invite himself into Yoongi's flat. &quot;Yes. If we could sit down--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry but,&quot; Yoongi bars Namjoon's entry with a pale arm, &quot;what is going on here, exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Namjoon pauses, startled, then flashes him a look heavy with pity. &quot;Min Yoongi-ssi. I'm afraid your grandfather is dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
By all means, this is not how Yoongi envisioned his Saturday morning would go.<br />
<br />
He and Namjoon are sitting across from each other at the dining table, and for the first fifteen minutes, his brain completely zones out, glossing through the details of whatever Namjoon is rambling on about.<br />
<br />
It's too early in the morning and Yoongi hasn't ingested enough caffeine to spark his brain cells to life yet, because a typical weekend for him involves sleeping through breakfast and lunch and only waking up near dusk. He fights to keep his bleary eyes open as each unfamiliar term and law jargon coming from Namjoon's mouth zip right over his head, with the exception of the four words he'd said earlier--yourgrandfatherisdead--replaying in his mind over and over like a broken telecom message.<br />
<br />
It's surreal.<br />
<br />
Yoongi doesn't quite know how to react to this shred of knowledge--grief seems too intimate of a word to feel for someone who's been sorely absent from his life 99% of the time. He didn't even know he had a grandparent who was, well... alive.<br />
<br />
(Well, not anymore, but you know.)<br />
<br />
So he ends up just sitting there listlessly, mouth parted and mind scrambling for a more appropriate response--what do you say to a member of the law enforcement society barging into your house at the asscrack of dawn, bearing news of the death of a long-lost grandfather?<br />
<br />
It's not until Namjoon says something about a &quot;will&quot; and &quot;10 million&quot; and &quot;inheritance&quot;--in that order, respectively--that Yoongi's ears perk up and suddenly he forgets his quenching thirst for coffee because, come on: money? He can talk money.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Yoongi interrupts, blood surging. &quot;What did you just say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Namjoon pauses and looks up from the sheaf of papers that have scattered across the dining table. &quot;Um. That the funeral will take place three days from now, and will last a week--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Yoongi waves a hand in the air, mimicking a rewinding gesture. &quot;Earlier, before that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. The late Yoon Janghyuk has stated in his final will that upon his death, his only grandson Min Yoongi will be entitled to inherit 10 billion won in his name,&quot; Namjoon repeats in one breath.<br />
<br />
Yoongi inhales a staggering breath and sits back, mind racing to string sentences together. Blinking rapidly, he rests a palm across his forehead because--wow. <br />
<br />
Whoa. Since when did he have a filthy rich grandfather? And why did his mother never make a single mention of her family background all throughout Yoongi's growing years? Seriously. A heads-up would've been nice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just say ten billion?&quot; Yoongi says in a whoosh of a breath, feeling dizzy all of a sudden. He pinches the underside of his wrist to make sure he's not having a fancy dream. Ten billion is enough to get him almost anything he wants. A lifetime's worth of bills paid for. He could even move out, if he wants to.<br />
<br />
Namjoon nods. &quot;Ten billion in assets, correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not million. It's more than enough money to sustain him, more than enough to ensure he lives a comfortable life. Yoongi's eyes widen. &quot;Um. Wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
The attorney clears his throat. &quot;Now, as I was saying--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you tell me more about this particular inheritance,&quot; Yoongi can't help himself from cutting in again. &quot;And how one might go about um, procuring it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Namjoon must see right through his bullshit, because he sighs and unlatches his glasses from the bridge of his nose. Using the hem of his sleeve to wipe it clean, he asks in a plaintive tone, &quot;Min Yoongi-ssi, are you perhaps married?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To my job? Hell yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Namjoon chuckles in wry amusement. &quot;Then in that case I might as well say I am, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yoongi's brow creases and he sits forward. &quot;I don't follow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why if you would allow me to elaborate further, I would explain the terms of Yoon Janghyuk's will--&quot;<br />
<br />
A loud crash steals their attention, followed by a hiss. Yoongi turns to where his cat, a Scottish Fold named Madeleine, is stalking out of the bedroom and glaring daggers at the space where Namjoon sits.<br />
<br />
Namjoon groans and buries his head in his hands. &quot;Am I just long-winded, or do people not finish talking in this house?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yoongi stands up and scoops the cat in his arms, stroking her ginger fur in an attempt to tamp down the aggression. &quot;It's okay,&quot; he croons under his breath. &quot;This man won't harm me.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the contrary. Namjoon is the surrogate key to his financial fulfillment.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I was saying.&quot; Namjoon adjusts the glasses back on his nose, and it glints from the late morning sun filtering in through the blinds. &quot;From my observations, you are not married.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shrugging, Yoongi says, &quot;I don't really see where you're going with this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means you won't be able to claim your inheritance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yoongi stops short. &quot;Why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
Namjoon shuffles through his pile of paperwork until he finds the right sheet, and points to a paragraph. &quot;It states here on clause three that...&quot;<br />
<br />
Yoongi leans forward to read along, and his heart plummets.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
iii. Min Yoongi shall inherit all aforementioned assets given the circumstances in which he is bound by legal and credible marriage.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are moments in life where you look out the window and see a glorious landscape just beyond reach, only to stand up and find the door locked from the outside in.<br />
<br />
This is one of them.<br />
<br />
Yoongi's mouth hangs open, and he lets out a tiny disbelieving scoff. &quot;You're kidding me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Namjoon's apologetic smile tells him otherwise, and amidst the dread and dark panic twisting in his gut all Yoongi musters is: &quot;But why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In his final months, your grandfather became a very... sentimental man,&quot; says Namjoon, lowering his gaze. &quot;It's not my place to assume his reasons, but I believe he sincerely wanted to 'make up for all his mistakes' throughout his lifetime. And that includes you and your family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yoongi's mood dampens. He doesn't want to steer the conversation in that direction. With a deep sigh, he asks, &quot;So what happens next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As Mr. Yoon's representing attorney, it is within my power to safekeep the assets at least until you find a spouse,&quot; Namjoon replies. He purses his lips, pushing up the rim of his glasses. &quot;But there's this other clause...&quot;<br />
<br />
Yoongi groans. &quot;Another one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It says that if you are not married within the year, the inheritance will be split among your other relatives.&quot;<br />
<br />
Horror curdles at the pit of Yoongi's stomach. No. There is no way in hell he is letting that happen. He clenches his fists.<br />
<br />
&quot;So since you're not married--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Namjoon raises his eyebrows. &quot;Beg your pardon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I'm not married,&quot; Yoongi affirms dryly. &quot;Not yet, at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
The attorney gives him a curious look, and something stubborn and resolute forms in Yoongi's chest. Truth be told, he has no clue what he's supposed to do from here onwards, but at that moment only one thing matters: he's motherfucking rich now.<br />
<br />
(Sort of.)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's with the long face?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seokjin twists the combination to his locker, and it springs open with a rustic clang. &quot;Wait, no. Don't tell me. Somebody stole your slippers outside your apartment again. Or you're behind on bills. Or... your cat's sick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sighing, Yoongi buttons his navy blue vest over his crisp white collared shirt--basic uniform. No employee at the Blue Rose Jazz Bar is allowed to look &quot;unpresentable&quot;, or so his manager says. Seokjin places a lot of emphasis on first impressions, though it's probably just an elaborate excuse to dress up all fancy to &quot;match the setting's smokey atmosphere&quot;. Whatever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse,&quot; Yoongi mutters.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here I thought you couldn't have possibly looked any gloomier than you usually do. Is Madeleine okay?&quot; Seokjin shakes a can of hairspray. &quot;Why so angsty?&quot;<br />
<br />
If it wasn't already obvious, Yoongi's not the find-someone-and-settle-down type. He keeps it simple. Roof over his head, food on the table, cat in his lap. Never in his twenty-five years of existence did he ever imagine the day would come where he'd lament, &quot;...I need to get married.&quot;<br />
<br />
The jiggling sound of the hairspray can ceases, and the spraying noise stops. Silence hangs between them so loudly that Yoongi hears the rush of the air vents in the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Seokjin is staring at him. &quot;Yoongi. Are you on drugs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're making me sound like a cynic misanthrope hermit crab.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Correction,&quot; Seokjin intercepts, looking like he's finally recovering from the initial shock. &quot;A cynic misanthrope hermit crab who also happens to be a ruthless punctuality snob.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My most redeeming qualities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome.&quot; His manager smooths his gel-slicked hair and shuts his locker. &quot;But that's beside the point. Correct me if I'm wrong, but did I just hear you say the M-word?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yoongi's deadpan stare gives it all away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shocking.&quot; Seokjin emits a low whistle. &quot;I have so many questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I have so many pieces to get through before the night is over.&quot; Yoongi reluctantly puts on the small, fake teal blue rose on his breast pocket--the finishing touch, cherry on top, according to Seokjin--and picks up his sheet music. &quot;That piano's not gonna play itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This conversation is not over!&quot; Seokjin bellows when Yoongi steps through the curtains that lead into the Blue Rose's mini stage. &quot;You have a lot of answering to do!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yoongi only huffs under his breath, then sits on a low, black leather bench in the middle of the wooden stage.<br />
<br />
The first touch of the ivory keys sends his mind to a different realm, and for the first time since the chaos of this morning Yoongi closes his eyes and relaxes completely, losing himself to a medley of Davis and Ellington and Sinatra's bests.<br />
<br />
It's different, with music. Yoongi doesn't have to put on a smile, doesn't have to think, just lets his fingers dance down the piano as if his bones and the keys are made of the same ivory. Playing at the Blue Rose might only be a part-time weekend gig, but it's a sacred window of time to him. Whenever he lets muscle memory take over, playing pianissimo to serve as background ambience, Yoongi allows his gaze to roam while patrons sashay in and out of the underground jazz bar.<br />
<br />
Most of them are regulars, beloved customers who return time and again. There's Jinwoon and Hakyeon, striding in arm-in-arm while exchanging secret smiles only forbidden lovers understand. There's also the Japanese 'benefactor' who always arrives with a different lady each week.<br />
<br />
Most of the faces here are familiar, but occasionally they do get newcomers.<br />
<br />
Like this one.<br />
<br />
The first thing Yoongi notices is his hair--sunburst gold, so effortless in the way each strand swishes this way and that that you'd think it grew out of the guy's head naturally.<br />
<br />
The second thing that grabs Yoongi's attention is the way the young man walks--like the world is a stage and he owns it. He's not that tall; perhaps even the same height as Yoongi, but when he walks it's like the entire room holds it breath and shifts to accommodate his presence. And Yoongi's not the type of guy to be fazed by first impressions, but when the young man looks up and catches him staring, his heart tumbles backwards and Yoongi ends up pressing the wrong key at the wrong time.<br />
<br />
What comes out of the piano is a pathetic, off-beat, wrong note.<br />
<br />
Grimacing, Yoongi rips his gaze away and focus back on the music--lest he get fired for messing up such a simple piece--but his senses are hyper aware of which booth Blondie chooses to sit, and Yoongi is (pleasantly) surprised to realize that it's at the table 2 meters across him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Focus, Min Yoongi.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's just another attractive stranger. That's it. No need to lose his wits over one face. Yoongi takes a deep breath and forces his eyes to stay low on the keys, even though they're itching to stray back to where he sits.<br />
<br />
The guy's probably taken anyway.<br />
<br />
And... surprise surprise, he's not wrong.<br />
<br />
Because not more than ten minutes later, a man built like bricks strides into the club like a bulldozer, nearly colliding into a poor waiter before sliding into the booth to press a sloppy kiss to Blondie's cheek.<br />
<br />
Yoongi purses his lips.<br />
<br />
A smile blossoms across Blondie's face, and he leans in to whisper into his boyfriend's ear.<br />
<br />
Yoongi averts his gaze. They're always taken, at the end of the day. Disappointed but not surprised.<br />
<br />
The rest of the night blurs by. He may or may not have slammed the piano too hard. It even gets to the point where Seokjin waltzes past where Yoongi's piano pedestal stands, whispering surreptitiously behind his hand, &quot;Tone down the angst a bit, won't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Only when Yoongi reaches the second-to-the-last song of the night does the chaos ensue.<br />
<br />
Don't get him wrong, it's not like he was deliberately eavesdropping. It's just kind of hard not to listen when two people start a screeching match two feet away from you. It's also hard not to look, because as much as Yoongi hates disruption in his life, he can't say he hates witnessing drama. He's a busybody like that.<br />
<br />
Look but don't meddle: that's his personal policy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're what?&quot; he hears Blondie exclaim, high-pitched and petulant.<br />
<br />
The guy next to him--his boyfriend, Yoongi presumes--lets out a string of hurried murmurs that he can't hear, but the next thing he knows, Blondie is dropping a string of loud curses left and right as if he's beatboxing each word. Then he picks up a wine glass and dumps its cherry-red liquid contents into his boyfriend's face.<br />
<br />
Yoongi has to remind his fingers not to seize up while playing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jimin, wait. Babe--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't ever call me that,&quot; Blondie snaps, eyes red with outrage. &quot;Especially not when you've been engaged this whole fucking time, Choi Sungjoon. How gracious of you to only inform me now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Behind the piano, Yoongi's eyes widen and his jaw drops. Well, damn.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we can always keep this up, you know?&quot; argues the asshole, which has Jimin's hand smacking the side of his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't make me your side project,&quot; Jimin bites out, and Yoongi can't help but press each key faster, speeding up the tempo to somehow accompany this tension.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what,&quot; Jimin spits out, intentionally making his voice ring out across the entire bar. &quot;And this bar is my witness. You're getting married next month? Well, Choi Sungjoon, guess what.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears are welling up in his eyes--Yoongi can see the breakdown from 50 yards away.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can get married, then so can I,&quot; Jimin continues, his voice breathy and cracking at the end. &quot;I swear I will marry the first man I run into, from now on. Just you fucking wait and see, dirtbag.&quot;<br />
<br />
At his words, Yoongi's hands pause, hovering over the piano keys.<br />
<br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
<br />
He swears he's hearing things. He must be getting desperate, and the prospect of inheriting ten billion won is messing with his perception. Yoongi doesn't get to ponder this over, because the next moment, Jimin picks up his things and scoots out of his booth seat unceremoniously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jimin, wait--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no right,&quot; Jimin half-growls, half-whimpers. &quot;You have no right to-- oh!&quot;<br />
<br />
At the last moment, Jimin trips over one side of the table leg jutting out of the booth, and he falls, almost in slow motion...<br />
<br />
...and barrels face-first into Yoongi's chest.<br />
<br />
Later, Yoongi will regret sliding out of the safety of his piano bench and acting before thinking. Later, he'll question what the hell could've gotten into him for being so brash and bold and dumb.<br />
<br />
Right now though, as he holds this wide-eyed stranger steady, all he rasps out is a low, despairing, &quot;Hi. Will you marry me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Park Jimin is no stranger to proposals.<br />
<br />
At the prime, tender age of twenty-three years young, he's already amassed a suite of impromptu confessions and wedding offers that sits at the back of his mind like a row of trophies left to collect dust on a shelf. Ego fluffers, each one of them.<br />
<br />
He's aware of his charisma, knows how to work his gait and facial expressions to his advantage. Park Jimin is no stranger to the world of proposals, but in his twenty-three years of life, never has he been on the receiving end of one from a random stranger out of the blue.<br />
<br />
Yet here he is now, red-cheeked and tear-streaked, staring into the deep brown eyes of a guy whose hair is the color of midnight on a rainy evening, and all Jimin can think is: Who the hell asks for a hand in marriage in place of a simple 'hello'?<br />
<br />
That, but also a panicked: Not here. Not now.<br />
<br />
Because this is not how this particular scenario was supposed to go. He was supposed to make a clean exit, leave Sungjoon in the bar and paint him as a huge thirsty asshat. Just like they'd agreed.<br />
<br />
Stricken, Jimin's mouth freezes momentarily as he grapples for a reaction. &quot;Um.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy in front of him blinks, and he seems to catch a hold of his actions,  because then he releases Jimin's elbows and steps back with a mortified bow. &quot;M-my bad. I didn't--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh,&quot; Jimin shushes, feeling like his brain is disassembling itself, hyper aware of the eyes on them. The ambient chatter inside the jazz bar has lowered to a stunned silence, and Jimin's instincts scream for him to flee, bring this outside. Someone has interrupted his little performance, waltzed into his stage without his permission. Unacceptable.<br />
<br />
Before the guy can stutter more, Jimin grasps him by the shoulders and pushes, pushes, pushes him up past the flight of stairs that lead up to ground level, wheeling the stranger out into the fresh, open air.<br />
<br />
The guy stammers a slew of baffled protests, but Jimin is not having it. &quot;Do you know what you've just done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I acted without thinking--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You nearly blew it.&quot; Jimin fumes as he turns to pin the stranger down with a harsh glower. Granted, he'd managed to pull off the ruse well, had shed the most convincing crocodile tears he could, but still. &quot;I almost broke character!&quot;<br />
<br />
Black Haired Dude stares dumbly at him. &quot;Uh. What are you- I'm lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimin glances behind his shoulder, scanning for possible eavesdroppers, before stepping close to the guy--and wow, it's not everyday he meets a cutie whose height matches his for perfect kissing range--to whisper:<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen. Everything you saw there? Was staged, but between you and me, let's say it was all completely and wholly true.&quot; The words slip past Jimin's mouth without filter, and at the back of his mind he wonders why the hell he's divulging Top Secret Matters to a random stranger.<br />
<br />
Two weeks ago, his high school friend Sungjoon pinged him on KakaoTalk to share his miserable story of woe--that he, a gym instructor, has gathered himself some rabid admirers who've turned into stalkers over time.<br />
<br />
And Park Jimin, theatre graduate, had agreed to help shake them off. After all, he's built quite a steady repertoire, being everyone's go-to contact person when it comes to fooling people for blind. Their little sly conman, able to pull off any believable act without breaking a sweat.<br />
<br />
Which brings them to this night with Operation Make Sungjoon Unavailable, and the whole time Jimin was already priding himself on being such a talented actor that Sungjoon's nasty fans from two tables over started sporting horrified expressions at their little spat.<br />
<br />
Until this guy.<br />
<br />
This guy was not a part of the plan at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;And to answer your question,&quot; Jimin quips curtly, carding a hand through his hair out of habit. In the autumn air, his breath comes out in white puffs of mist. &quot;No, I won't marry you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Black Haired Dude blanches at his words. &quot;It's fine. It's not like I expected--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, please,&quot; Jimin continues with a laugh. &quot;I know I'm pretty, but marriage? Right away? Isn't that taking it a little too far? I don't even know you, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And honestly. I'm too good for you. So no thanks, I'm staying single.&quot;<br />
<br />
The apologetic shine in the guy's eyes diminishes into something resembling affront. &quot;Wait,&quot; he says slowly. &quot;So... you weren't heartbroken?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, he's catching on!&quot; Jimin claps his hands together and gives Black Haired Dude a pity-pat on the shoulder, grinning for no reason. Maybe he's tipsy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, it's a flattering offer, mister, but no.&quot; Jimin pastes on the sickly sweet smile he always uses in front of his friends' mothers. &quot;I'm not that cheap.&quot;<br />
<br />
He spins to leave, but hears at the last moment:<br />
<br />
&quot;But it all seemed so real.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimin chuckles, congratulating himself for fooling every last person in that bar. &quot;Honey, that's just called acting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just when I thought you were finally doing something cool in your life, you come strutting back in here looking like a wet kitten,&quot; Seokjin remarks the moment Yoongi steps back inside the Blue Rose's staff locker room. <br />
<br />
Yoongi drops into a chair and buries his face in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do me a favor, won't you?&quot; he says, feeling like... like gum stuck to the sole of a shoe. Small and dirty and all things unnecessary. &quot;Just put me on like. Stocking duty next week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those fingers are for piano-ing, not appliance-checking&quot; comes Seokjin's lightning-fast reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though I could definitely think of a lot more uses for long fingers.&quot; He waggles his eyebrows suggestively.<br />
<br />
Any other time, Yoongi would have rolled his eyes, maybe even laughed if he's in a particularly good mood. But now he just sighs, sniffles and looks down at the floor.<br />
<br />
Never has he ever felt such magnitude of humiliation before. Yoongi's comfort zone lies in staying within the sidelines, watching life pass him by. He's not quite sure what stings more: that he's made a fool out of putting himself out there, or that he just got brutally rejected.<br />
<br />
He hears footsteps drawing near, and when he looks up he finds Seokjin looming over him, arms crossed. &quot;Min Yoongi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmph.&quot; Yoongi doesn't look up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; Seokjin asks. &quot;First you tell me you need to get married, and now you're proposing to strangers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yoongi sighs again, the words 'Ten billion dollars' bouncing back and forth in his mind like a pinball.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, what am I supposed to expect now?&quot; Seokjin carries on. &quot;Next thing I know, you'll be taking off to become a rap star, or that you're training to be a monk. Bald and--&quot;<br />
<br />
The noise of the walk-in freezer's door interrupts Seokjin's monologue, and Taehyung's teal blue-dyed head pops out, eyes wide and curious. &quot;Did anything happen while I was inside?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seokjin sends him a pointed look. &quot;You missed out. Yoongi proposed to a stranger just now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way.&quot; The younger waiter's mouth falls open. &quot;Everything always happens when I'm on freezer duty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, it's not a very Yoongi thing to do,&quot; Seokjin singsongs, talking about Yoongi as if he's not right there sitting in the same room.<br />
<br />
Taehyung nods. &quot;There's an ulterior motive. There's always one with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead. Ask him why. My bet is: he's high.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not high, or drunk, or whatever the hell you're thinking,&quot; Yoongi defends himself before launching into a brief recap of everything that happened since this morning. When he finishes, Taehyung goes quiet while Seokjin bursts out laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you need to find a wife--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or a husband,&quot; Yoongi adds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or a husband, just for the sake of claiming your money from a grandfather you've never met?&quot; Seokjin asks, leaning against the side of the lockers. &quot;Either you're a lucky bastard, or this is a scam.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The attorney himself explained it to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yoongi isn't about to let his manager's skepticism dampen his already rotten mood. &quot;It's the real thing, hyung. This is my ticket to paradise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seokjin studies him for a moment, trying to gauge just how serious he is about this. &quot;Well. Do you want me to set up a blind date?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yoongi swallows. Him, meet new people? Make attempts at flirting and get them interested in marriage? He might as well scale the Pyramids of Giza. He scratches his head. &quot;No need. Thing is, I'm not really interested in the whole falling in love shit. No time for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seokjin shrugs and weaves through the curtains to return to the Blue Rose's main floor. &quot;Suit yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the wake of his manager's departure, Yoongi sags against his locker, thoughts in a jumble. What now?<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
He glances up to find Taehyung pacing back and forth in front of, eyes glinting with something either utterly brilliant or utterly ridiculous. Yoongi knows that look: the trademark Scheming Face. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're just getting married, hyung,&quot; Taehyung says casually. &quot;It's not like you have to love them, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Squinting his eyes, Yoongi says, &quot;I don't know where you're going with this, but that face is giving me bad idea vibes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the face of a genius at work,&quot; Taehyung chides in mock offense. &quot;Learn the difference, hyung.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you forget when you suggested we should name our cocktails after sex terms?&quot; Yoongi fires.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Flaming Orgasm is iconic! And the customers love them!&quot; Taehyung cries, before rearranging his face in a placating smile. &quot;Anyway. Trust me on this. Because I think I might know just the perfect person for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yoongi can spot a Bad Idea from a mile away, and it's safe to say that this one is already giving him an ominous feeling. &quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
Taehyung smiles, looking genuinely pleased with himself. &quot;A friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When Jimin gets home later that night, he hardly makes it past the first flight of stairs leading into his [rented] apartment complex when his spots his belongings--his clothes, his sheets, his books, his suitcase--dumped outside the main entrance like a pile of garbage.<br />
<br />
!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Letting out a small cry, he rushes forward and picks up his dirtied laundry, trying to gather every last item in his arms. What the hell is going on? Jimin has half a mind to storm into the apartment and knock on the landlady's front door--<br />
<br />
&quot;Park Jimin!&quot; comes a shrill shriek.<br />
<br />
Jimin freezes mid-scramble. Looks like there's no need to go looking.<br />
<br />
Straightening his spine, he turns around to come face to face with who else but his landlady--a short, middle-aged woman in a pale nightdress that makes her look sickly green.<br />
<br />
But that's not the worst of it.<br />
<br />
Jimin suppresses a horrified gasp when he sees a triangular bald spot on the crown of her head, which was definitely not there the last time he'd seen her. &quot;H-hi, Mrs. Kwon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You dare show your face in my premises?&quot; Mrs. Kwon sneers, raising a hanger in the air, and Jimin feels like he's twelve years old again, running away from his mother's ass whooping after accidentally breaking her favorite flower vase. &quot;Huh? After what you did--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Kwon!&quot; Jimin cries as he inches backwards. &quot;I-isn't it a lovely night? Perfect for some... um. Relaxation? Yoga?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yoga, my ass!&quot; Mrs. Kwon screeches, eyes livid. &quot;Relaxing is the last thing on my mind right now. I've lost so much hair, you filthy scoundrel, all because of you, and now I'm balding even more because of stress!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimin can only flash what he hopes is a remorseful expression as he kneels on the gravel. &quot;I'm so, so sorry--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're only sorry you got caught, rat,&quot; his landlady interjects, face red, nostrils flaring. She points at her half-shorn head. &quot;And you're paying for all this damage, eh? I'm going to court and slamming your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimin gasps. &quot;But I don't have- I just graduated from university!&quot; In other words: broke.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I care? Get out. And never come back unless you're settling for my damages and your overdue rent.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that is how Jimin finds himself hauling his ass down the streets of metropolitan Seoul, lugging around two suitcases, one grocery bag of leftover takeout food, and a backpack weighing heavy on his shoulders, cursing himself for his terrible circumstances that he can't exactly not blame himself for, all because--<br />
<br />
&quot;You sold what to your landlady?&quot; Taehyung chokes through a mouthful of bibimbap, and Jimin pushes a cup of cold water towards his best friend.<br />
<br />
Jimin clucks his tongue. &quot;Some homemade hair products.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taehyung gives him a pointed look. &quot;Homemade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, fine. It was just a little bit of... leg wax.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leg. Fucking. Wax.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Small doses! And it wasn't even obvious!&quot; Jimin cries indignantly, cheeks puffed into a pout. &quot;Plus, I designed that purple uniform on the bottle!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jiminie, Chimchim, Jimbo,&quot; Taehyung says, putting his chopsticks down. &quot;Breathe, man. Loosen those shoulders. It's not good for your blood pressure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimin lets out a breath he didn't even know he'd been bottling up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you're quite the entrepreneur, but... okay. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimin stabs his rice bowl with a spoon. &quot;The grind never stops, Tae. You know I can't let my family know how it's really like for me here.&quot; After all the fuss he'd made back in Busan to go out and find 'better acting opportunities' in Seoul, he can't quit now. No turning back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't you say you were waiting for Big Apple Performing Group to get back to you with audition results?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimin gasps, eyes blowing wide, and he scrambles for his phone. &quot;Shit, that was today. Thanks for reminding me.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few swipes and taps later, he pulls up the email alert from his dream company. Jimin's heart pounds in his ears as he scrolls through the list of names scheduled for a callback, only for his chest to deflate when he reaches the end of the webpage and--<br />
<br />
&quot;My name's not here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taehyung gives an empathetic sigh. &quot;Better luck next time--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no next time,&quot; Jimin says, heart sinking, swallowing down the lump forming in his throat. Big Apple only has yearly intakes. &quot;At least, not until next year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you have a year to keep improving yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Got a job for you,&quot; Weasel says as soon as Wade picks up the phone, no preamble.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay!&quot; Wade squeals, way too much falsetto for this early in the morning. &quot;What's it pay? Is it fun? Who's the client?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nada, nope, and me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whaaaat? I'll give you the bestie discount.  Comrade Coupon? Main Man Markdown ? Nah, now I'm trying too hard. Anyway, what do you need me to do? Did someone cheat you outta somethin'? Do they need to die or just a booty beatin'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it - wait, booty beatin'?&quot; Weasel is sickened and amused, as he often is while talking to Wade. &quot;Fuck, man, just say ass kicking, what is wrong with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know how much is wrong with me, it's just rude to ask me to make a list when you  know  how I feel about lists. I was just trying something new.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's kind of funny, but Weasel is obligated to give Wade a hard time about everything.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a beanie baby is going around committing adorable yet disturbing violence, and no one wants that, Wade. Not a single person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? You can't think of  anyone  that might be into that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel leans against the stainless steel prep table, thoughtful.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe someone with some kind of yandere-agalmato-guro fetish, but you're distracting me from my original point, damn you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right! Your job! Who do I gotta take care of?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;The dishes,&quot; Weasel glances at the pile of them, then clarifies. &quot;At Hellhouse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Wade is quiet for several seconds, then sounds way too chipper to be taking this seriously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haveta say, I wasn't expecting that, so A plus for taking my breath away! But I'm also going to have to hard pass. I barely even do my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come  on ,&quot; Weasel whines at him, hoping he can annoy him into submission. It's worked once or twice, but dishes were a Big Ask. &quot;Matteo straight up died on the floor last night in the middle of washing them. I just found him this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, man, Matteo? Not  Matteo! &quot; Wade cries loudly enough that Weasel has to hold the phone away from his ear. &quot;He was one of the...okay, kinda shitty ones. Great dishwasher though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, so so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;He still there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; Weasel confirms, still not happy about having to deal with rude-ass, nosy cops first thing in the morning. His Irish Coffee hadn't even kicked in yet. &quot;They're putting him in a bodybag soon but he's still there. Just...just  looking  at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;God, they didn't even close his eyes?  Brutal . Ooh, put him on the phone. I wanna say goodbye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not doing that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair. I'll just yell then. Hold the receiver out for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Receiver? The fuck? This is a smart phone, you animal. And I'm still not doing that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're no fun,&quot; Wade pouts. &quot;Since when were you no fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty sure yelling at corpses isn't my idea of fun. At least not sober.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're standing next to a dead body while calling me in to replace him. Not sure yelling at him is much of a stretch,&quot; Wade tells him lightly, not sounding at all insulted. He never quite does, even when Weasel tries. &quot;And let's not pretend you don't have whiskey in your hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Touche.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,  weeeell , good luck with your dishes and toodle -&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot; Wade ,&quot; Weasel groans, not above vying for pity. &quot;My hands are way too dainty for this job. Yours are disgusting, and you'll heal up like you never had to touch old, wet, leftover food.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, flattery!&quot; Wade chirps, and he doesn't even sound sarcastic even though he must be, the bastard. &quot;Just hire someone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before tonight? We open in five hours!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I better let you get to it then,&quot; Wade says, flat and low to show how much he means it. Fuck, that really means he's not going to do it. Weasel shouldn't have gotten out of bed today.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?&quot; He complains, &quot;You're just going to leave me to deal with this but you'd have murdered someone for me at the drop of a ballsack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sometimes making Wade laugh helps his situation. The guy is crazy and acts on sudden whims more often than not, so Weasel can only hope.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good one!&quot; Wade encourages him, the vocal equivalent of finger guns. &quot;Yeah, my good dude, I'm not doing your dead guy dishes. Gross.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You,&quot; Weasel says miserably. &quot;are a terrible friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, I love you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Wade hangs up.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For the next several minutes, Weasel is left to figure out how Craigslist works. As a criminal, he thinks he should be better at traversing sites like this, but he hadn't been able to sell that lamp six years ago either, so. He should have just done it on his computer, because on his phone he's too lazy to correct his spelling or capitalize properly. It's pretty creepy and scammy by the time he submits it, but he figures that he needs someone desperate enough to apply for the position.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He adds ' not a scam. Immediate hire .' to the end of it before hitting submit, then tries to get the rest of his opening tasks done, just in case he really does have to do them all himself.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
While considering the pros and cons of just letting his customers drink out of dirty glasses - he's pretty sure the vast majority won't give a shit - he hears someone call out from the bar. He reaches for his gun just in case, but it becomes clear as soon as he peers through the window in the kitchen door that there's no need for it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The voice sounds exactly as young as the kid looks. Weasel steps out and lets the door swing shut after him, looking him over, incredulously. He looks so out of place in this bar, even when it's empty, it's ridiculous, from his windswept brown hair to his slight build and big doe eyes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The fuck.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who - how did you get in here?&quot; Weasel demands, looking toward the door, half blaming it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, the front door,&quot; the stranger says, which makes Weasel blame it the other half of the way, even though he knows it must be Bob's doing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; He huffs out, &quot;No way, Patch would never let someone like you in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like I should be insulted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel ignores him and starts for the door, shouting, &quot;Hey, Patch! Patch, what the -&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn't let me in!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The loud protest cuts him off mid stride. Weasel hates today. He doesn't want to do this. He didn't ask for his dishwasher to die or for his best friend to suck balls or for this literal child to sneak in here. He didn't even really ask to move to New York, but here he is.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He rolls his eyes then turns around, more than a little exasperated.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You  just  said -&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; repeats the kid, &quot;I said I came in through the front door.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're being deliberately evasive. I mean, bravo, you don't look like you have it in you, but seriously, what are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm here for the job,&quot; kid says simply.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is someone like you answering a weird-ass ad like that? It should have been  hair-raising  to most people, kid. Have you no survival instinct? I barely even tried! That was such a murder-y scam ad, I'm ashamed I wrote it, but I was kind of trying to attract murder-y people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It said ' not  a scam',&quot; kid shrugs, &quot;Seemed too obvious. Don't most scams try to be tricky about it? Besides, I can take care of myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, no, I'm going to give Patch a piece of my mind for letting you in here, and then I'm going to kick you out. Or, I guess I should kick you out first,&quot; Weasel decides, &quot;C'mon then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn't! Really! I tried to get in through him, but he said this place wasn't for me,&quot; kid has the decency to look a little sheepish, but it just makes him look younger. &quot;so I snuck passed him when he wasn't looking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Patch doesn't usually leave his post,&quot; Weasel tells him, suspicious but also ready to tear Patch a new one. This isn't the day to slack on security. Fuch, can today just go away?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn't. I'm just,&quot; kid shrugs. &quot;I have a high stealth score, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice Dungeons and Dragons reference, but don't think that means I'll consider hiring you. Weirdly sneaky, okay. We'll circle back around to that,&quot; Weasel says, narrowing his eyes and reassessing. &quot;How did you even get here so fast? I put the ad up like, twenty minutes ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have an alert on my phone for new jobs, and I live nearby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You? Looking like that, around  here ?&quot; Weasel scoffs. &quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; kid looks down at himself, tugging on the bottom of his button-down shirt. Did he really wear a dress shirt to a dishwasher interview? For fuck's sake. &quot;What's wrong with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Literally nothing,&quot; Weasel grouses. &quot;Which means you can't work here, kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why?&quot; kid demands, looking hurt, of all things. Seriously, what. &quot;You haven't even asked me any questions yet!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty sure I interrogated you, actually,&quot; Weasel disagrees, already starting back behind the bar, hoping this whole thing will be over with soon.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He has so much shit to do. He doesn't need this, talking to innocent people takes so much work.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They have feelings, that they  express .<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ugh.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I meant like, job interview questions! You know, 'what are your strengths and weaknesses?' or 'where do you see yourself in five years?',&quot; kid waves his hands around to demonstrate that he feels like something that should be here is missing. &quot;You're an employer, you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;As much as I need to fill this position, I  really  don't think you want this job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Emphatically, kid states more firmly, standing straighter.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise you, I  do .&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guarantee you, you  don't,  &quot; Weasel says, raising his voice and making shooing motions with his hands. He kind of enjoys the kid's humor, but he'll never survive. It's really a kindness that Weasel is getting rid of him now. Like one of those dog movies. &quot;So go on. Scram. Come on,   get! &quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure I get what's happening, but I still want the job,&quot; He takes a deep breath, which makes it seem like he's just gearing up for a whole  thing.  &quot;My name is Peter Parker, and I'm -&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope!&quot; Weasel is a breath away from plugging his ears and saying 'la la la' as loudly as he possibly can. &quot;C'mon, no  names!   Do you even know what kind of place this   is ?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kid - Peter,  shit  - looks around, taking everything in.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;The kind of place that hires felons?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot; Exactly  , which is why I can't possibly, in good conscience, hire some nubile slave boy to hang around all the riff raff. You gotta get that,&quot; Weasel straightens his glasses and shakes his head. &quot;This place is for sewer rats, not   chipmunks .&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm  not  a -&quot; Peter seems to think better for the petulant rebuttal that was turning out to be. &quot;Listen. I'm stronger than I look and I'm a hard worker.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Simon, off you get.&quot; Weasel sighs, this time holding his arm out, palm up, and holding it out like that in the direction of the door. It looks like a lopsided Heil Hitler, which makes him feel slightly guilty, but he's already feeling that way so why the fuck not.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter raises his eyebrows. &quot;Wouldn't Alvin be more relevant?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a basic bitch,&quot; Weasel lets his arm fall, then he gestures at Peter instead. &quot;Plus, you're clearly the nerdy one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not even wearing my glasses!&quot; Peter bristles, but only slightly, like it's in good humor. Aw shit, that's not good. Weasel should have dragged him out by his ear way sooner.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot; He finds himself saying, a little too triumphantly. &quot;So you do wear glasses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot; You're  wearing glasses!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see your point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because of you're nearsightedness?&quot; Peter asks pointedly, a little smirk forming on his lips as he leans forward. He even guessed right. &quot;So maybe you can 'not see the problem' with hiring me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like your sass, kid,&quot; Weasel admits grudgingly, crossing his arms.&quot;but I'm still not hiring you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter stares at him hard for a moment, looking for something in Weasel's face that might indicate he's changeable. Weasel's too good for that; his expression stays hard and unmoving.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine!&quot; He spreads his arms in a sharp, wide motion. &quot;At least sign this then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He digs in his back pocket and beings to approach the bar.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't sign things,&quot; Weasel tells him, holding both hands up as Peter hops onto a barstool and spreads out a previously folded document.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter purses his lips briefly. &quot;The  least  you can do if you're not giving me a job is sign my paperwork so I can tell my parole officer that I've been trying, alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The  fuck.  Weasel's brain does the equivalent of tires shrieking to a halt.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your -&quot; He chokes a bit, sure his eyes are bulging. &quot;Your  what? &quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter looks confused, then embarrassed, flushing a little. &quot;Did you not get it when I said that thing about hiring felons? You seem quicker than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel rears back, doing a double take.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You, went to  prison. You,   looking like   that. &quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel feels like he might have a heart attack. He is suddenly, aggressively,  retroactively   worried for this poor guy. The damage is done now, of course, but he's pretty sure prison would fuck   him  up pretty bad, and he's twice this kid's size and all...hairy and weird.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't change the way I look, so yeah,&quot; Peter looks uncomfortable, shifty-eyed. &quot;I wasn't there for long, just six months, so it wasn't too -&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Motherfuck, are you like,  okay  ?&quot; Weasel can't get over it. &quot;  Look  at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you stop gesturing at me like I'm - God.&quot; Peter huffs out a frustrated breath, steadily growing pinker. &quot;I'm obviously fine, alright? I just need a job, and if you're not going to give me one -&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Right, of course. Weasel needs to sign is little chaperone paper slip or whatever. Because of parol stuff. Because this slip of a thing with big brown eyes went did fuckin'  time,   holy hell, the world really is going to shit. Weasel kind of knew it, but now he's pretty sure he   knows it  knows it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, how are you standing here right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He really doesn't mean to make that big of a deal of it. He feels like his whole 'make it a joke until it feels less tragic' thing is glitching in his head. Maybe he needs to eat something. The dead body first thing in the morning had meant he'd delayed breakfast and then gotten busy and then...this.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter's face is impressively deadpan even though his ears are still rosy.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;With my feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hardy har har har,&quot; Weasel says, trying to snap out of it. Jesus. He might as well get comfortable, if he's seriously going to consider this. Not that he is. Damn it. &quot;I guess I should introduce myself if we're getting fucking deep with this shit. Name's Weasel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Suits you,&quot; Peter tells him, mouth twitching.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, right?&quot; Weasel says. &quot;What were you in for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Drugs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The answer is quick and full of bravado.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Felony charge?&quot; Weasel whistles, tapping his chin thoughtfully. &quot;Nice white boy like you? Must be poor as fuck. And of had enough to sell. That part could be useful -&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot; No  ,&quot; Peter cuts him off firmly,  glowering down at the table, &quot;I wasn't. It wasn't like that. I've never done drugs in my life. Well, except some for my ADHD when I was younger, but that's been a while. I've definitely   never  sold them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel feels a little sick to his stomach at the wave of deja vu that hits him. It feels like another life, years ago when almost the same exact thing happened at him at Oscorp. The reason life led him down the road to Hellhouse in the first place. He was lucky that he'd changed his name and gone underground before he'd been arrested, because prison would have been shit for him.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Though, maybe not as bad as it had most likely been for Peter. God, he needs a nap.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're saying you were innocent,&quot; he clarifies, voice a lot jauntier than he feels. That's something both he and Wade are good at.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Peter glances up and then back to the surface of the bar. &quot;That's what I'm saying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel regards him for another moment, before blowing air out through his mouth, letting his lips flap audibly as he does so.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Shit, kid, that sucks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You,&quot; Peter looks up, eyes even wider. &quot;you believe me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I believe you!&quot; Weasel gestures again. &quot;Have you  seen  you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This time Peter looks vaguely amused. &quot;You keep saying that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You look like Harry Potter and Hermione Granger had a bastard child who knocked up a Disney Princess and your the beloved yet tragically cursed golden child that the whole ass animated kingdom adores. Do you have an adorable familiar? Can you turn into a dove, by any chance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter snorts. &quot;No, that would be pretty cool, but...no, I can't do any of that. Wow, you really have a way with words. I'm pretty sure I don't look like all that, but thanks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really a compliment,&quot; Weasel shrugs.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks anyway,&quot; Peter tells him, sliding the paper Weasel's supposed to sign toward him a bit.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's so earnest that it gives Weasel gas. Yeah, that's why his stomach aches so bad.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same thing happened to me,&quot; Weasel tells him, stalling and hating himself for it. Fuck, is he really about to do this? Why is he  sharing?  &quot;Believe it or not. One day I was on my way to get somewhere and the next day I was in No Man's Land. I get why they thought I did it. I know I look like a chubby squirrel that's trying real hard to fit in but also might Peter Pettigrew the fuck out of you when your back is turned. But you? Did they learn nothing from Order of the Phoenix?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter blinks a few times, and even though he hesitates, appraising Weasel carefully, it's stupid how he obviously believes him. Why wouldn't he? When Weasel extended him the same courtesy. That's what his guileless expression seems to say. Disgusting. He'll never make it. Weasel knows he should just put the poor kid out of his misery, sign the paper and let him go.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What is  wrong  with him? Maybe he just really doesn't want to do those dishes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yeah, that seems the most likely.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure my judge read Harry Potter,&quot; Peter answers after a moment. &quot;or if he did, the lessons went over his head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel taps his fingers anxiously on the countertop, near the pen, eyeing the paper briefly.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He ignores it, against his better judgement, and groans.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you really know the kind of place this is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I read a little about it, &quot;Peter says, leaning forward, eyes brighter now. He's acknowledged the second chance and jumped on it. &quot;Weren't you in San Francisco before? What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;The earthquake happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kid looks like he fucking means it too, the absolute shit.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You the sucker behind climate change? Thought you'd be taller. Meaner, at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no,&quot; Peter laughs. &quot;I was studying bioengineering, before prison, so the political sabotage of environmental science wasn't really on my itinerary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Computer science, myself. I'm sure I could have predicted storms eventually, but you know, someone planted drugs on me, so I had different things to use my big brain for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel pours himself another glass of whiskey as he talks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I guess it's both our faults.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot; Ha . Yeah, well. New York seemed like a good place to remake ourselves. Plenty of work here, even more now thanks to our dickwit supreme leader. Barely a squabble over territory, in fact.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
One guy had died, but he'd been an asshole anyway. Weasel considers it a win. At least for now - but that's all there ever was in this business. All wins were temporary wins.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Lucky you, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;More like unlucky you,&quot; Weasel answers,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He asks for Peter's drink.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kid doesn't even try to get a beer, seeming pleased enough about a Ginger Ale. Of course he doesn't. They sit in quiet for a moment, drinking their respective beverages.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After a few sips, Weasel asks, &quot;...You sure this is where you want to work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Peter sighs. &quot;but I've been looking for weeks. The only other places that will hire me pay next to nothing, and I have someone to protect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh, boy, Jesus. I'm going to forget you ever said that,&quot; Weasel closes his eyes briefly. &quot;That's not something you want to tell people if you're going to work in a place like this, holy shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...If I'm going to work here,&quot; Peter repeats, brightening. &quot;Does that mean I'm hired?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get that adorable expression off your face,&quot; Weasel brandishes a pointed finger at him sternly. &quot;we're not done negotiating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we  are   negotiating,&quot; Peter grins. &quot;so that means you   are  considering me for the position.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't look so smug, kid. You look like a fucking mouse who just got a chunk of cheese out of the trap without getting maimed, and I'm not here to be charmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I'm so charming then,&quot; Peter says, mockingly sage. &quot;What are we negotiating, hours, pay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, neither of those are negotiable. You work while we're open, every day but Monday, and for as long as there are dishes to clean. You get paid twenty an hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's -&quot; Peter's eyes flicker wide but he catches himself. &quot;Um, better than I was expecting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perks of working with criminals. Which you will be, you have to understand that. You're not signing a confidentiality agreement, you just don't say shit if you want to live. That's not me threatening you, that's just what I know will happen. Nasty folk come in here all the time and say nasty things,&quot; Weasel pauses to sip, &quot;I'm one of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter tilts his head slightly. &quot;You don't seem so bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Aw, shucks. Weasel finishes his glass of whiskey and pours himself enough as the other settles warmly in the pit of his stomach.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I want to talk about how you got in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel raises a hand before he can respond anymore. &quot;I don't want to know how you did it. If you're a mutant or some shit, I cannot impress upon you how much I do  not want to know. &quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter looks baffled. &quot;Okaaay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot; All   I want to know is if you can do it again,&quot; Weasel says, the drink in his hand dipping and swaying as he talks. &quot;Was it a fluke, or are you   always  good at getting around without being seen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter hesitates, as he should.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I'm putting on a musical and thought you might want to move the props around in the dark, thought it might be a real hoot,&quot; Weasel intones. &quot;Why the hell do you think? I'm shady ass dude. That kind of skill is useful to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter frowns. &quot;I don't want to do anything illegal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Somehow I gathered that. I won't ask you to do anything that could land you back in prison, because as I mentioned, I  don't know how you made it out of there. &quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter glares, mouth tight.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel goes on, offering, &quot;We could pay by the job, depending on the difficulty. Twenty to fifty bucks, couple times a week maybe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know about -&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot; Or , you can make yourself available to pass messages along during all of our working hours, whenever I need, and I'll double your hourly pay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter looks positively  stricken.  Weasel takes another long sip, waiting.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's...yeah, that's really hard to turn down,&quot; Peter confesses, fingers fidgeting.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know,&quot; Weasel nods, &quot;This is why you don't people that someone you love needs you. I know that giving you a dependable raise so you know what you're taking home every week will entice you more than an occasional bonus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you were forgetting about that,&quot; Peter mumbles.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;First lesson?&quot; Weasel does the 'cheers' motion with his glass. &quot;We lie. We don't forget anything, but it does often benefit us to pretend to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I got that,&quot; Peter says, looking a bit  too  dejected as he considers his options. It's kind of unbearable, and Weasel hates his life.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, listen,&quot; Weasel exhales heavily. &quot;I'm not unmoved by your plight, kid. I'm giving you an opportunity, but you don't have to take it. You can just wash dishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He has the audacity to chew his lip, clearly uncertain.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...That's a lot of money for something that isn't illegal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel barks a laugh. &quot;Oh, no. No, no, no, nononono, nope, no. Kid. Buddy. Pal. You would fall out of your chair if I told you what you'd make if it I wanted you to do something illegal. But you aren't interested in that kind of job. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Weasel agrees, reminding himself as he does so. &quot;It's decent pay because it might be dangerous for you, but that depends on how good you think you'll be at it. Again, I don't want to know how you do it. It's like... passing notes in class. I'm not going to lie to you. The information might be sensitive, and you might not like what it says if you peek. Don't peek. Plausible deniability. That's the only way to get by in a life like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter dithers a little longer. &quot;...But I don't have to do it. I can just wash dishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Weasel sips again, watching Peter all the while. &quot;if that's what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He sees the moment that the kid makes the decision, right before he opens his mouth to give his answer. Peter looks at him, looking resolved. Which is better than resigned, Weasel reckons.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would it work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;The sneak sneak?&quot; Weasel clarifies, mostly to break the tension.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter chuffs a small, amused sound. &quot;Yeah, that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd give you a letter and a location. It'll have an address and sometimes, a more exact location to leave the letter. It'll all be people that want the information you're giving them, so it's not like you're leaving behind ransom notes or taunting the police like that zodiac nonsense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what's it for?&quot; Peter dares to ask. &quot;I don't want people to get hurt because of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeesh. Some people just need a way to communicate that the cops can't trace. I facilitate, but computer messages are getting less and less secure these days. Good old-fashioned paper is where it's at, but I'm not exactly light on my feet, you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Peter admits. He's hiding his nervousness well, but Weasel picks up on it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're probably committing crimes, kid. That's why it pays so well. But I can tell you this, I don't deal with the  real  scum of the earth. People that hurt children, sex traffickers, those guys that kidnap people and keep them in basements, HYDRA torture hoes. I don't go there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Expressive eyes flood with relief. &quot;You don't?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I got a friend who'd come slit my throat if he found out I was helping losers like that,&quot; Weasel shrugs. &quot;Keeps me honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter's mouth twists wryly. &quot;Sounds honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus, those guys? More trouble than they're worth,&quot; Weasel adds dismissively. &quot;They think they own you, start asking for more and more, it never stops at just helping a  bit.  No one owns me, not the government, not the police, no one. That's the whole fucking point of this place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter pauses for another moment, then folds up the parole form and shoves it back in his pocket. Subtle, but dramatic in it's own little way. He offers a hand for Weasel to shake.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;On the sneak sneak?&quot; Weasel nods and plants his hand on Peter's firmly. &quot;Alright!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that really what we're calling it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll figure something out, but before that, you're going to need a name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you forget it already?&quot; Peter quirks an eyebrow and the corner of his mouth at the same time. &quot;I thought you said you don't forget anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hilarious. Not when it benefits me, I said, but I digress,&quot; Weasel sighs deeply. &quot;You're not going by Peter Parker here, like some kind of - you know what? I've made so many Harry Potter references at this point, I think you get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter inclines his head, musing. &quot;So I need an alias.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta have something to yell at you sometimes, and it can't be what's on your license - &quot; Even as tipsy as Weasel is getting, he notices the drastic change on Peter's face. A brief jolt of panic that fades to intense unease. Weasel hadn't thought this was going to be the difficult part of the conversation. &quot;Whoa, what was  that  face? Is Peter not even your real name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is my real name,&quot; Peter says, harsh and immediate.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel sets down his glass and leans against it, propped up on his elbows.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;For this to be legit enough for your parole officer, it can't be under the table. I  am  going to see your ID, so you might as well tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter is tense, but he nods curtly, reaching in his back pocket again to pull out his wallet this time.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. Look for yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel takes it, not sure what he's supposed to expect. At first he doesn't see what's wrong with it - at least it's not a fake. His first thought was that the kid was too young to work here, but he's twenty, so that's fine for a back of house position.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The picture is what draws his attention next. The longer hair, the softer jaw, it's not just that he looks younger it's - and the name is -<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel blinks once, hard.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Peter mutters.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A record scratches in Weasel's head as his brain catches up.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, they put you in a women's prison, huh?&quot; Weasel knows it probably isn't appropriate to say, and probably makes him a terrible person, but he's pretty relieved, if he's honest with himself. Having to imagine this kid in prison with dudes that would make Weasel shit his pants was a bit much to think about on the regular. &quot;That's shitty, but safer, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Voice still tight, Peter nods again. &quot;That's what my lawyer said too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weasel brandishes the ID, waving it a bit as he heads toward the kitchen. His heart is pounding a bit faster than it usually does when he's been drinking, but hell if he's going to let it show. He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing, but the least he can do is be chill. He's good at that.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to go scan this, but as soon as payroll is set up, I'll shred it. Let me know when you get that shit changed all official-like so we can redo the paperwork.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's not like he doesn't have a dead name of his own, even if it's not quite the same thing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He gags dramatically. &quot;Don't be so polite all of a sudden, kid, it's creepy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Creepy?&quot; He hears Peter's voice loosen up a bit. &quot;Me? Do you have a trench coat to complete the whole pervert-on-the-library-computer vibe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go, &quot;Weasel approves. He disappears for a minute to scan it, then comes&quot;You'll be in the back most of the time, doing dishes, or delivering messages, out of sight. I don't need people inquiring about the barely legal chinchilla in my employ, for a whole host of reasons. The only person who'll be back there with you is Helga, the cook. She's mute and a little slow, so. She shouldn't give you trouble. Have you decided on what we should call you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I'm terrible at that, always have been.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;When in doubt, go with an animal. Could be related to your job or appearance or skill, whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter grimaces. &quot;How about Pidgeon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's stay away from plays on messenger birds,&quot; Weasel snarks, &quot;Kind of gives it away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh,&quot; Peter lifts his arms helplessly. &quot;You keep comparing me to various rodents, so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mouse!&quot; He snaps his fingers and points at Peter again. &quot;Ha, Weasel and Mouse. I like the sound of it. Like an Adult Swim show or some shit. This is a hole in the wall, and this is where we live and eat and banter. It'll be awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter makes a show of looking around the dusty old bar, cringing and wrinkling his nose.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...To be clear, I don't want to  live  in this place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. So if you don't want to die here either,&quot; Weasel gulps down the rest of his drink and then slides the glass over to Peter, purposefully. &quot;Get to work. We open in three hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
some nights are worse than others<br />
<br />
<br />
(See the end of the chapter for notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
It's been a month since securing a job at Hellhouse. It's been two weeks since he was allowed to move out of the halfway house, after getting his first paycheck.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
It's been ten months since Spider-man patrolled the streets. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Peter is glad to be back with aunt May. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
She seems so happy to have him there, too, despite everything. Even if this tiny one-bedroom apartment isn't the home he'd grown up in. May had nearly lost the house when Uncle Ben died, and the court fees during and after his arrest dealt the final blow.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
He swallows and turns over, the thin mattress in the fold-out sofa squeaking loudly as he does so. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
It's good to be in the city again, good to not be misgendered every day, good to not have to worry about being under surveillance constantly for fear of letting his abilities slip, good not to have to defend himself <br />
<br />
just <br />
<br />
enough but not <br />

Hi to anyone who's read my sneak peeks from my 30 Days of Writing series. Here's the first full chapter!<br />
<br />
Hello to anyone new and reading this - I hope you stick around!<br />
<br />
Character tags should be completed. All additional tags will be added as the story progresses.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
<br />
<br />
(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I swear, that guy is not real,&quot; Stiles mumbles to his best friend, Scott, on the bench. It's lacrosse practice on Monday afternoon, and Derek Hale, senior and captain of the team, is trying to slowly explain his moves. He wants everyone to pay attention, because he's trying to improve their plays for the big game on Saturday. However, Derek's &quot;slow&quot; movement is still too fast for Stiles.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek moves faster than anyone he's ever seen before. It's not as though people don't talk about the fact that Derek has &quot;mad skills&quot; (Scott's words, not his), but Stiles is having a hard time believing that his &quot;mad skills&quot; aren't suspicious.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek stops talking to the team, eyeing the junior. Stiles' thoughts are interrupted because he'd gotten used to the way Derek's voice sounds, and the silence had surprised him. His expression is the same as always: not happy. Stiles doesn't shift uncomfortably, even though he is uncomfortable under Derek's stare. He just makes eye contact, and gives Derek his best loopy grin.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't need to cross his arms to let everyone know that is not impressed. It's alright though, because Stiles knows his position as bench warmer is secure. Derek asks, &quot;Is there something you would like to say to the team, Stilinski?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek knows his name? He's been on this team for two whole fucking months and not once did Derek refer to him by name. Actually, Stiles is sure this is the first interaction they've ever actually had, so he's not sure that Derek has ever referred to him by anything before. They'd been in the same space before, years ago, but Stiles knows they never spoke. Not once. Stiles would remember if they had. Derek's not the forgettable type by any means. He just shrugs and tells the captain, &quot;I was wondering if you're even human. You move so quickly. I mean, it's ridiculously fast. No human should be able to move that fast, y'know? It's unfair for us. I mean, it's obvious you work out, and I don't, so that could be why, but like...I was just wondering if you were human, that's all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watches, his curiousity doubling, as Derek quickly adverts his eyes. He then looks over at Boyd, the big scary lacrosse player who Stiles is terrified of. They share some sort of look that Stiles can't identify. There's a story there, he thinks. Derek says, &quot;Stop talking, Stilinski, or I'll--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Put me on the bench all season?&quot; Stiles asks knowing full well that Derek Hale can't threaten Stiles with shit. Even if he kicked Stiles off the team, he'd still hang around at practices. Someone had to keep Scott company while he goes on this &quot;whole new me&quot; kick. Although it had been two and a half months, and Stiles realizes that Scott is too determined to be somebody people remember. Not that Stiles is complaining. It's added something new to their lives, and Scott isn't changing drastically.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some snickers come from the rest of the team. Stiles notices one of their teammates, Isaac Lahey, rubbing his hands together nervously. Derek just sighs, frustrated, as if he can't handle Stiles anymore. Then he continues talking about his new play, while the first liners and Scott listen carefully. Stiles, of course, just watches Derek a little more closely than ever. There's something unusual about how fast he moves. When Derek pretends to dodge a blow from the other team, the movement makes his body seem a little blurry for a split second.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, Stiles doesn't think Derek's even human. But that might not just be because he can move. He's practically a god with his grumpy expressions, his sharp looks (the only interaction they'd had before today), and the way his ass looks in his lacrosse pants. Stiles saw Derek smile once, from across the courtyard, and he'd accidentally knocked over two garbage cans. That's how beautiful Derek Hale is. He'd never heard his laugh though, but damn, he could bet that it was a rich, flowing sound. Or maybe it sounds as if Derek had a bad cough because his body had no idea how to make the noise.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not as though Stiles had been stalking Derek, but he knows a lot about him over the years of...casually paying attention to him. Derek Hale hangs out with Boyd, the extremely terrifying dude on the team, Erica, a freakishly sassy blonde girl who was also freakishly hot, and Isaac, a quiet kid who never talked and always kept his head down.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then of course, the other Hales. His sisters, Cora and Laura, hang around Derek a lot. He always sees Derek's sisters laughing, and poking him, while Grumpy Pants looks ready to murder one of them. Or both.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's obvious, though, when Derek hugs them goodbye, or shoves them away with one hand, that he adores them. Stiles sees it in his face, even if his grumpy expression doesn't change much. Once, some guy had been harassing Cora, and Derek went all caveman on him. The guy had run away. Run. There hadn't been any chance of stopping him either. He'd been terrified. No one bothers the Hale sisters anymore.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stilinski, since you're clearly not paying attention--&quot; Derek starts to say.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh trust me, I'm paying attention.&quot; It comes out flirtier than he means. Still, Stiles beams up at him with mischief dancing in his eyes. He can't tell a soul how anyone else reacts, because his full attention is on Captain Hale. God, he's sexy. He quickly repeats the play to Derek, and smirks with satisfaction when Derek deflates a little. &quot;But I do have a suggestion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people on the team (read: Jackson, the asshole) roll their eyes, others look amused (Boyd, intense dude), and some people's eyes bounce back and forth between the two of them with a deep expression of worry (Isaac, the quiet kid).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Derek asks. He doesn't look mad or even annoyed. He almost looks hopeful? That's weird. Derek just oozes confidence, so why would he look hopeful that Stiles has a suggestion? Stiles wonders if Derek's bored of being captain and always coming up with plays for the team in Coach's office.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of Coach, where the hell is he today?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles squares his shoulders a little, as he tries to draw his thoughts back in. Maybe Derek is one of those twisted souls that enjoys feedback. Stiles hates hearing people tell him how crappy he's doing, or that he should improve something, because he feels like it's a person attack. Even if it totally isn't.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Instead of Boyd, use Scott. The other team will be expecting Boyd. They always put four guys on him.&quot; Stiles grins at Boyd, who only nods in agreement. Whew, he won't be getting punched today. &quot;And you know Scott can catch the ball and run fast. It's his throwing that needs work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks buddy, but I don't think--&quot; Scott starts to say.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek nods at Stiles. He clearly thinks the idea over in his head for a second, before announcing, &quot;Alright. Let's run through it. I know you've been running regularly, so I--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How do you know we run regularly?&quot; Stiles asks, not caring that he's just interrupted Derek. Most people on this team would have been slapped over the head by another teammate for even considering interrupting Derek, but no one would touch Stiles. Being the Sheriff's son has some perks, even if they're limited. At least, he thinks it's because of that. Then again, he wouldn't put it past Jackson to take a swing at him.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running for Scott and Stiles had become part of the New Improved Scott McCall plan. They ran every Tuesday and Thursday night. Sometimes Stiles runs alone on Saturdays and Sundays, or after practices. It'd become a way to blow off steam, a way to escape for Stiles.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I live by the forest.&quot; Derek leaves it at that. Stiles thinks, Well duh. Everyone knows where the Hale house is. Derek shouts names and gets people onto the field. He doesn't look at Stiles, leaving him on the bench, and walks over to the team.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reiterates exactly what he wants them to do, and blows a whistle. Stiles knows exactly where the Hale house is--and Scott isn't a fan of running by it often.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles, bored of the bench suddenly despite having enjoyed most of his time on it, gets up and walks to stand beside Derek. They silently watch the team go through the play. Scott catches the ball each time, and runs as fast as he can. Stiles and Scott had been working on his endurance without his inhaler, and surprisingly, it'd helped. But each time the play was over, Stiles would hand Scott his inhaler, and they'd do it again. Each time would be slightly different, per Derek's instructions.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watches each player, studying them. Scott's doing a great job, and Derek's been giving him a few more pointers on how to shoot. Boyd is intense as always, but he actually seems to be enjoying himself immensely. Stiles watches Jackson charge towards Isaac, who doesn't run out of the way--just prepares for impact. Jackson skids to a stop before he makes contact, and then scoops up the ball that Isaac had dropped.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, the team waits for direction from their captain. Isaac and Scott are standing near Stiles, so Stiles holds his hand out for a high-five from his buddy.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Again!&quot; Derek bellows.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles watches as Isaac flinches. It's a subtle movement.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They work through the play again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This might work, Stilinski,&quot; Derek mutters. Stiles wonders if that's his way of saying he's impressed. Stiles isn't sure though, because the statement had sounded like neither here nor there, just Derek murmuring thoughts aloud.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It will,&quot; Stiles says with certainty. &quot;Scott has a lady to impress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek turns to give him the most skeptical expression humanly possible. Stiles just snorts in response and says, &quot;We have ten minutes of practice left. They worked hard enough, send them to the showers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is my team,&quot; Derek mumbles. But he blows the whistle and waves them inside anyway.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Our team,&quot; Stiles corrects. &quot;Dude, there's no &quot;I&quot; in team.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek gives him a levelled look, and then asks, &quot;Why are you even on the team?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles wonders if he should be offended. He's not, and is tempted to act as though he is, but decides against it. He just gives Derek the truth.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because someone's gotta look out for Scott. He could embarrass himself, and what friend lets him do that alone?&quot; Stiles jokes, but the amusement falls flat on Derek. Stiles shrugs, and heads towards the school.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He debates whether he should call Lydia tonight. Scott will be too happy about playing in this weekend's game to listen to Stiles' ramblings about Derek Hale. And boy, does Stiles have ramblings about Derek freaking Hale.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he gets into the parking lot about twenty minutes later, Scott chattering away about the big game, Stiles spots Cora running past them. He follows her with his eyes, or tries to anyway because dammit, she's fast too. Must be a Hale thing. And Stiles finds she's throwing her arms around Derek. He watches as Derek picks her up off the ground, simply by squeezing her and standing up straight, and then drops her onto her feet. Cora punches his shoulder, but then they both laugh.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek Hale just laughed. Laughed. Derek Hale. He says something to Cora, which makes her laugh really hard. Her hands are flying as she speaks, and Derek high-fives her. He high-fives her. Stiles knows he's staring but he doesn't care.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it that he'd been thinking that he'd never heard Derek laugh today and Derek laughs? Of course, Stiles is too far away to hear it and that pisses him off. But he can see for himself that Derek's laugh didn't sound like a dry cough. Plus Cora doesn't seem surprise, so he must laugh more often than Stiles thought.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles wonders what he has to do to hear that noise. Suddenly, he decides that it's his new life mission. Make Derek Hale laugh that freely. Yeah, it's not a bad plan at all.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dude, are you even listening to me?&quot; Scott whines. He taps on the Jeep to get Stiles' attention.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did you just see that? Derek laughed. And smiled. And I think he made a joke.&quot; Stiles opens up his driver's door and leans over to unlock Scott's door. Stiles isn't sure why he locks the doors to his Jeep. The truth is that his dad, the Sheriff, had drilled a personal book called, How to Be Safe, into his head. Nothing interesting ever happens in Beacon Hills, so Stiles isn't sure why he feels compelled to listen.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who cares what Derek does?&quot; Scott asks. Then he looks suddenly worried. &quot;Think Allison will come to the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lydia will make her go to watch Jackson, so probably.&quot; Stiles' mind is still on Derek as he pulls out of the parking lot. It bewildered Stiles that Derek could look happy, let alone be happy. Stiles supposes he just never thought about it. It's not as if he thinks of Derek often anyway.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truly, he doesn't. Except maybe today, because Stiles is an awful bro and doesn't catch a word that Scott says until they pull up into Scott's driveway. &quot;I can't wait. Maybe we can work on your skills this week and get you up to first line quality. I hate to leave you on the bench.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles snorts. &quot;Dude, the bench and I are homies now. Don't worry about me. I like the illusion of being on the team. You should ask Isaac to help practice your skills. He's pretty good, and he won't yell at you like the rest of the team probably would.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He doesn't even talk,&quot; Scott says. &quot;It could be weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No weirder than you making first line for a play. It's worth a shot. You should call Allison and ask her to come, even though she'll probably be coming anyway.&quot; Stiles gives his best friend his best smile, and Scott beams. &quot;She'll probably be happy to hear from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's a great idea! Thanks so much, buddy. I'll drive myself to school tomorrow. I won't have that big project to bring in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sounds good. See you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;See ya!&quot; Scott jumps out of the Jeep, and shuts the door, leaving Stiles to think.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Stiles gets home, he realizes that his obsession with Derek Hale is back. Was it ever really gone though? He's positive that he knows nothing about Derek Hale, even though he believes that Derek loves swimming, hates soccer (Derek had ranted about how pointless it was once, which made Stiles laugh because dude, lacrosse isn't any different really), and can go either way on a warm piece of pie. He knows nothing else though, because Derek laughed today, and Stiles hasn't seen that once since he developed his fascination with him seven years ago. What ten year old wouldn't?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek is only a year older, but even at eleven; he'd given off this air of confidence, mixed in with mystery, and a vibe that had made Stiles wonder why he seemed so responsible. Derek had been a very serious child. Stiles had wanted to be like him. To be all tough and surly at eleven. By the time his eleventh birthday had come around, Stiles had forgotten his small fascination with Derek Hale.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he was thirteen that is, and he had joined the swim team (his dad was encouraging sports, especially after his mom had died). Derek Hale had been on the team too, swimming faster than anyone. Sometimes Stiles had watched him with an innocent curiousity that had grown into a full-blown obsession. Derek Hale looked good, even at fourteen, half-naked. Stiles could appreciate it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in his life, Stiles had already developed an appreciation for both sexes. Not that he had told Scott until they were sixteen. Scott, of course, had immediately suggested he ask Danny on a date. Stiles had shrugged off the idea, if only because Danny is so far out of his league and interested in a guy named Ethan. Just because Danny is out and proud, doesn't mean that he and Stiles would hit it off. He and Danny had kind of become friends anyway. Kind of. He's not entirely sure Danny likes him much, because Danny's best friend is Jackson, and Jackson hates Stiles.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles feels creepy, wondering what's beyond the surface of Derek Hale. He's officially seen proof that Derek can laugh and high-five, and now Stiles wants to know everything about him. Last year, Derek had almost lost his family in a fire. Stiles had heard all the details from his dad, who had only told him so that Stiles would quit bitching at how rude Derek Hale is.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison Argent's older sister, Kate, had been dating Derek for a few months. Apparently, she had gone crazy. She had claimed that the Hales were monsters who needed to be &quot;put down&quot; and had tried to set their house on fire. Luckily, Derek's mother, Talia, had caught her in time to call the cops.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate admitted to everything and had been moved to a mental institute for help. She just kept muttering about how the Hales are monsters. The Sheriff said at one point she's screamed it. Stiles' dad explained that Derek could have lost everything, and that was tough for a kid to go through, so Stiles needed to be nice.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that Stiles had ever truly been mean to Derek. That would've required them to talk.  Hell, Stiles knows that they hadn't even talked when they'd been on the swim team together. For two main reasons: one, Derek had been in a completely different level, and two, Stiles had stayed off Derek's radar until today. Or, he supposes, maybe until he signed up for the team with Scott. As captain of the lacrosse team, Stiles figures Derek must have taken time to learn everyone's names.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems like the responsible thing to do. Stiles snorts at the thought. Jesus, Hale.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dad!&quot; Stiles shouts when he realizes that he wants to know if he has information on the Hales. When he doesn't hear a response, he decides to head downstairs. It's only then that he remembers his dad's on the night shift.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling restless, Stiles decides to go for a run. He won't invite Scott though. Today's Monday, and Scott only ran on days they didn't have practice. Stiles ran because it's one place where he can turn his brain off.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He parks his Jeep at the side of the road, and makes sure it's locked tight. Not that there's anything worth stealing in his baby, but he knows his dad would lecture him if he found out. He turns on his music, putting his headphones in. Stiles starts off with a slow jog, before he finds a faster pace that suits him.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All thoughts of Derek, the ones that had been plaguing him since practice today, slip away. It isn't until Stiles turns down a path that's close to the Hale house that he lets his thoughts go down that path.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't slow down, but he turns down his music, listening to see if any of the Hales are outside. And scores.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh my god, Derek, you're so unfair!&quot; Cora's familiar voice comes. Stiles starts to slow down now. &quot;Why did you have to tell Mom that I have a crush?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know the rules,&quot; Derek. There's a sound of car doors shutting.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;God, you ruined a great day!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles strains to hear anything else, so he slows down into a walk. He's a little out of breath, so it's a perfect time to take a small break.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another door, heavier like a house door, slams shut. Stiles tries to glance through the bushes, and in his distraction, doesn't see Derek Hale on the path. So naturally, he crashes into him and stumbles down to the ground.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Stiles looks up, all he sees is a grumpy ass Derek Hale glaring at him. &quot;Whoa, dude, should've said something. I didn't see you--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stilinski,&quot; Derek growls. Goddammit, that sounds so nice coming from Derek's lips. Stiles really needs to get over his obsession with the dark, brooding, and don't forget mysterious, Derek Hale. How is that going to happen when he speaks like that? He's suddenly acknowledging Stiles' existence, and Stiles isn't going to pass that up for anything. &quot;What are you doing here? You and Scott run on Tuesdays and Thursdays.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And I run on the days we don't, alone.&quot; Stiles shakes his head. &quot;Seriously dude. Do you have no manners? Help me up, would you? You knocked me over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek doesn't move, or look very impressed, so Stiles sighs dramatically and scrambles to stand up. He brushes off his ass.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's not safe to run alone past dark, Stilinski.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles can't resist. He sticks his tongue out at Derek. &quot;The sun won't set for another forty minutes. I'll make it back to my car by then, Hale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek eyes him carefully, as if he doesn't buy Stiles' lie. Truth is that Stiles doesn't give a shit if he's running in the dark. What's the big deal? It's not like there's anything that's going to come out and attack him. Literally nothing happens in Beacon Hills. It's not a bad thought, because it keeps his dad safe. &quot;Good. Be sure to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you're worried, about poor, little ol' me, you could always join me. Protect me from the dangers of the woods.&quot; Stiles waits to see Derek's reaction. Not one damn thing changes on his face. He doesn't even look the slightest bit amused, and Stiles remembers his goal to make Derek laugh. He gives him his best smile.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just go home, Stiles.&quot; Derek's expression changes slightly, as if he's suddenly tired.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;God, no one wants me fucking anywhere these days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sure that you have more private places to fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles blinks three to maybe a thousand times before he realizes just what exactly Derek Hale had said to him. He snorts, and that turns into a full laugh. Clapping a hand on Derek's shoulder, and bending forward, he wheezes, &quot;Holy shit that was priceless. Your face. I bet you do excellent at poker.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Never played,&quot; Derek mumbles. But Stiles sees it. He sees that Derek's a little more relaxed, a little more amused.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We should sometime,&quot; Stiles suggests. Then he hastily adds, &quot;A lacrosse team bonding experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek cocks his head, intrigued. &quot;Do you think the team needs to bond more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Duh. At least, bond without Jackson. He's an asshole, and no one likes him but Lydia.&quot; Stiles shrugs, taking his hand off Derek's shoulder. How had he managed to keep it there for longer than a second? &quot;But it might be nice. Make us more team-feeling. Well, the others anyway. Greenberg and I are content to stay on the bench.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek turns his head suddenly and then looks at Stiles with his grumpy face again. &quot;Go home, Stiles. Don't keep running tonight, alright? You'll wear yourself out for practice tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just like that, Derek jogs away from him, through the bushes towards his house. Stiles doesn't entirely know why he listens--maybe because it's Derek freaking Hale and everyone listens to Derek--but he heads back to his car. Now, Stiles wonders how it's possible to have gone seven years without ever saying one word to Derek, to having three separate conversations in one day.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. He could almost get used to this.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek Hale is a sex god, and Stiles wants to find out just how good he is.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he pulls up into his driveway, he finds himself smiling. I'm sure you have more private places to fuck. What a joke. Stiles wouldn't have expected Derek to have in it, but as he realized earlier, he doesn't really know Derek too well.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is Allison out there yet?&quot; Scott whispers nervously to Stiles, who puts his hand on his shoulder sympathetically. Scott hadn't shut up all week about the game. It's okay though, because Stiles had called Lydia three times this week to gush about how fine Derek Hale's ass is. Stiles hadn't talked to Derek since Monday, but he'd gone to practices and watched Derek's ass when he could. Stiles gets how Scott feels. A little, anyway. Stiles likes to think he has more self-control than Scott.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He totally doesn't.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles peeks around the corner, his eyes immediately finding the little ginger he'd had such a big crush on. After Lydia Martin, with her determined look, had told him that he would never, ever have a chance with her, she had said that they could be friends. Stiles is pretty grateful for Lydia's friendship. The girl just knows how to give advice, and cut out all irrationality. She sits on the bleachers, with a brunette at her side. Stiles whips back around the corner to look at Scott. &quot;She's here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh god,&quot; Scott whines. &quot;I need her to think I'm...&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scott, if she doesn't like you for who you are, she's stupid.&quot; Stiles shakes his head. He steers Scott back to the change rooms, giving him a pep talk the entire time. &quot;You told me that your phone call went well, and she's been sitting with us during lunch, so stop worrying. She's clearly into you, and I'm sorry, but your lacrosse skills aren't going to make or break it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You think?&quot; Scott asks, hope filling his tone.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, that's the Scott that Stiles knows and love. Scott is the definition of hope. Stiles had been in some rough spots, especially after his mother had passed away, but Scott always brought his mood back up. Scott is hope personified. So, if Scott has hope that he can impress Allison, Stiles is positive his buddy will impress Allison.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know so,&quot; Stiles says, loyally. He gives Scott a beaming smile, before they enter the locker room again. Derek eyes them when they walk in, as though he doesn't trust whatever they had just been up to, and Stiles adds quietly to Scott, &quot;You're going to do great, Scott. And even if you fail, you'll bounce back. You always do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're the best, Stiles.&quot; Scott leans into his best friend a little. Stiles glances around, super casually, before he lets his gaze land on Derek. Derek adverts his eyes, but Stiles knows that he was looking at them. He almost feels as though Derek's listening to them, but it's impossible. There's so much noise going on right now, and Derek's on the other side of the room. &quot;I'm glad you joined the team with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Anything for you, man. I'm excited to watch you play!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's only happening because you suggested it to Derek. Have I thanked you for that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Only thirteen thousand times, Scott. Shut up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coach gets everyone's attention with a quick yell. Stiles notices Isaac jump. Coach points a finger at Scott. &quot;McCall, I hear that our big game move depends on you. Christ almighty, don't fuck it up or you'll be joining Bilinski on the bench permanently for next year too. God forbid you become another Greenberg. I already have one of those, and--oh, Greenberg, shut up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles ignores the rest of Coach's pep talk, which is from Independence Day, and nothing he hasn't heard before. It isn't long before Coach is shouting at them to get their asses onto the field.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles runs out beside Scott and Isaac. Scott hadn't taken his suggestion to ask for Isaac's help on improving, so Stiles plans to ask after the game is over. It's not as though Scott will get better with his help, so why not ask Isaac? The kid might not talk much, and maybe Stiles had observed that those reasons are most likely due to the fact that he looks like a scared puppy all the time. Stiles had seen Isaac tug his clothing on once. He'd just gotten a glance, because the movement has caught his eyes. He had still seen the bruises. They aren't bruises from lacrosse, and the thought makes Stiles a little sick to his stomach.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd talked to his dad about it, but without any evidence of it, or Isaac asking for help, there isn't much they can do.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But maybe if Isaac hung around Scott after school to work on his lacrosse skills, Isaac would have an extra few hours break of being terrified. Not that Stiles could assume that Isaac is terrified. Hell, he can't assume much, except that it's obvious Isaac is miserable. He wonders how hanging out around Derek Hale sometimes helps, because Derek's just as miserable.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles settles down on the bench. Truth be told, Derek isn't just as miserable. Not after seeing the way he'd laughed the other day.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wondering if Derek, who's now on the field and kicking some ass, had thought about Stiles much after their encounters on Monday, Stiles kicks a rock with his shoe. He probably hadn't given Stiles a second thought, but Stiles hadn't stopped thinking about Derek since Monday. He had many unanswered questions. He had been trying hard to not romanticize Derek, but he's not entirely sure he's succeeded.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He keeps his eyes bouncing between Derek and Scott. At one point, Derek gets the ball and starts to run. He's going seriously fast until he visibly slows down. Stiles watches, his eyes narrowing on Derek. Stiles is positive, absolutely positive, that Derek realized he was running too fast and slowed down to a more normal speed. Stiles cocks his head, wondering what the hell that was about.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What--did anyone just--?&quot; Stiles turns to see the only person around him is Greenberg. Greenberg wouldn't have seen shit. He leans forward, focusing on Derek now. Because that isn't normal, and how isn't anyone else reacting?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not the first time it happens either. Stiles catches Derek running too fast, and slowly down with a quick glance around while wearing a guilty expression, three more times. Stiles turns to look for the Hales in the seats. When he spots them, he watches as Cora murmurs something out of the corner of her mouth to her mother, who looks highly displeased even though her son's scored most of the goals tonight.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles can't figure it out, except he knows that Derek had had to think about slowing his run down. No one else would have picked up on it, because they're not studying Derek as though he's the key answers to every single exam Stiles would ever have to take.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wondering why the Hales are ridiculously fast people--he'd seen Cora running the other day, and it's not as though his brain had filed that away--or why Derek's mother looked disapproving of Derek's awesome skills, Stiles considers the fact that maybe Mr. Serious takes steroids. Perhaps Derek's mother knows that, and is disappointed in her son. Coach doesn't do frequent drug tests. Stiles thinks that's mainly because Coach forgets and assumes that he'll be able to tell if his students are on drugs.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it's entirely possible that Derek Hale is on steroids. The thought kind of disappoints Stiles, and he wonders if that's because he'd romanticized him. He really doesn't want to do that.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not when Derek starts cheering for Scott to run. Wait, where did the time go? This is their last play. Stiles looks up at the scoreboard. It's counting down from 13 seconds, and Stiles stands up. He starts cheering for Scott, forgetting to feel bad about not realizing that the game is almost over, and pumps a fist in the air.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, buddy!&quot; he shouts, laughing. He grins with pride as Scott shoots and...scores!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles goes crazy, and runs out onto the field to be the first one to tackle Scott.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiles knocks Scott down in one sweet tackle.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You did it!&quot; Stiles shouts into Scott's face, laughing. &quot;You did it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know! How cool was that?! And it's all 'cause of you!&quot; Scott throws his arms around Stiles, neither of them </td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">The battle had started out as a perfectly standard superpowered frenzie of gods versus science and man versus monster, save of course for the location. This week the Justice League was tearing through the streets of Gotham, and while Batman was none too happy about it, short of enclosing the city in an electromagnetic shield there wasn't much he could do about it. Lex Luther had taken the fight to the Dark Knight's territory, thereby lending Superman de facto jurisdiction over the area, and the Man of Steel had decided it was a League matter. So here they were on Gotham's rooftops, robots raining down and Bat E.M. Shield patent pending. Still, besides the change in scenery it was shaping up to be a relatively standard fight.<br />
<br />
But nothing lasts forever.<br />
<br />
Sparks and metal were flying as the team tore through bots right and left, when suddenly a crackle sounded through the air and some form of lightning shot across the sky directly towards the Dark Knight. The League all turned to where the Batman had been standing and froze. There was a moment of perfect silence before Green Lantern asked,<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a-?&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn't need to finish the thought before all of his team mates nodded. There was absolutely no denying it. In place of Batman sat a very big, very fluffy black cat.<br />
<br />
The battle still raging around them and a fat kitty cat far from the most useful soldier, the Flash scooped up the cat and ran as the team turned their attention once again to the matter at hand. Not wanting to lose track of the cat -Batman? Batman's replacement? Batman as a cat? Catman? He wasn't sure at this point, thoughts racing as always- Flash put him in a box in the alley. Then, thinking better of it, he flipped the empty box over on top of the cat and placed a garbage bag on top. Not heavy enough to crush the box but hopefully heavy enough to keep the cat inside from flipping it over and escaping. Idly he thought to himself that if this cat really was Batman he could definitely find a way to escape, but in any case this was the best he could do in the moment. Running back to the League, he took his place and started taking down bots, hardly a second lost.<br />
<br />
The team defeated Luthor relatively quickly and, now on the lookout to avoid crackling magic lightning, without further incidents. Thankfully this meant they could now focus on helping their poor furry colleague. Unfortunately, they had no idea how to do that. The obvious course of action was to ask Zatanna, but as this was a Luthor fight with robots and she had a full plate of curses and spells to undo in her own time she hadn't been one of the members pulled for this mission. Also, present or not she would need time to look into what exactly had happened and what would be the safest way to reverse it. They sent a message to her JLA communicator, but they knew that one way or another they were going to be stuck with a big fluffy Batcat for at least a little while. Deciding to go assess the situation, the team followed Flash to where he had left the cat. Cautiously lifting the box, he and the rest of the League looked under it to see exactly what they were dealing with.<br />
<br />
The cat was huge, both in terms of substance and fluff. It had blue eyes and black fur with a swatch of grey across its chest, very reminiscent of the Bat's chest insignia. And it was mad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Flash said, &quot;that's gotta be him right? Like look at him, he's even got a bat on his chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure,&quot; Black Canary countered, &quot;maybe he was just switched out with a cat. I mean teleportation seems a lot more within Luthor's wheelhouse than transmutation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Green Lantern shook his head, &quot;that's definitely him. Look how angry it is. I've only ever seen that glare come off of one creature and that's Bats.&quot; Just then the cat hissed. &quot;See!&quot; Green Lantern shouted. &quot;That's a Bat Glare if I ever saw one.&quot; Superman nodded thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why dont we just ask him?&quot; He knelt down and put his hand out. &quot;Here kitty kitty, do you know who we are? Is that you? Can you talk to us?&quot; The cat sniffed cautiously at his hand before rearing up and swiping at it. The Man of Steel pulled back. &quot;Guess not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be so sure,&quot; Wonder Woman interjected. &quot;In much magic and myth, subjects of transformation into animals retain personality but not cognizance. Thus it is possible that this cat is Batman but he has not the thought process to communicate it in any way, or indeed even remember it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why does he still look ticked off at me?&quot; Green Lantern asked. Wonder Woman chuckled at her friend's petulance.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I am right he has the same personality and disposition as he always does. He may well remember many important things on instinct, if not details.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like not liking you,&quot; Green Arrow smirked. Green Lantern stuck out his tongue at the archer who simply laughed. The team sat for a few minutes trying to formulate a plan. None of them could get very close to their transformed team mate without him hissing. Wonder Woman could get the closest but even she could not have touched him, and none of them knew what they would do next even if they could. Just as they were beginning to think the situation was hopeless, the cat took off running out of the alley. Flash darted after him and brought him back, getting a few scratches as he set him down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't do that Batcat!&quot; He scolded, &quot;We can't have you getting lost, we'll never fix you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, why would he get lost?&quot; Superman mused, clearly coming up on the edges of a plan. &quot;Diana, you said that he might remember important things like they were instincts, right?&quot; Wonder Woman nodded. &quot;Alright so, why don't we let him go? This is Gotham. He knows this place better than anyone, surely he'll go somewhere he knows, and knowing Batman it will be fully stocked with anything anyone could ever possibly need, including maybe something that would help us with this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Green Arrow hummed, &quot;that seems pretty risky. What if he crawls in a drain grate or something and we can't get him? I mean for crying out loud, what if he climbs a tree? What are we gonna do, call the Gotham fire department? Say 'hey, sorry to bother you but we've got the Dark Knight up an oak and we don't have any tuna on hand to lure him down? Can you help us out?'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have a whole lot of other options, GA,&quot; Green Lantern commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am afraid Green Lantern is right,&quot; Wonder Woman agreed. &quot;Even as a cat, Batman knows this city better than any of us, and probably better than anyone else in Gotham. We've no choice but to follow him.&quot; Nodding, the team stepped out of his way, and Batcat took off down the street. At one point or another during their chase through town each of the Leaguers had the off-handed thought that they must make quite an interesting scene: half a dozen costumed superheroes chasing a fluffy fat cat down streets, through parking garages, up and down hills, and even at one point right into a bodega. Finally though, Batcat led them out of downtown and started heading up into a somewhat forested area. Coming through the trees the League saw a huge expanse of land, lush and green and impeccably well manicured. In the middle of this great expanse sat a mansion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Green Arrow said, stopping short. The team looked back only to see that Black Canary had done the same. &quot;Why is Batman leading us to Wayne Manor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where?&quot; Flash asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wayne Manor,&quot; Black Canary echoed. &quot;That's Bruce Wayne's mansion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's right,&quot; Superman confirmed. The team stood and watched as the cat continued unphased towards the huge house.<br />
<br />
&quot;What business would Batcat believe he has here?&quot; Wonder Woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why do you all know Bruce Wayne's house on sight?&quot; Green Lantern asked. None of the three had a good answer that would not compromise their civilian identities, so they simply looked to each other before Superman shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can muse over that later. Right now we have to follow that cat.&quot; Agreeing, the League dropped the issue and trotted after the cat. He had reached the front door and was now simply meowing at it, begging to be let in. The League looked at each other for a moment, silently asking one another for a plan. Finding no answer, Flash shrugged took matters into his own hands, ringing the door bell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flash!&quot; Canary scolded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Flash defended, &quot;what else were we gonna do?&quot; A few moments later the door was opened by an older gentleman in a smart black suit and a stiff upper lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; he greeted them. &quot;May I help you?&quot; Everyone opened their mouths to try and explain but they were cut off by a happy meow and loud purring. &quot;Oh my,&quot; said the man at the door. The team looked down in shock at Batcat who had flopped down on the man's shoes and was lovingly rolling around as happy as could be. &quot;And who might this be?&quot; the man asked, slight amusement lacing the tone of his carefully neutral and very posh British accent. He bent down to pick up Batcat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't do that if-&quot; Superman started, but to his shock his warning fell on deaf ears as the man gently picked up the cat with no resistance. The team stared agape as he held the cat up to eye level, Batcat simply going along with his actions and purring all the while. A spark of recognition flitted across the man's face and the corner of his lip quirked up ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my,&quot; he said to the cat, &quot;this is quite a bit of trouble you've gotten yourself into, isn't it?&quot; Chuckling, he turned his attention back to the dumbfounded League on his doorstep. &quot;How did he get himself into this particular mess? Playing around with magical what-nots again?&quot; The League's shock only grew.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that's Batman?&quot; Flash blurted out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude!' Green Lantern smacked his friend's shoulder. &quot;What if he didn't know that yet? What if he just thought it was his cat that runs away a lot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he said magic what-nots!&quot; Flash countered. &quot;That's gotta mean he-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gentlemen, gentlemen,&quot; the older man interrupted, &quot;calm down. Your respect for his privacy is admirable, and no doubt appreciated by him, but I would know these eyes anywhere.&quot; Smiling, the man cradled the cat close to himself and scratched behind his ears. &quot;Thank you for bringing him home. How did you know to come here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We let him lead the way, sir,&quot; Superman answered. &quot;And to answer your previous question we aren't sure what happened to him. We were in battle and he got hit with something. We've called an expert to see what can be done about it.&quot; The man nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zatanna I have no doubt. Good, I am sure she will be able to sort this all out.&quot; He looked up and smiled. &quot;In the meantime why don't you all come in and sit down. I'll fix you all a cup of tea.&quot; Unsure of what to do and feeling as though turning down the offer was not really an option, the Justice League of America awkwardly shuffled through the door of Wayne Manor after the gentleman holding their feline coworker. Turning back to the team the man smiled again. &quot;My name is Alfred. No need to introduce yourselves to me, I am already familiar with you all, and I am happy you have finally found your way here. It's about time he brought you all, if I do say so myself, even if I highly doubt he meant to this time.&quot; Alfred chuckled and looked at the cat in his arms. &quot;It serves you right for being so stubborn.&quot; Turning towards the stair Alfred suddenly called out, &quot;Children, come down here. I have something you will want to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Children?&quot; Green Lantern asked before the resounding sound of a stampede boomed through the spacious foyer. Suddenly there were children coming from every direction; running down the stairs, swinging down off of balconies, emerging from side rooms and hidden doors, all of them gasping as they saw the Justice League standing in their front room. The gaggle of children (many of whom the League noticed could barely be called that) rushed up to them with excitement on their faces and started jabbering away with introductions and questions and what might have been a threat from the smallest one. They all instantly silenced however as Alfred cleared his throat, truly impressing the bewildered heroes. &quot;As much as I know you have wanted to meet the Justice League for a while, believe it or not they are not in fact what I was referring to.&quot; He held out the cat for the children to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got us another cat?&quot; the youngest asked excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Master Damian, I'm afraid not. The League brought this one to us. It seems that the Batman has fallen on some rather unfortunate circumstances.&quot; His smirk was well contained.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; the oldest gasped, grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can't be, can it?&quot; A blonde girl breathed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you telling us the old man got himself turned into a cat?&quot; asked a young man with a shock of white running through the front of his black hair. Calmly, a young woman with short black hair reached out to take the cat from Alfred. He handed him over gently and the girl stared into the cat's eyes. She looked back to the group and silently nodded, sending the entire group of kids into hysterics. Batcat just nuzzled the girl while the kids laughed uncontrollably. Then they all started passing him around to see and pet him, and the Dark Knight just purred louder than the engine on the Batmobile. The League stood and watched as these children gleefully traded one of the most feared men in the world back and forth, poking his belly and petting his tail and shouting out things like &quot;he's so cute!&quot; and &quot;look he's even got a grey little bat on his chest!&quot; and &quot;we absolutely must call Selina,&quot; all while the fearsome hero simply let it happen. If anything it seemed like he was trying to climb into the cuddles more, clutching their shoulders and headbutting them in the arms. Finally, the situation became too overwhelming for the team.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Flash started, always the first to speak up, &quot;what's going on? Who are you people? How do you know Batman? And more importantly how are you getting him to act so lovey dovey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man,&quot; Green Arrow agreed, &quot;it's freaking me out. He's never like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if it's any consolation,&quot; the oldest boy chuckled, &quot;he's very rarely like this in human form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but he hated us even in cat form!&quot; Green Lantern protested. The boy with a streak in his hair barked out a laugh, followed by the rest of the kids giggling as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's probably just working off instinct at this point,&quot; a boy of about seventeen said. He had somewhat long black hair and an extremely amused look on his face, not bothering to look up from where he was petting Batcat.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was my theory as well,&quot; Wonder Woman smiled. &quot;Very keen observation young man.&quot; The boy glanced up and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. So if we're right it stands to reason that he would be hostile to everyone but family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Family?&quot; Green Arrow shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no,&quot; Black Canary continued, &quot;because if you're his family, then that would mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Superman breathed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, baby,&quot; grinned the boy with the white streak.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can't be,&quot; Green Arrow shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can't,&quot; Superman started again, &quot;because you aren't, and you...&quot; suddenly he turned to the white streaked boy who was standing almost expectantly, grin still wide on his face. &quot;You're dead!&quot; The boy cackled.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's old news buddy,&quot; he winked, 'try and keep up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, don't be mean Jay,&quot; a girl with blue and purple hair teased. &quot;They can't all be the Fastest Man Alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no, don't look at me,&quot; Flash said, throwing his hands up in front of him, &quot;I have absolutely no idea what's going on here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Green Lantern backed him up, &quot;Will someone please catch those of us who didn't receive some sort of weird psychic message like the rest of you up to speed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; the oldest boy began, stepping forward with a warm lazy smile and a sunny disposition, &quot;I'm Dick Grayson. That's Alfred, Tim, Steph, Barbara, Cass, Damian, Duke, Harper, Cullen, and Jason Todd. Yes, that Jason Todd.&quot; He looked back to the others and then to the League. &quot;We're the Waynes,&quot; he said with a grin. &quot;And that,&quot; he pointed to the cat now curled up in Barbara's lap with his head against the arm of her wheelchair, &quot;is Bruce Wayne. Aka the Batman.&quot; The entire League erupted into chaos.<br />
<br />
&quot;Batman is Bruce Wayne?&quot; Superman shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Batman is a billionaire?&quot; came Green Lantern's shocked question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Batman is your DAD?&quot; Flash screamed. Wonder Woman seemed elated at this revelation that their seemingly lone wolf colleague had a large and bustling family, while Green Arrow and Black Canary seemed to have completely shut down in shock. The Wayne children for their part could not stop laughing, absolutely delighted with the entire situation. The chaos was becoming unmanageable when Alfred once again cleared his throat and, to the League's surprise, they found themselves instantly quieting. The older man nodded smugly and said,<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, that is enough of that. If you will all kindly follow me to the cave we can begin finding a solution to this mishap.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Batcave was as immense and confounding as the heroes had imagined it. Everywhere they looked they saw gadgets and suits and oddities. A life sized t-rex and a giant penny came into view as well as a line of indescribable blasters and equipment and was that a moat? It was so much to take in, especially in contrast to how nonchalant the Waynes were all acting in its midst. They were lounging and laughing as they watched Batcat swat happily at a string they held up for him. Every so often they would find something new to toss to him to play with, completely enrapt by their feline father figure. The League sat in wonder as they watched these civilians sit in what was unquestionably one of the finest superhero headquarters ever made. They should have looked completely out of place but somehow it seemed they were right where they belonged. They were comfortable and happy. They were entirely at home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Black Canary said, standing by a case the others had not seen yet. She had stood up to explore a bit but now she turned back to the Waynes eyes wide. &quot;Are you ALL vigilantes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked the entire League in unison. The children merely started laughing again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Cullen giggled, &quot;not ALL of us. I prefer to keep my feet firmly on the ground thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the rest of you?&quot; Superman asked incredulously. Each member of the family nodded. Suddenly Wonder Woman smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you must be Agent A?&quot; she asked Alfred.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say, Madame Diana, you've stumbled upon my little secret.&quot; Diana laughed warmly with the children as the rest of the League looked on.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Flash hummed, &quot;now that we know Batsy's biggest secret, it seems kind of silly for the rest of us to keep our identities secret. I mean, he was the one most concerned about it, and Diana told us on day one; it seems unfair to keep secrets anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Flash is right,&quot; Green Lantern remarked. &quot;If anyone feels they absolutely need to keep their identity secret no one is going to make you give it up, but I think since everybody else is already sharing here today,&quot; he gestured to the large group of Bat-themed vigilantes behind him, &quot;everyone who can might as well share too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll go first since I'm the one who brought it up. My name is Barry Allen. I'm a forensic scientist and I love ice cream,&quot; the Flash smiled. Everyone couldn't help but laugh. Shaking his head fondly, Green Lantern went next.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Hal Jordan. I'm a test pilot when I'm not off planet with the Lantern Corps and I really don't like sushi.&quot; This prompted quite a few shouts of agreement and disagreement from both assembled hero teams and more than a few laughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I'm next,&quot; said Superman with a quiet smile. &quot;My birth name is Kal-El but the name my adoptive parents gave me is Clark Kent. I'm a reporter for the Daily Planet and I grew up in Kansas. That's why I recognized the Manor and the kids, I've been here before to report on galas and I've interviewed most of you at least once,&quot; he added, turning to the kids. Gasps rang out through the Waynes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're Clark Kent?&quot; Harper shouted. &quot;I've known you for years! This is insane!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you're the guy who always lets me tell you about my opinions on soap operas instead of making me answer real questions?&quot; Stephanie asked. &quot;Dude you're like the best!&quot; Clark chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you have some pretty good insights.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got Alfred to come down off the rain gutter,&quot; Damian spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alfred the cat,&quot; Clark clarified for the very confused League. &quot;And yes,&quot; he said, turning back to Damian, &quot;I might have walked out of view and called the cat over to fly up and grab him where you couldn't see,&quot; he blushed. Damian considered this a moment and nodded approvingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You never asked me about his death,&quot; Dick said quietly with his eyes cast down. All other chatter fell away. Clark looked at him understandingly. &quot;When Jason died,&quot; Dick started again, clearing the emotion from his throat, &quot;you were the only reporter who didn't ask me how I was taking it. How much I missed him. What I was going to do next. The only one who didn't pry or try and patronize me. You were the only one who respected my grief.&quot; He looked up at Clark, eyes just this side of glassy, and Clark doubted he noticed himself move almost imperceptibly closer to his younger brother. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Clark whispered. He looked to Jason. &quot;I'm just happy to learn that you're back.&quot; Jason tried to smirk it off, but Clark could see he was feeling more than he let on. He imagined that being secretly alive was a hardship. He remembered that energetic, kind, whip-smart young boy Bruce Wayne had adopted as his second son, and he remembered the heartbreak he felt when he learned of his death. Jason seemed different now, Clark imagined a trauma like death would do that to you, but the reporter was still overjoyed to see him sitting in the same room again. Intellectually he understood why his return had been kept secret, that was a pretty hard issue to explain, but from the look on his face he wished Jason had gotten to hear that people were glad he was back more often. Clearing his throat and the air around them, Clark turned to Green Arrow and Black Canary. &quot;Well, are we going to get to find out who everyone's favorite super couple is?&quot; The two looked at each other and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Dinah Lance. I'm a singer and I'm married to this idiot,&quot; she said elbowing Green Arrow in the ribs playfully, &quot;and I'm afraid that may have given his identity away to at least one of you.&quot; She smiled as she saw Clark's face go slack. &quot;And I also like ice cream like Barry.&quot; Flash punched the air excitedly before high fiving Dinah. Green Arrow chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I'm Oliver Queen. That's why we recognized the house and the kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew it!&quot; shouted Cullen, startling the Leaguers.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did not,&quot; Tim scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did too! I figured it out on the Justice League fan message boards! I totally knew it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I didn't know it there's no way you figured it out,&quot; Tim crossed his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know Tim,&quot; Stephanie hummed, &quot;those message boards have some pretty detailed conspiracies on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh so you've been on them?&quot; he shot back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait really?&quot; Cullen shouted, &quot;What's your username?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, guys,&quot; Duke laughed, &quot;chill. Calm down, it doesn't matter who knew it and didn't know it. We all know now, yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Wonder Woman agreed. &quot;We all know now. We can confide in each other, and protect each other's identities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;RIght,&quot; Superman agreed. &quot;We've put our trust in each other, and it's going to make us stronger as a team.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can watch out for identity leaks too,&quot; Tim added. &quot;Like whoever on this message board managed to put the dots together about Green Arrow. Cullen? Can I trust you to help me craft some decoy conspiracies and red herrings? Steph you too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh,&quot; Cullen grinned, ringing his hands like a cartoon villain, &quot;I like where this is going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Stephanie laughed. The League couldn't help but laugh as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;And,&quot; Alfred spoke up from his place at the Batcomputer, quietly surveying the chaos as he waited for some tests to run. &quot;Any of you are always welcome here for medical attention, a safe haven, or simply a cup of tea.&quot; The League, quite touched, thanked him for the generous invitation. Dick laughed happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, B is going to hate this,&quot; he grinned. Alfred smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but he is simply going to have to find a way to deal with it. He must accept that he is not alone in his crusade for justice. He has family, and friends now as well, and he is going to find a way to live with that even if it kills him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It might,&quot; Jason snorted. The room erupted into laughter.<br />
<br />
Two days later Bruce was back to his normal human self. Alfred was right (as always), he didn't like that the League knew his identity and those of his children. He also didn't like that they were in the cave making plans for their next battle, and he absolutely hated that Green Lantern was currently sitting on his couch. But, again, Alfred was right (as always): he was learning to live with it.</td>

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
There's a palpable sense of unease on Harry's first day back at Hogwarts. He feels the absence of Ron and Hermione at his side like a phantom limb. As if that wasn't bad enough, Harry also feels the absence of all the students who didn't return. The ones who couldn't return.<br />
<br />
There are only six first years, shuffling in nervously, occasionally sneaking glances over at Harry and then quickly looking away, frightened and awed. Harry pays them no mind, instead watching the sorting ceremony with dull disinterest. The general mood is far more somber than it had been in the years before. With little fanfare, three first-years get sorted into Gryffindor, two to Ravenclaw, and the last to Slytherin: a pale, scared young girl whose head is almost entirely dwarfed by the Sorting Hat. The hall is pin-silent as she makes the journey to the Slytherin table, joining only four other students-- Parkinson, Zabini, Nott, and Malfoy. Harry tries not to look, but is inevitably swayed by the uncomfortable atmosphere. It's like a car crash-- horrifying, yet he can't look away.<br />
<br />
The new first year sits quietly at the Slytherin table, rounding out the number of students to five. None of the other students welcome her, and most barely spare her a glance. Harry is honestly surprised that there are any Slytherins at all-- most are either in hiding, or, in the more extreme cases, living out their sentences in Azkaban. All students were extended an invitation to come back to Hogwarts and finish their educations, of course, but no one had really expected any Slytherins to accept the offer. It was more of a perfunctory gesture on the part of the Ministry, but not meant with any real sincerity. Except, there they were, sitting in the Great Hall eating Pumpkin Pasties like nothing had changed. And, worst of all, Malfoy sat among them, head down, picking at his food like it had personally offended him.<br />
<br />
Once Harry's eyes catch on Malfoy, he's rooted to the spot.  Look away, dumbass,  he pleads internally. However, his eyes are not persuaded, and they continue to bore into the back of Malfoy's robes until he hesitantly looks over his shoulder to meet Harry's gaze. The second he does, they both hastily look away, and Harry feels his cheeks warm.  Idiot. <br />
<br />
And, okay, it's not that Harry  hates  Malfoy, or anything. Really, he doesn't. Sure, he may be an arrogant, pureblood tosser, but without him, there's a good chance that Harry wouldn't be alive. And, if anything, Malfoy probably went through almost as much as he did during the war. In a different way, for sure, but Harry's sure that he still has boatloads of unresolved trauma to deal with. Join the fucking club.<br />
<br />
So honestly, Harry doesn't hate Malfoy. Dislikes him, maybe, if anything. Possibly not even that, but the jury's still out on that count.<br />
<br />
Mostly, he's just...  uncomfortable. It feels strange, that after everything, Harry's back at Hogwarts with Malfoy, who was one of the only other unofficial &quot;eighth years&quot; to return. That after Harry stared death in the eye, he can return to school and stare at the back of Malfoy's head again, like he's back in first year. And really, strange as it is, Malfoy's one of the only familiar faces Harry has as company.<br />
<br />
Ron started Auror training only a few months ago, and Hermione travelled to America to attend the upper division at Ilvermorny. Ginny's back at Hogwarts, but Harry honestly hasn't spoken to her much since their breakup. It's not that they're on bad terms, per say, but Harry just wouldn't count her as a close friend at the moment. Neville's back at Hogwarts, too, but only for a teaching internship with Professor Sprout. Harry hasn't seen him at all since he's arrived, since he's reportedly spending his days in the greenhouse. Even Luna's out of the picture, gone to travel abroad with her father.<br />
<br />
So, really, it just boils down to Harry and Malfoy. It's a little awkward, considering the last time Harry saw Malfoy was at his family's trial. Harry had spoken up for him, but hadn't talked to him directly. Of course, at the time, they had been separated by the vast expanse of the Wizengamot courtroom. Now, they're separated by a mere three tables.<br />
<br />
Honestly, even before the trial, Harry had thought about trying to clear the air between them. More out of necessity than anything else, but also because Malfoy doesn't seem to be quite as much of a prick anymore. He mostly just seems as though he's had the wind taken out of his sails, which Harry can certainly relate to. The only problem is that Harry's not entirely sure how Malfoy would react to an offer of peace. Well, he can guess-- a scoffing remark and a quick dismissal-- but Harry wants to try and approach him in the least offensive way possible, to avoid that outcome. He's not quite sure yet how to do that, but he's willing to try. <br />
<br />
His musings are interrupted by McGonagall clearing her throat. All the students in the Great Hall, Slytherins included, turn to face the sound.<br />
<br />
McGonagall slowly sweeps her eyes over the crowd, a terse set to her mouth, before beginning the traditional start-of-term welcome speech.<br />
<br />
Her words, however, are anything but traditional. &quot;Students, I know that this year is like no other. We have all faced significant challenges, and have overcome them.&quot; There's a quiet murmur among the hall, and McGonagall patiently waits for it to die down.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, I am so glad to see all of you here today, in one piece. You, dear students, are the future.&quot; She pauses to look at Harry, an unreadable look in her eye. Harry swallows thickly, meeting her gaze unsteadily. Her mouth twists, before she quickly continues her speech, as if nothing had happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;We, as the Wizarding World, have been through much turmoil over the past few years. However, I believe that together we can heal, and we can rebuild.&quot; She looks out to the crowd, raising her glass. &quot;To the new semester, and all that comes with it.&quot; The students, including Harry, echo the sentiment and begin eating, some with more enthusiasm than others. <br />
<br />
Harry reluctantly takes a bite of his turkey leg, simultaneously scanning the Gryffindor table for someone to talk to. Ginny's sitting on the other end, so even if he wanted to risk approaching her, he couldn't. Somehow, though, he's sat right next to the three first years, all of whom are looking at him with varying degrees of awe. The boy next to him reaches up to tug on the sleeve of Harry's robe. Harry wearily looks down at him, then back to his turkey leg. He tensely bites off a piece, resigned that his only hope for conversation is a twelve-year old boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Mr. Harry Potter, sir?&quot; The boy squeaks. Harry tries valiantly to repress a snort. Sir. Like he's a professor, or something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Harry is fine. What's your name?&quot; He replies, smiling to try and put the kid at ease. It must not work, because he still looks like he may pass out any second. The other two first years, both girls, watch on with thinly-veiled interest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Justin, sir.&quot; Poor Justin looks like he's about to vibrate right out of his seat. Harry nods at him and reluctantly holds his hand out to shake. Justin stares at his hand for a beat too long before returning the handshake weakly. &quot;Um, I just wanted to ask. Um. What was it like, fighting You-Know-Who?&quot; <br />
<br />
Harry blinks at Justin, surprised by his candor. He really didn't beat around the bush, did he? &quot;Er--&quot; <br />
<br />
He's thankfully interrupted by the voice of McGonagall, who he hadn't noticed approach the table. &quot;If you'll excuse me, boys, I would like to have a word with Mr. Potter in my office.&quot; Justin nods so vigorously Harry's a bit worried his head might fall off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Well, it was nice meeting you, Justin,&quot; Harry offers, standing up gratefully to follow McGonagall. Justin gives an enthusiastic wave in response as he leaves. Harry winces, then turns back to the hallway. He's not quite sure what McGonagall wants to talk about, given their strange moment during her speech. Maybe she wants to make him Head Boy? It would make sense, although Harry's not quite sure he wants the added responsibility. He mostly just wants to keep his head down this year and graduate without any added attention on him.<br />
<br />
When they reach McGonagall's office, though, Malfoy, of all people, is waiting for them, fidgeting wearily in McGonagall's pale blue Queen-Anne printed loveseat. Harry hadn't even noticed him leave the Great Hall, which is a bit surprising. Not that he was watching him, or anything. Malfoy seems just as taken off guard as Harry is, which brings Harry a good deal of comfort. At least he wasn't the only one completely in the dark regarding McGonagall's joint meeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's this about, Professor?&quot; Harry asks. McGonagall gestures for Harry to sit next to Malfoy, which he reluctantly does. He keeps a great deal of space in between them-- a difficult task, given the small size of the loveseat, but he manages. Malfoy doesn't quite look up to meet anyone's eye, instead keeping his gaze trained on his hands, which are folded politely in his lap. Harry regards him for a moment, almost wishing that he would look up and give one of his characteristic sneers. Or at least taunt him, something. It seems unnatural for Malfoy to be so still.<br />
<br />
McGonagall sits in her desk opposite to the loveseat, fixing them both with a serious stare. &quot;Mr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy. I've called you both here because I have an important task for you two.&quot; At this, Malfoy looks up.<br />
<br />
Harry leans forward, intrigued. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like you boys to deliver a message to Professor Dumbledore.&quot; Harry and Malfoy, startled, send each other confused glances before quickly looking away again.  Merlin, McGonagall's gone barmy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, Professor--&quot; Harry starts hesitantly. McGonagall clears her throat, waving away his concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am well aware that Albus is not with us anymore, Mr. Potter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy, brow furrowed, speaks up. &quot;How do you expect us to deliver the message, then?&quot; He pauses. &quot;Headmistress,&quot; he tacks on as an afterthought, almost respectfully.<br />
<br />
Harry blinks at him for a second, shocked silent by the uncharacteristic display. Merlin, Malfoy really must be out of it, if he's not even going to say anything rude to McGonagall.<br />
<br />
Then again, after his family's trial, Harry supposes Malfoy really can't say anything cruel, lest he wants to be thrown back in Azkaban.<br />
<br />
Still strange, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was rather getting to that, Mr. Malfoy,&quot; McGonagall replies, not unkindly. She holds out a familiar-looking timekeeping device and a rolled up piece of parchment. &quot;I would like you boys to go back in time precisely eighteen months and deliver my letter to Professor Dumbledore. It is urgent, and of the utmost importance that he receives it.&quot; Harry reaches out to take the items, feeling a little blindsided.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eighteen months, Professor? Isn't that a little risky, on a time turner?&quot; Harry can't help but dart a glance over at Malfoy, who's sitting like a rock in his corner of the loveseat. &quot;And, er-- why us, if you don't mind me asking?&quot; At this, Malfoy snorts. Harry feels his mouth twist a bit at the gesture, and he stubbornly tugs it back down. He wouldn't want Malfoy to think he's smiling at him, or anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why  me, I think you mean.&quot; Even as he says it, Malfoy's guarded demeanor drops just a bit, revealing a hint of confusion. It's such an alien expression on him that Harry stares, stricken, at the side of his face. Malfoy sneaks a look back at him, then drags his eyes back to McGonagall and continues, &quot;However, I would like to know as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
McGonagall sits up a bit straighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have done it myself, but eighteen months of travel is indeed troublesome for a witch of my age. You two are some of the most powerful young wizards I know. Together, you should have no difficulties completing this task.&quot; She turns to look at Malfoy. &quot;I am placing my trust in  both  of you. I hope that you will not let me down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy swallows and nods. McGonagall then turns to Harry, who hesitantly nods as well. He's certainly been through much worse, and it  would  be nice to see Dumbledore again, even if only for a short time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent.&quot; McGonagall claps her hands together. &quot;This should be a fairly quick and simple task. Please do not dally.&quot; Harry hums in agreement, and gets up to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, eighteen turns should do the trick. I've already set it to the preferred time frame.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry nods absently, only half-listening. He walks out into the corridor, Malfoy close on his heels.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've done this before, then?&quot; Malfoy asks him, staring nervously at the time turner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, on the day of Buckbeak's execution,&quot; Harry replies.<br />
<br />
Malfoy blinks uncomprehendingly. Harry doubts he even remembers Buckbeak at all, the sod. Maybe it was too traumatic of a memory for him, Harry thinks wryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well-- alright, then. I suppose you're the expert.&quot; Harry gets the feeling that the retort was supposed to sound sarcastic, but Malfoy mostly just sounds resigned. Harry holds up the time turner, inspecting it. It looks a little different from the one he and Hermoine used, and he can't quite figure out why. The basic design is the same, but something about the turning mechanism looks different. It'll work just the same, though, Harry supposes. <br />
<br />
Malfoy taps his foot impatiently. &quot;Well, we haven't got all day, Potter. Get on with it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Harry rolls his eyes. There Malfoy was. Harry had almost been worried, Merlin forbid.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going, relax.&quot; It was eighteen turns, right? One turn for each month, Harry guesses. Simple enough. He sets his fingers on the knob and begins to twist.  One, two, three-- <br />
<br />
Harry's interrupted by a whirlwind of arms and legs that he doesn't see coming until it's too late. &quot;Harry! I mean, Mr. Harry Potter, sir! I really wanted to talk to you about--&quot; Justin, in his hurry, knocks Harry right off his feet, the time turner clattering to the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;Justin, move!&quot; Harry shouts.<br />
<br />
Justin, eyes wide, scampers off down the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I'll talk to you later!&quot; He shouts over his shoulder. Harry groans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don't,&quot; he mutters under his breath. Malfoy lets out a quiet snicker. Wait-- Malfoy. The time turner! Fuck. Harry wildly searches the ground until he sees it. Only a few feet away, but still spinning like mad. Harry pales. <br />
<br />
&quot;Should it still be spinning like that?&quot; Malfoy asks weakly.  Definitely not, Harry thinks. At this rate, it would send them back to the beginning of bloody time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Malfoy, we have to slow it down!&quot; Harry yells over the growing racket of the time turner. Harry's not sure how, exactly, they're going to do that, but they have to try. Malfoy looks at him wildly, and hesitates for only a second before grabbing his arm. <br />
<br />
Harry looks at Malfoy's hand on his arm for a long, baffling moment. A strange feeling bubbles up in his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll be stronger together!&quot; Malfoy shouts. Oh. Right. The spell. Harry points his wand at the time turner, along with Malfoy.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Finite Incantatum!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
The time turner only seems to grow stronger. A bright light begins to glow out from the center of the device, reaching its edges over to Harry and Malfoy.  Fuck.  <br />
<br />
The last thing Harry sees is Malfoy's worried face, and then darkness. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bloody hell, mate. Where did they come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell if I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't that one look a little bit like...&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Merlin, he really does. The spitting image.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A cousin, maybe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so. I've met all of James' cousins.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A long-lost brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
A snort. &quot;Yeah, right.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;James? Why was Harry's dad there?<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot; Harry murmurs quietly. Is he dead?  Again?  Blimey, what a way to go. Death by time turner. Wait-- fuck! The time turner! Harry bolts upright.<br />
<br />
&quot;Malfoy?&quot; he spins around wildly to see Malfoy lying face down, seemingly unconscious. Bugger. &quot;Malfoy, wake up.&quot; Harry shakes his shoulder, trying not to grip too hard. <br />
<br />
Malfoy wrinkles his forehead, eyes fluttering open. &quot;Shove off, Potter,&quot; he grumbles, shrugging Harry's hand off his shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Malfoy? Potter?&quot; The voice from earlier asks. A familiar voice, now that Harry thinks about it. &quot;Sorry, who  are you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They just said, mate. You going deaf, as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sod off, Padfoot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Padfoot? Harry slowly raises his eyes to see--<br />
<br />
&quot;Sirius,&quot; Harry chokes out, stunned. He looks much younger than he was when Harry knew him, sporting a worn, patched leather jacket that Harry  knows  is against the Hogwarts dress code. <br />
<br />
Sirius raises an eyebrow, seemingly unfazed. &quot;That's me, alright. And you?&quot; Harry blinks at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um-- Harry. Potter.&quot; Malfoy snorts next to him, and Harry shoves at his shoulder lightly.<br />
<br />
Sirius raises an eyebrow. &quot;...Right. You related to James, then?&quot; <br />
<br />
Harry nearly trips in his haste to stand up. &quot;You could say that, yeah.&quot; Unthinkingly, he holds out a hand for Malfoy to take. Malfoy, to his credit, only stares at it for a second before grasping it delicately and pulling himself to his feet, immediately dropping his hand afterwards.<br />
<br />
Sirius stares at the two of them. &quot;Sure. What about you?&quot; He asks Malfoy.<br />
<br />
Malfoy draws himself up to his full height, appearing as dignified as one can be after being found unconscious in a school corridor. &quot;Draco Lucius Malfoy,&quot; he states primly. Sirius's eyebrows shoot up, and Harry suppresses a snicker. Badly, if Malfoy's glare is anything to go by.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucius? Well, I suppose I see the resemblance.&quot; For a moment, the three of them just stand there, staring at each other in silence. <br />
<br />
Someone clears their throat. &quot;Well, I don't mean to be rude, but where exactly did you two come from?&quot; Harry turns to the voice. He had almost forgotten that there was another person with them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Professor Lupin?&quot; Harry chokes out. Lupin stares back at him suspiciously.<br />
<br />
Malfoy shifts uncomfortably, looking over at Harry. &quot;Look, Potter, I know it's been a while since you've...  seen them,&quot; he pauses, and he and Harry both go quiet. Remembering. &quot;But can't you see you're confusing the bloody hell out of them?&quot; Oh. Right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Harry starts sheepishly. &quot;We've had a bit of an accident with a time turner. Do you know where Professor Dumbledore is?&quot; He can't stop looking at Sirius and Lupin, these unweathered, carefree versions of them that Harry never knew, and has only seen in pictures. They're around his age, maybe even younger. <br />
<br />
Sirius's eyebrows shoot up his forehead. &quot;A time turner? Blimey! Don't those only go back a few hours at a time?&quot; <br />
<br />
Lupin stares at Harry in thinly veiled shock. &quot;Does that mean you're James's, what-- son?&quot; Sirius falls silent, apparently having just realized this as well. Lupin's brow furrows. &quot;And did you call me  Professor?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Harry fidgets, suddenly unsure of how much he's supposed to tell them. He hadn't quite prepared for this type of situation. &quot;Um, yes. And... yes?&quot; he tries. Malfoy squints at him in disapproval. <br />
<br />
&quot;Potter, do you  ever think before you speak?&quot; <br />
<br />
Harry stares back at him hopelessly. &quot;Honestly? Not really.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sirius snorts with laughter. &quot;Well, that's definitely James's son.&quot; He and Lupin share a bemused glance. &quot;Let's get you two to Dumbledore then, I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they walk down the corridor, Lupin glances over at Harry. He looks like he wants to ask something, but isn't quite sure if he should. After a minute or two of furtive side looks, Harry takes pity on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something you wanted to ask me? Um, Remus?&quot; It feels too strange to call someone his own age Professor. Besides, he wasn't a professor at all now, was he? Just a normal student, like Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Lily your mother? You have her eyes, is all.&quot; Harry smiles at the statement. (If he had a galleon for every time he heard it.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she is,&quot; he replies. Looking at Remus, the magnitude of the situation sinks in for the first time. If he and Malfoy are stuck here much longer, he could get to see his parents. Not in a dream, not as ghosts, but young and  alive.  Happy.<br />
<br />
The smile slowly slips from Harry's face, replaced by what he's sure must be an unattractively conflicted expression.<br />
<br />
Malfoy looks over at him, brow furrowed in something that resembles worry.  You okay? he mouths. Harry blinks in shock, then affirms the statement in a movement that probably looks more like a strange head spasm than a nod. He wonders if Malfoy is somehow...not himself. Some type of reverse demonic possession, maybe, where he's been replaced by a sort of caring and benevolent spirit.<br />
<br />
Having thankfully understood Harry's head spasm, Malfoy nods sharply in return, then quickly looks away, seemingly invested in the pattern of the floor.<br />
<br />
More attentively, Harry turns back to Remus. &quot;Why do you ask? Are her and dad not together yet?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, they are,&quot; Remus assures him. &quot;It's new, though.&quot; He pauses. &quot;They had a bit of a rocky start, but here we are, I suppose. Here... you are.&quot; With this, he makes a vague, wild gesture in Harry's direction, as if to say he's walking proof of his parents' relationship status. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here I am,&quot; Harry echoes. He's not quite sure how to feel about that statement.<br />
<br />
They spot Dumbledore before they reach his office. He's walking down the stairs with a much younger McGonagall, both engaged in an amicable conversation. They stop in their tracks when they see the group of teenagers approaching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear,&quot; says Dumbledore. &quot;You two look like you've had a bit of a chronological displacement.&quot; He waves McGonagall away in a kind but firm dismissal, then looks Harry and Draco up and down, and his eyes stop in their tracks at Harry's scar. &quot;You must be a very powerful wizard, Mr. Potter,&quot; he murmurs, his gaze still trained on Harry's forehead. <br />
<br />
Harry meets his eye. &quot;Not me. My mother,&quot; he says firmly. Harry certainly hadn't gotten the scar-- survived-- because anything he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes.&quot; Dumbledore looks at Harry once more, considering. &quot;Lily Evans, I presume. Well, I won't disagree. She is indeed a talented witch.&quot; Harry nods, throat suddenly tightening. He's unable to say anything else, but he can tell that Dumbledore understands. He looks at Harry with warm sympathy in his eyes. <br />
<br />
Dumbledore clears his throat. &quot;Well, now, please come into my office. I'll see what I can do for you.&quot; Malfoy, Sirius, and Remus, who had all been watching the conversation with varying degrees of confusion, snap to attention and follow Dumbledore as he leads the way.<br />
<br />
Once inside Dumbledore's office, the trio quickly takes their seats. Dumbledore regards Harry and Draco, waving his wand over them in a spiraling motion. &quot;Let's see. Harry Potter, son of James Potter and Lily Evans. Draco Malfoy, son of Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Black.&quot; Sirius startles at the sound of his cousin's name, and looks at Malfoy with renewed interest. Malfoy doesn't meet his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both eighteen years of age, both currently attending Hogwarts. Am I correct?&quot; Dumbledore peers over his glasses at them. Harry nods. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Professor. We had a bit of an accident with a time turner. We were instructed by Headmistress McGonagall--&quot; Malfoy elbows him sharply in the side, giving him a pointed look. Oh, bollocks. &quot;Er,  Professor McGonagall -- to give you this letter.&quot; Harry digs in his pocket for the letter and hands it to Dumbledore, who's chuckling at his slip-up. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's all right, Harry. I am quite aware that I will not live forever. Minerva will make a fine Headmistress in my stead.&quot; Next to them, Sirius makes a startled noise, and he and Remus glance, wide-eyed, at each other.<br />
<br />
Dumbledore opens the letter, adjusting his glasses slightly as he reads. There's a long silence, the air in the room turning stale and terse. Harry resists the urge to look over at Malfoy, and instead counts the number of grains in the wood flooring.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Dumbledore says eventually, looking troubled. &quot;Thank you for bringing this to my attention, boys.&quot; Harry and Malfoy nod hesitantly, neither one aware of the actual contents of the letter. <br />
<br />
To Harry's surprise, Malfoy speaks up, albeit quietly. &quot;Headmaster, do you know if we will be able to return to our proper time?&quot; <br />
<br />
Dumbledore hums thoughtfully. &quot;With wizards of your caliber, I believe it is possible. However, I will have to locate a rare type of time-turner to send you back. It will take a few weeks, at least. Professor McGonagall will fill in during my absence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy pales.  &quot;Weeks?&quot; <br />
<br />
Dumbledore nods, seemingly unconcerned. &quot;Until then, I see no reason for you all to not continue your education. You can join your respective houses and attend classes with the seventh-years. I'll arrange for extra school supplies and necessities to be sent up to the dorms.&quot; He conjures a quill and takes down a quick note on a nearby sheet of parchment, then looks back up at them. &quot;Am I correct in assuming Gryffindor and Slytherin?&quot; Harry and Draco both nod. &quot;Excellent.&quot; He finishes his note and hands it to a nearby owl to be delivered.<br />
<br />
Dumbledore turns to Sirius and Remus. &quot;I would like you boys to look out for them, along with their parents. I trust that you will be hospitable during their stay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sirius grins. &quot;Yes, sir. Just wait until James and Lily hear about this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry's eyes widen. Yes, indeed.<br />
<br />
Here's the first chapter! I can't promise super frequent updates, unfortunately, but I do already have part of the next chapter written, so that one should be up fairly quickly. I hope you guys like it so far!<br />
<br />
- H<br />
<br />
Meeting the parents and a totally non-romantic game of Quidditch.<br />
<br />
<br />
(See the end of the chapter for notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry,  what?&quot; <br />
<br />
Harry fidgets uncomfortably from his spot in the Gryffindor common room, wishing he could sink right into the floor. He blinks back at Lily, who's currently watching him with wide eyes that do, in fact, look exactly like Harry's. &quot;Er. I'm your son? From the future. I had a bit of an accident with a time turner, see, and now I'm... here,&quot; he trails off awkwardly.<br />
<br />
James blinks at him from his position on the couch, seemingly at a loss for words. After a moment, his open mouth turns into a sideways grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm a little young to be a father, but it's a pleasure to meet you, Harry. Say, how are you at Quidditch? We're having a game tonight.&quot; James leans back on the couch, slinging an arm around Lily, which she promptly shoves off.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you being so calm about this, James?&quot; She runs a hand through her hair and exhales sharply. &quot;Our son. Our son. Merlin. How do we know this isn't a trick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sirius shrugs. &quot;Dumbledore already vetted him.&quot; He winks at Harry, and Harry smiles back tentatively. It'd been so nice to see Sirius again, even if it was a much younger, much less mature version of him. Harry and Sirius had talked on the way to the Gryffindor dorms, and Harry had been pleasantly surprised at how easily the conversation flowed. Sirius had rattled on happily about the newest Muggle rock bands he was listening to, and had even offered for Harry to come to a concert with him sometime. Of course, Harry was sure (or he hoped, at least) that he wouldn't be stuck in the past for long enough to take him up on the offer, but still. It was nice of him.<br />
<br />
Sirius moves to stand beside Harry, ruffling his hair. &quot;Besides, he seems pretty cool. Even for being your son, Lils.&quot; Lily scowls at him.<br />
<br />
Harry watches the exchange with interest. His parents are so...  young. So normal. In only three years, they would be dead. Shit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do you say? Quidditch?&quot; James' voice breaks Harry out of his morbid thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm, I would love to play sometime. It's been a little while since I've been on the field, but if you've got a snitch, I'm good to go.&quot; <br />
<br />
Harry still doesn't know what to say to Lily, who seems to be on the verge of a Hermione-style breakdown. Harry has the feeling that anything he says will probably only freak her out more. Maybe he should just wait her out. That always seems to work with Hermione.<br />
<br />
In contrast to Lily's growing anxiety, James is practically bouncing with excitement. &quot;You're a seeker? Brilliant! Well, I'm a bloody good chaser, if I do say so myself.&quot; Lily rolls her eyes at that, and James turns to wink at her before looking back at Harry. &quot;We can invite your friend over to join, too, the one that came with you. What position does he play?&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy had indeed met James and Lily, for about five minutes before he hurriedly rushed off to the Slytherin dorms. Harry hadn't quite been able to get a read on him, how he felt about this whole time travel situation. He did feel a bit bad. Admittedly, Malfoy had enough on his plate without this whole mess to add to it. <br />
<br />
In an attempt to get comfortable, Harry settles down on a quilted chair in the corner of the room. &quot;Er, he's not exactly my friend. He's the Slytherin Seeker, though.&quot; Or,  was, rather. Harry doubted that Quidditch would even be happening this year, with the limited attendance at Hogwarts.<br />
<br />
With narrowed eyes, James nods. &quot;Ah. He's Lucius's son, right? And a Slytherin, too. No surprise there. Probably a proper brat, then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sirius snorts lightly in agreement. <br />
<br />
Harry thinks back to Lucius. Draco may take after him a bit, but Harry thinks that he may be better than his father in the ways that really counted. A fair degree braver, at least. And, from what Harry had seen at the trials, he did seem to genuinely want to make up for his actions during the war, which couldn't be said about Lucius.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's not quite as bad,&quot; Harry hedges, feeling an odd need to defend Malfoy. &quot;We just don't run in the same circles, really.&quot; He wants to laugh. Isn't  that  the understatement of the year. Sure, they ran in different circles, if the circles were defined as opposite sides of the war rather than school friend groups.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough, I suppose,&quot; James allows. &quot;We do need to round out the team, so we'll invite him then, if he isn't a prick. And Remus and Sirius too, of course.&quot; Remus and Sirius, for their part, don't look too enthused about this development.<br />
<br />
Looking up from the book he's reading, Remus raises an unimpressed eyebrow. &quot;You do know it's nearly Christmas, James? It's going to be bloody freezing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be such a downer, Moony. I just want to play a game of Quidditch with my son.&quot; James directs a conspiratorial grin at Harry. <br />
<br />
Lily, seemingly having processed her ongoing mental breakdown, or at least tabled it for the moment, plops down next to Harry. &quot;You're in seventh year, is that right?&quot; she asks. Harry nods hesitantly, still unsure how to act around her. Anyways, Harry's technically in eighth year, but he's not sure how to explain that without mentioning the war that stole away his seventh year, so he doesn't.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you started studying for NEWTS, then? I'm trying to go for a double charms and potions mastery, myself.&quot; Involuntarily, Harry lets out a small, impressed sound. His mother  definitely  reminds him of Hermoine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the term just started,&quot; Harry starts, breaking off when Lily continues to look at him expectantly. &quot;But, er, I'm quite good at Defense, and I'm alright at Charms. I'm pants at Potions, though. Didn't even qualify to take the NEWTS.&quot; Lily nods, seemingly satisfied.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's alright. Potions is a difficult subject. We can study for Charms together, if you want. None of these slackers,&quot; at this she glares at the rest of the Marauders, &quot;ever want to study with me. Except Remus, that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Remus sheepishly looks up from his textbook. &quot;She's right about that,&quot; he mumbles, before returning to his reading.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Harry isn't much for studying, either. He's always been more of a learn-on-the-go type of person. He's had to be, really. But hell if he's not going to jump at the one opportunity he's ever had to bond with his mum.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd love to,&quot; he replies, his answering smile only slightly forced at the prospect of studying. He catches James' eye, who's looking at him knowingly, a smirk on his face. Harry fights down a laugh. He has a feeling they'll get on just fine. <br />
<br />
Sirius clears his throat. &quot;While this is all quite fascinating,&quot; he drawls, &quot;I have much more exciting news.&quot; Lily raises an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; she says. &quot;More exciting than my son time-travelling from the future? Please, Sirius, enlighten us.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sirius takes this in stride and leans forward intently, elbows on his knees. &quot;Well, I was on my way to Potions, minding my very own business, and you'll never  believe  what I saw.&quot;<br />
<br />
Remus glances up from his book. &quot;What did you see, Sirius?&quot; he asks flatly. Sirius is wholly unfazed by the lack of reaction, keeping with the same level of energy that he had before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw our very own Peter Pettigrew and the lovely Alice Cooper...  snogging!&quot;  Sirius takes in the shocked expressions of the marauders, looking extremely pleased with himself.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
You rerouted the course of my self-determined path.<br />
Over the past year, I have often found myself contemplating the moment which it happened.<br />
And I think...<br />
Perhaps...<br />
That maybe it was that day we had our first date.<br />
Do you remember, my love?<br />
When you showed up with flowers and rather nervous.<br />
Or maybe...<br />
It was that night, when we shared our first kiss.<br />
But it could have also been the day I truly fell in love with you.<br />
Or the day I at least realized I was in love with you...<br />
for my heart has always known it, it was my brain that needed to come to terms with it.<br />
Yet when I truly trace back the moments we have shared,<br />
I am more and more convinced that my life was forever altered<br />
that day you and I locked eyes while we each stood on opposite ends of your staircase.<br />
I, as usual, was reluctant and uncertain... afraid you could say.<br />
And maybe you were able to interpret all of that.<br />
But I remember what message was transmitted in your gaze.<br />
Determination.<br />
Disbelief.<br />
Possibilities.<br />
You saw the future of 'us' in that moment.<br />
All before you even knew my name...<br />
I didn't know it then... wouldn't have believed it then if anyone had tried to tell me otherwise,<br />
but that was the last moment I would ever spend in my ordinary life.<br />
You half-stumbled, half-slithered your way into my guarded heart in ways that no one else ever could.<br />
What you saw that night... I will never truly know.<br />
But one thing is certain.<br />
You rerouted my path permanently.<br />
You pulled me out of a sure-to-be boring, uneventful, cautious route<br />
into one that was rocky, thorny, and uncertain...<br />
Yet beautiful.<br />
Because you were there. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
<br />
One Year Ago...<br />
<br />
<br />
Raven burst into the room with such pizzazz that it sent the door swinging into the wall, colliding with such intensity it poked a hole straight through it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess where you'll be on Saturday, April 15th at approximately 7 Post-Meridian Pacific Standard Time?&quot; She asked loudly, grinning unashamedly at the frightened blonde.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raven! Do NOT give me any more reasons to take away your key! Please learn the fine art of knocking!&quot; Clarke responded, not bothering to leave her chair, where she slumped atop the many books and laptop on her cluttered desk. &quot;I'll be studying. For a Midterm. You should know that because you'll be doing the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Negative, blondie! Gosh you suck at this...&quot; Raven sighed, walking towards Clarke and throwing a gold envelope on top of her chemistry - wait, no, biology? Raven shrugged, something sciency - textbook.<br />
<br />
&quot;You, princess, will be attending the highly anticipated, outrageous, out of this world - wait for it - Annual Wood's Birthday Extravaganza!&quot; She finished with both arms stretched towards Clarke, hands splayed and fingers wiggling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come again?&quot; Clarke narrowed her eyes; glaring at Raven in honest confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gahh! Keep up! You know, for a self-proclaimed genius, you sure don't live up to the title.&quot; Raven teased, opening the envelope for Clarke and waving the invitation in front of her still confused face. &quot;Lexa Woods! The richest, brattiest, most envied senior in all of UCLA...? It's her birthday!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I care because...?&quot; Clarke blinked a few times, still failing to process the reason for Raven's overly eager attitude.<br />
<br />
&quot;What! How long have you been cooped away in this gloom room of doom?&quot; She replied, shaking her head in utter shame. &quot;Sheesh, no wonder you're still single.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Leave my love life out of this and just cut to the point, Reyes. I have studying to get done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;LEXAAA WOOODSSSSS!&quot; Raven continued, sounding an awful lot like Dory from Finding Nemo. &quot;Rich bitty...you're in biology with her! It's her birthday and she invited us! Well, me... because I actually try to make friends. But you're my 'Plus One' soooo, you comin'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! Yea keep dreaming, Ray.&quot; Clarke scoffed at the idea; the absurdity of it all baffling her. &quot;Not gonna happen.&quot; She stated, rotating in her chair to face her computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw that's too bad... And too late!&quot; She smiled, turning to leave, tossing the invite on Clarke's desk. &quot;I already RSVP'd for us both... So... Yea, good talk.&quot; And she bolted out of the room, crashing into Aden right as she turned the corner out of the bedroom. &quot;OUCH! Watch where you're going, you little brat!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ME? You ran into me, you uncoordinated moron!&quot; He replied, followed immediately by an &quot;OW! You'll pay for that, Raven!&quot; Aden growled as Raven swatted the back of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't make me give you another Dutch Oven, you little turd!&quot; Raven threatened, causing Aden to gag in response; reimagining the scenario. &quot;Yea, that's what I thought...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both of you be quiet!...and both of you watch your language!&quot; Clarke chided them, still curiously analyzing the envelope Raven left behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this the thank you I get for trying to rescue you from your boring life!?&quot; Raven responded, huffing from frustration. &quot;Well... YOU are hereby dismissed as my charity case!&quot;<br />
<br />
Clarke shook her head, smiling at Raven's goofiness. She picked up the invite, noticing how each word was handwritten in black ink onto sturdy, sparkling, gold-tinted paper in perfect symmetry-<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Miss Raven Reyes<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Congratulations! <br />
<br />

Clarke sighed. She tossed the invitation aside and was about to dive back into her books when Aden burst into her room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Clarke!&quot; He blurted, hair fussed and face flushed. A frown plastered on his young face. &quot;Please go get Raven out of my room! She's not letting me do homework and keeps farting all over the place!&quot; He tossed his arms up in the air to illustrate frustration, eyes pleading for mercy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You little liar! He was playing Call of Duty when I walked in, Clarke! Didn't see a single book open!&quot; Raven chimed in from his room across the hall. &quot;He's just mad because I took over the game and I am whooping his A--BUTT!...But A for effort, kid! You should really consider a career in acting!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you should consider getting a career!&quot; Aden shouted back, shaking his head in disapproval. &quot;Freeloader!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Parasite!&quot; Raven yelled back from his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough. Aden, no games until your homework is finished. You know better.&quot; Clarke scolded, softening her expressions when she saw his disappointment. &quot;...And AGAIN watch your language REYES!&quot; The blonde yelled across the hall to her friend who was still in Aden's room, most likely still playing the kid's game.<br />
<br />
Turning to the boy she smiled and asked, &quot;What do you want for dinner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pizza!&quot; She heard Raven yell from across the hall, in near-perfect synchrony with Aden, causing a groan to escape from Clarke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear, sometimes it feels like I'm taking care of two kids!&quot; She whined, taking another glance at the invitation before exiting her room for the kitchen, a thought for another day.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&quot;Aunt Indra!&quot; Lexa called, as she stepped through the massive, double-glass door trimmed with dark wood. Her voice echoing off of the colossal marble walls in the grand foyer of the mansion; a glass dome and a glittering chandelier hung above, both impressing and intimidating visitors in equal measure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kitchen!&quot; A voice shouted in response, and she walked past the dual spiral staircase that led to the upstairs part of the house in its direction. There, she found a hunched Indra, apron on and focused, as she carefully placed the last layer of pasta on the lasagna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indra, we have cooks. Why do you insist on slaving away in the kitchen when that's what they're paid to do?&quot; Lexa questioned, opening a 1953 bottle of imported scotch and pouring herself a generous portion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because...&quot; Indra responded, a smile framing her still youthful face as she worked. &quot;I just happen to know how much you love my lasagna.&quot; She looked up at Lexa, smile immediately collapsing as she watched her toss back the liquor. &quot;Lexa... I thought we agreed that you would at least make an effort to control the urges.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lexa nodded, ignoring Indra's devastated look and poured herself another portion.<br />
<br />
&quot;We did and I am.&quot; She responded, tossing it back and swallowing the burning fluid in one gulp. &quot;Today, I'm having just two instead of three.&quot; She smirked, proud at her witty response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any news from the tailor? I need my outfit ready at least a week before my party, Indra. What about the musician? Did we get Justin or not? ...I swear performers are such a pain to deal with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Performers aren't the only ones...&quot; Indra whispered to herself, chuckling as she did. &quot;The tailor will have the outfit ready on the 5th, so there's still plenty of time. As for Justin, he's trying to rearrange his tour schedule in order to squeeze us in. I will be hearing from his manager within the week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Squeeze us in? Who the fuck does he think we are! You know what, cancel him. I want Katy Perry instead.&quot; Lexa waved a hand in dismissal, fingers twitching to grasp the bottle once more but preventing herself from doing so. &quot;She's a better entertainer and much sexier to look at anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, child. Everything will be perfect for your party.&quot; Indra soothed her, using a timid tone that always urged an innocent response from Lexa, her own special weapon to calm the spirited girl since she was a toddler. She paused her movements for a moment, analyzing Lexa where she stood leaning against the granite counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes I see you and I have a difficult time processing how much you've grown... what a beautiful and strong young woman you've become.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lexa's eyes met hers and Indra thought she saw a flash of emotions penetrate through the guarded, emerald eyes. &quot;Your parents would have been proud, child.&quot;<br />
<br />
The flash of emotions lingered for another second before it vanished; stare hardening to its original form once it passed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Proud? Of what, exactly? That their only daughter is a drunk, a womanizer, and spending their life's work on lavish parties and cars?&quot; She scoffed, caving into the urge and pouring herself another drink, quickly bringing it up to her impatient lips. &quot;Highly doubt it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and speaking of womanizing,&quot; Lexa continued, swiftly changing the subject, &quot;I'm having a girl over tonight. Suzy, or Sandra, or- who the hell cares. In case you want to retreat to the basement so you don't complain that I keep you up late.&quot; And with a wink and her infamous mischievous smirk, Lexa walked away before Indra had a chance to say anything further.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&quot;This will cost you Aden-soccer-duty for two months, Raven!&quot; Clarke hissed, trying to focus on her walk, which was highly compromised by the 4-inch heels Raven suggested she wear (and by 'suggesting' meaning throwing it at Clarke with a 'Got those for you. You're welcome.'), while straining to breathe at the impossibly tight dress Raven insisted she purchase (and by 'insisting' meaning buying it for her and then threatening to send her distant, workaholic mother an email stating that Aden was being starved and urging the woman to come home if she refused to wear it)... so she sucked it up and slid into the limo after her dashing, cunning, manipulative best friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I love the brat. He gets me! ...You know we talk mad crap about you when you're not around right?&quot; She joked, elbowing Clarke at her own smugness.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two talk mad crap about me to my face, so no, that doesn't surprise me.&quot; Clarke said while rolling her eyes at her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, just try and have a good time tonight. It will be fun!... Won't kill you to let loose once in a while... Oh, and I brought along my purse in case we see knickknacks that we can snatch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clarke rolled her eyes again. &quot;You're already filthy rich... you can retire that high school habit of yours, Ray.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, well, old habits die hard. Plus,&quot; She said, left hand gently tapping her left leg, which was sheathed in a metal brace, &quot;makes me think of how we used to be in the old days, ya know. Raven and Clarke- a modern Bonnie and Clyde but prettier and with more UNF!&quot; She winked and smiled, spirits high and hardly ever dismayed by anything.<br />
<br />
The limo slowed to a crawl roughly a few minutes later as it approached a massive, 10-feet tall, wrought iron gate with gold decor splashed against the black metal. Clarke stared in awe, registering the large 'W' resting in an ovular frame on top of the gate as it parted to allow them entry. Raven bounced excitedly on the seat next to her, champagne glass in hand spilling its contents all over the carpeted limo floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;HOLY SHIT!&quot; She exclaimed, eyes wide in excitement. &quot;Man, and I thought I was swimming in dough! This lucky bitch probably needs to use Waze to get from her bedroom to the crapper in this place!&quot;<br />
<br />
From the distance, as the limo drove down the lengthy driveway, the glamorous Wood's mansion blossomed into view, sucking away Clarke's breath at the sight. It resembled less of a mansion and more of a palace, modern yet similar to something you'd expect out of The Great Gatsby. Every light, in every room, was on and the exterior of the mansion was ornamented with flashing white lights.<br />
<br />
The chauffeur pulled to a stop in front of the granite staircase leading to the entrance of the house, and almost instantly the door of the limo was pulled open by servants in black and gold tuxedos, extending a hand first to Clarke, then to Raven, and helping them out of the vehicle. Another servant, standing a few feet away, carried a tray with champagne glasses, handing each of the women a glass.<br />
<br />
The double doors were pulled open as they approached, doormen bowing to them in a welcome as they entered the impressive foyer. This moment, the moment Clarke's eyes scanned the interior of the house, the moment it gazed upon the impeccably dressed attendees that loitered around her, was the first time her jaw dropped open in sheer admiration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy-&quot; Clarke started...<br />
<br />
&quot;Dog turd.&quot; Raven finished, classy as usual. &quot;And to think... all she had to do was be squeezed out of her mothers' vagina to get all of this... how is that fair?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both her parents had to die for her to get all of this, Ray... I hardly think it's fair.&quot; Clarke responded back quietly, feeling a pang of sorrow for the girl; a stranger she never met and never heard of, until recently. Raven looked at her questioningly, intrigued at how Clarke knew the details about the splendid, yet tragic life of Lexa Woods.<br />
<br />
Clarke shrugged, giving Raven a smug but serious smile. &quot;Google.&quot;<br />
<br />
They moved to the main hall, where people flowed in and out of the vast ballroom, Clarke immediately noticing that majority of the attendees were the upper, snobby portion of her UCLA colleagues - people Clarke and Raven had nothing in common with nor associated with by any means. The men were dressed in the finest suits and tux designed in Beverly Hills, accented with a tie -either traditional or bow- and postures that not only screamed 'old money', it reeked of it. The women wore dresses that appeared to be uniquely crafted and designed with only that individual in mind, beautiful and prestigious. There was an array of colors in dresses- navy blue, red, black (like Clarke's), gold, silver (like Raven's), and so on. Yet the most intriguing feature of anyone's outfit was, without a doubt, the mask each person sported; effectively concealing the identity of it's owner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I'd love to drop one of my homemade stink bombs in here.&quot; Raven said, chuckling at her own joke. &quot;I'd happily go to jail for a night if it came to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, we didn't have to come... You're the one who practically dragged us here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For the knickknacks, Griffin!&quot; Raven responded, as if it was obvious to everyone but Clarke. &quot;I want a souvenir before the night is over.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ballroom was equally stunning. There were tables placed along the walls, candles and flower petals decorated the center, and near the entrance to the room a long table rested, decked with a variety of finger foods and deserts. On the opposite side was a small, but plentiful bar with a bartender serving beverages ranging from soft drinks to hard liquor. Music was blasting via surround speakers, and a small crowd danced to its tunes in the center of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright here's an idea...if we get separated, lost, or somehow dragged to the dance floor by persistent, drunk weirdos, we need a rendezvous spot.&quot; Raven plotted, not a second went by before she found a solution. &quot;I vote the bar. Let's go scope it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
They each had two drinks, and Raven was in the process of ordering a third when a loud screech cut through the music and a familiar voice erupted from the stage at the far end of the room, causing Clarke's eyes to widen at the sight. &quot;Is that...?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening, Ladies and Gents!&quot; Katy Perry announced, flashing the cheering crowd a dazzling smile. &quot;Welcome, all, to Lexa's twenty- third birthday party! Who's excited to be here?&quot; She asked, receiving louder cheers and applauses. &quot;Lexa personally invited me here tonight and I could not be happier to be able to celebrate such a special day with such an incredible woman, so I propose a toast!&quot; She chimed, lifting a glass of champagne to the crowd, where a group of people surrounded a figure Clarke assumed to be Lexa but couldn't see past the bodies. &quot;To Lexa!...&quot; the crowd chanted back, hands rising into the air with glasses and cups. &quot;...In life, may you find your purpose. In love, may you find your heart. Good fortune on your journey, and always remember...an end is only a start. Happy birthday, Lex!&quot; Katy finished, earning more cheers and applauses from the crowd. &quot;We have an eventful evening planned for you all tonight, so enjoy, let loose, and of course, have fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pairs gathered at the center to dance and cheer as the performer began to sing, Clarke and Raven quickly jumping in and singing along.<br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK YES, KATY PERRY!&quot; Raven shouted, singing out-of-pitch and slurring her words, the sound coming out of her mouth turning heads and earning her curious looks. &quot;'You'ust gotta iniiiiiite da liiiiiight. And let it shaaaane. Just ooooo da niiiiight. Like the fork of Julaaaaahhh!'&quot;<br />
<br />
After a few more drinks, Raven decided she had enough of Katy and the suffocating crowd. &quot;Griffin! Operation Knick a Knickknack is on! Vamos! Rapido!&quot; She tugged Clarke out of the ballroom with the pretense of heading for the nearest restroom, but redirected towards the foyer which was currently vacant when she confirmed they were in the clear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ray, this isn't one of your brightest ideas and I'm calling you out on it.&quot; Clarke tried to reason with her, but she knew it was a pointless effort.<br />
<br />
&quot;One teeny, weeny little souvenir! That's it, then we leave!&quot; Raven was already climbing one of the double staircases towards the second level, leaving Clarke no choice but to follow in pursuit. Once there, she went for the nearest door, expectations high and showing, and walked into what seemed to be a guest bedroom. She closed the door, uninterested. &quot;Too impersonal. Next.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Raven! Just grab whatever and lets go before someone finds us!&quot; Clarke begged, watching as Raven opened and closed another door farther ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bathroom.&quot; She said in explanation, opening yet another door. &quot;Aha! Here. We. Go.&quot; And she moved in. Clarke followed. The room was strange to say the least; a single, long shelf ran along its walls, decorated with different trinkets and items that made no sense in the slightest. Raven grabbed a silver, flower-shaped brooch, covered in small crystals. &quot;Got it! Let's bounce! I wanna try and get a selfie with Katy before she leaves!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Raven maybe you shouldn't... that seems expensive, we can get in a lot of trouble if-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, Princess. Look at all the crap on these shelves. She'll never even miss it, I promise!&quot; So after surrendering to Raven's appeal, they left. Clarke took another glance at the strange room before shutting the lights and pulling the door closed; ignoring the uneasy feeling looming from the unwarranted discovery.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Indra waited until the coast was clear before firmly grabbing Lexa's arm and pulling her to the foyer, where they could have a private moment free from wandering eyes. &quot;How many drinks have you had, Lexa, and God help you if you lie to me, girl.&quot; Indra hissed, tone angry and serious, but not appearing to frighten the grinning, swaying brunette in the least bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, um let's see... I was never the best mathematician, but according to my calculations, roughly... seven...?&quot; She spoke, words slurring and breath stinking of gin, presenting Indra with ten fingers instead of seven.<br />
<br />
&quot;You foolish girl! You were in there groping that girl...and lucky for you I caught you before you were able to slip your foul hands under her dress...Lexa, you cannot go around acting like this, do you hear me?!&quot; Indra asked bewildered, shaking her head, a little terrified at Lexa's poor behavior. &quot;This isn't a game, child! This is serious and you can get in real trouble!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was practically begging for it... they always do, so relax Indra, no harm done. She's probably looking for me to finish what I started so...&quot; She took a step back, indicating she was done with this conversation, and she saw Indra move to stop her, to keep her from leaving, but it wasn't Indra's attempt that rooted her in place; her feet suddenly feeling like it was cemented to the floor beneath and unable to budge.<br />
<br />
Her eyes drifted to the top of the staircase, where she saw the most breathtaking figure descend to where she stood; golden hair flowing freely from her movements, long dress cascading off each step behind her in such a magical way, Lexa thought it was an illusion. Lexa's eyes hungrily scanned the length of the toned and curvaceous body, noticing the dangerous yet alluring opening that dipped down her chest, exposing the top and side of her full breasts. Even though her face was hidden behind a pearly white mask, her lively blue eyes pierced through it, causing Lexa to instantly forget how to breathe.<br />
<br />
She suddenly felt broken yet unexplainably sober; knees unlocking and beginning to weaken, throat dry and raspy, and eyes beginning to sting - refusing to blink and cause the image to disappear, afraid it was another drunken apparition. But it wasn't. She knew the moment those solid, bright eyes finally found hers and connected. The moment blue and green met and held the other's stare, neither wanting to linger but finding it impossible to break contact. The girl, whoever she was, stopped dead in her track, returning Lexa's fiery gaze in equal fervor.<br />
<br />
And at that moment, as Lexa would soon discover, was the turning point in her life; the moment she crossed paths with this goddess whom she had yet to meet. She didn't care about anything else that second...all she cared about was getting to know this stranger that was making her heart pump a bit faster and her palms to become moist...all she cared about was getting to know the girl behind the mask.<br />

<br />
<br />
Right there, pinned under the intense stare from the green-eyed, masked stranger perched at the base of the spiral staircase, was when Clarke felt her jaw drop for the second time that evening. She quickly regained control over it and snapped it shut before her mouth could betray her further.<br />
<br />
Someone called up to them, tone sounding irritated and angry, but Clarke's focus was entirely devoted to the figure below, dressed in a perfectly fitting, all-white tuxedo and black stiletto high heels. She wore a black bowtie around her neck, which complemented her vicious yet beautifully designed black mask. She looked stunning, and Clarke did not have to ask who the woman- hair curled and tossed over her right shoulder, that stared up at her with such a fiery gaze- was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies! The second floor is out of bounds!&quot; A woman shouted up to her and Raven, finally pulling Clarke out of her enchantment. &quot;Do not make me repeat that again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indra, it's alright...&quot; Lexa spoke, placing a calming hand on Indra's arm, &quot;I gave them permission.&quot; She glanced back at the two, both still frozen in place, and winked at Clarke in a manner that insinuated she'd be paying her back later for the save.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh, yea, ma'am, our apologies...&quot; Raven jumped in, presenting the irate woman with a cheesy grin, slipping the hand still clutching the stolen brooch behind her back and climbing down the steps. &quot;We were, er- just heading back to the party.&quot; Raven confirmed, wrapping her free hand around Clarke's wrist and pulling her the rest of the way down, passing in between Lexa and Indra as they escaped to the ballroom.<br />
<br />
Clarke's eyes once again found Lexa's as she walked by, catching the faint smell of her scent that was an uneven mixture of lavender and bourbon. She kept walking, unsure whether out of her own will or because Raven still hauled her in the direction of the ballroom. But even as she walked away, she felt Lexa's gaze follow her until she was out of sight, and as tempted as she was to turn her neck and steal one more look at the woman that took her breath away, she refused to do so and allowed herself to be carted towards the still raving celebration.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lexa! Eyes on me, girl!&quot; Indra ordered, snapping her fingers in front of Lexa's face to grab her attention. &quot;I swear, you are worse than a teenage boy during puberty!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indra, I have to go... Can we raincheck this conversation? Thanks.&quot; She spoke, stepping away from Indra, ready to dash in pursuit-<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no... We are having this conversation NOW!&quot; Indra spoke, once again firmly holding Lexa's arm thus preventing her from moving. Lexa turned to face her, brows scrunched in a silent plea, bottom lip jutting forward in a pout.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, aunt Indra....it's my party!&quot; She tried, giving the woman her best 'I'm sowwy' face. Indra just shook her head, sighing and rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. But you best behave, child... do not let me catch you elbows deep up some poor girls' dress again or there will be hell to pay, you hear!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lexa furiously nodded her head in agreement, a smirk forming on her face at Indra who released her arm. &quot;That's why I love you!&quot; She leaned forward and gave the woman a grateful kiss on the cheek and left.<br />
<br />
Upon entering the ballroom, her eyes scanned it from end to end, gaze scrutinizing every blonde her eyes landed on in hopes she would be the one, but failing to locate the white-masked, blue-eyed beauty to her disappointment. She felt an arm drape heavily around her shoulder and turned to see Octavia, her longest and - at the current moment - most annoying best friend hand her a glass of water.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are! I've been looking everywhere for you, Lex. Here, drink, you need to sober up.&quot; She pushed the glass into Lexa's hand but when Lexa refused to take it, she handed it over to a butler walking by. &quot;Hey, c'mon I didn't see you eat anything all night, why don't we-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O, not now.&quot; Lexa cut her off, starting to feel the irritation coursing through her veins, fingers starting to twitch in search of a drink with a little more kick to it... &quot;Later, k.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok...everything alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; Yes she was mad, possibly borderline furious, a sensation she recently grew accustomed to due to its frequent occurrences.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright... when you're ready to stop being a bitch come find me.&quot; Octavia mumbled, disappearing into the massive crowd.<br />
<br />
Lexa felt slightly guilty, but it lasted only a second because there, near the stage where Katy Perry still performed, she saw her... black dress and white mask and loose blonde curls spilling down her back. Without realizing it, her breathing hitched, and she was powerless to do anything else at that moment other than stare in her direction- keenly observing her every movement, the way she stood slightly awkward beside her friend, who currently attempted to climb onto the stage forcing the blonde to pull her back down and frown from embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Lexa watched as some drunken idiot nearby bumped into the blushing girl, causing her to stumble forward in a momentary loss of balance, yet it was she who turned and apologized, placing a caring hand on his arm and asking the dumbfuck if he was ok. Lexa smiled; the adorableness of it all quickly abating the anger and replacing it with a foreign feeling she had not felt in a long time. That is, at least, until the dipshit decided to try his luck further and placed a tentative hand on her hip. Lexa watched closely, eyes probably scathing a hole through his core, as he pressed his hips against hers, eyes looking down at her as if she was a prize he would soon be polishing in the privacy of his bedroom. A thought crossed her still raging mind, well, maybe she is... maybe that's his girl.<br />
<br />
Her hands clenched into fists, jaw tightening and eyes blurring at the uncontrollable anger surging. The urge was spiking and she knew she wouldn't be able to resist it...<br />
<br />
Lexa walked to the bar where she ordered a round of shots, enough for six people, and downed each one without even pausing for a breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure left in a hurry earlier...&quot; a voice, husky and low, delivered to Lexa's ear seductively caught her attention. It was the girl Indra caught her getting frisky with earlier, in the middle of the dance floor - crap what was her name! &quot;I was thinking you could give me that tour you promised... I think now is a good time, don't you?&quot; She said, biting her lower lip and batting her eyes, a finger ran up the length of Lexa's arm slowly and she traced it with her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely...&quot; Lexa said, tossing back the last shot and grabbing her wrist, towing her out of the ballroom. &quot;We can start with the nearest closet.&quot;<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The door to the guest bathroom swung open and the sound of high heels stopping abruptly should have been enough to bring Lexa to pause, yet she refused to detach her ravenous lips from the neck they currently sucked on. Its owner -  fuck, what the hell was her name! - sat on the edge of the granite countertop, dress bunched up around her waist where Lexa's impatient hands had pushed it up, and her legs were parted and wrapped possessively around Lexa. Lexa's hands rested on her plump behind, where she kneaded the flesh roughly, pulling the girl's warm core flush against her toned stomach, grinding against her slowly. She felt the girl gasp and tense at the intrusion, and Lexa grumbled, clearly irritated at being interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Occupied!&quot; She rasped annoyed, voice muffled by the girl's neck, mask tossed aside to allow her to feast without any barriers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! I'm so sorry! I thought it was vacant...&quot; the intruder responded, sounding clearly embarrassed and overly apologetic.<br />
<br />
Frustrated and suddenly losing interest, she pulled away from the girl, and immediately regretted not having done so sooner. The gods, or spirits, or - whoever- must have a really sick sense of humor because the blushing, shock-stricken intruder standing awkwardly by the door was none other than the mysterious blonde, eyes wide in surprise behind her mask and mouth hanging open, causing a similar reaction from Lexa (except hers was out of stupidity rather than shock).<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey! We were-er, just leaving...please feel free to um...sorry about that.&quot; Lexa felt her body temperature start to scale, and she rubbed the back of her neck nervously in anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I-I should've knocked. I can go in the kitchen...&quot; The blonde said hurriedly, eyes shutting behind her mask as what she had just spoken dawned on her, &quot;... I meant, not go go in the kitchen...I just need the sink.&quot; Her ice-blue eyes shifted to where the sink was, swiftly averting to the floor once she made eye contact with the girl that still sat, almost naked, on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No...please, by all means...&quot; Lexa stepped aside, motioning with a subtle nod for the girl to step down. &quot;It's all yours.&quot; The girl, pulling down and adjusting her dress, moved out of her way, allowing her to pass by.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll um, see you back at the dance floor?&quot; The girl asked, starting to head for the exit, giving Lexa a wink and an unashamed grin.<br />
<br />
Lexa merely nodded, lingering a bit longer in the restroom after she had departed. &quot;Again, sorry... I was-we were-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, truly, you don't have to apologize...&quot; She said earnestly, giving the flushing brunette a smile- shy, yes, very bashful, Lexa thought- through the mirror. &quot;Sorry for interrupting...&quot;<br />
<br />
It took Lexa a moment to recover from the smile</td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">Sam gives a low whistle, eyeing the car up and down. &quot;We're not fitting in that thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Bucky says. Steve blinks. Bucky frowns. &quot;They won't be looking for it,&quot; he explains, shrugging.<br />
<br />
Sam nods in agreement. &quot;All right,&quot; he says, &quot;but I'm driving.&quot; Steve opens his mouth to protest, but Sam holds up a hand. &quot;I'm not squishing up next to either of y'all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve sighs. &quot;Let's just go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bucky glares at Sam, but there's something behind his eyes that isn't quite malice. He and Steve somehow manage to squish into the back of the car, elbows pressing up against one another. Bucky's legs fold up, knees pressing uncomfortably up against the back of Sam's seat. Sam decides against mentioning it.<br />
<br />
An hour away from the bolthole, Sam breaks the silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, are you two gonna talk, or?&quot; he says, looking in the rearview mirror. Steve is staring out the window, looking for all the world like he belongs in a soft, acoustic music video. Bucky is glaring directly at Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Sam says, &quot;okay, not talking is fine. Do you want the radio on, or something? You listen to that kinda stuff, right? Radio?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything but country,&quot; Bucky growls.<br />
<br />
&quot;See,&quot; Steve says, &quot;I told you we could trust him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bucky gives a smile- the same smile he'd given when the word newspapers had tumbled out of his mouth. Sam tears his eyes off the rearview mirror, because that smile is not for him, and quickly flicks the radio on. He flips through a few channels before landing on the classical music station, and he hears Steve shift in the seat behind him.<br />
<br />
Huh. Hundred-year-old man, likes classical music. Some of the stereotypes are true.<br />
<br />
But it's Bucky, not Steve, who starts humming along to the song.<br />
<br />
Sam doesn't have the faintest idea what it is- some piano song, or something- but Bucky seems to know it by heart. A glance in the rearview mirror, and he can see Steve staring at Bucky like he's just pronounced the cure for cancer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mozart?&quot; Steve asks.<br />
<br />
Bucky shakes his head. &quot;Clementi,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;All sounds the same to me,&quot; Steve says, and shrugs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clementi's happy,&quot; Bucky says. &quot;You can tell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Steve says, and that's the last any of them talk for another half hour.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Steve insists they're going to need fuel sooner or later, and that this might be their only chance to get it. A fifteen-minute argument results, ending with the mutual compromise of Starbucks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Sam says, squinting at the sign through the car window. &quot;So you wanted- what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grande, iced, sugar free, vanilla latte,&quot; Steve rattles off. &quot;With soy milk?&quot; he says, almost a question. Bucky nods. &quot;With soy milk,&quot; he says again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus,&quot; Sam mutters. &quot;You?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve studies the menu. &quot;Triple Venti, half sweet, nonfat caramel Macchiato.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How,&quot; Sam says, &quot;do you not know the difference between Star Wars and Star Trek, but you know what a Macchiato is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry up,&quot; Bucky says, kicking the back of Sam's seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're gonna need to write those down,&quot; Sam says, &quot;because there's no way in hell I'm rememberin' all of that crap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grande,&quot; Bucky growls. &quot;Iced. Sugar free. Vanilla. Latte.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam inches the car up to the ordering station and rolls down the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; he says, and the speaker shoots out static that he thinks translates into Welcome to Starbucks, can I take your order? <br />
<br />
He flicks his eyes up to the rearview mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says, &quot;I'll have two black coffees, Tall. And a croissant.&quot;<br />
<br />
The foot on the back of his chair presses so hard that his stomach brushes the edge of the steering wheel.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what,&quot; he says, &quot;better make those Short.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They're less than five minutes away from the rendezvous point Sharon had set up, when Steve grabs the back of the passenger side seat and looks intently at Sam through the rearview mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
Sam looks in the sideview mirror, but there's no sign of a physics-defying metal suit blazing up towards them. Relieved that they're not about to die, he looks in the rearview mirror and raises an eyebrow at Steve.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We should swap,&quot; Steve says.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Sam merges into the exit lane. Steve says nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; he elaborates, sparing a glance from the road to gape at Steve again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just think,&quot; Steve says, sitting back down and shrugging. &quot;You know, maybe- if we're meeting the rest of the team later, maybe-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to get out of the driver's seat,&quot; Sam realizes. &quot;You- oh my god.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just,&quot; Bucky says, as Steve opens his mouth. &quot;Just let him have this.&quot; Sam raises his other eyebrow in the mirror at Bucky, who rolls his eyes. &quot;He likes being dramatic,&quot; Bucky says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not dramatic,&quot; Steve says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stevie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve elbows Bucky. &quot;Don't Stevie me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam snorts. &quot;Right,&quot; he says, narrowing his eyes at Steve. &quot;Dramatic, right. I forgot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hard to believe you could work with him regularly and forget that,&quot; Bucky grumbles.<br />
<br />
&quot;I work with him on occasion, as an honorary Avenger-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're like an intern?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not an intern, I'm an-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you just pull over?&quot; Steve barks, and Sam swerves the tiny car over to the side of the road.<br />
<br />
Steve squeezes out of the car and clambers into the driver's seat. Bucky looks at the empty seat beside him, and then back up at Sam. His eyes darken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh uh,&quot; Sam says, &quot;I'm not sitting next to Red Scare.&quot; And he slides into the passenger seat, beside Steve. He thinks he hears a barely muffled snort behind him, but ignores it. Steve rolls his shoulders, still hunched over, and pulls the car back onto the road.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was,&quot; Sharon says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Late?&quot; he offers, and it's the wrong adjective. He barely knows what he says after that, and then Sharon's heading back into her car and he can do nothing but look back at the car. Sam is smiling smugly. Behind him, Bucky is just... staring.<br />
<br />
It's not quite a blank stare, though, so he decides not to worry about it. He heaves their supplies and uniforms into the trunk of the tiny car, and has to squish his own suit under the front seat to make everything fit, but somehow it all does fit. Sam and Bucky watch him grunt as he shoves what he can into the trunk, neither offering to help.<br />
<br />
Steve steps back into the car and closes the door, lips still tingling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't like blondes,&quot; Bucky says.<br />
<br />
Sam chokes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I,&quot; Steve splutters. &quot;I- I don't- I- what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't hurt yourself,&quot; Bucky says, snorting. &quot;S'just an observation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Steve says defensively, &quot;just because I liked Peggy doesn't mean I can't like- other- types of people-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Peggy, sure.&quot; Bucky shrugs. &quot;Peggy, and Howard, and Wilson, and Stark-&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve swerves the car into the next lane violently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold up,&quot; Sam says, and it's his turn to grab the back of the driver's seat and look increduously at Steve. Steve, whose face is rapidly beginning to resemble the inside of a freshly juiced grapefruit.  &quot;What was that about me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's got a type, s'all I'm sayin',&quot; Barnes says, shrugging.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not have a type.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You do,&quot; Bucky argues, &quot;tall, annoying, dark hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam twists his neck and narrows his eyes at Bucky. &quot;Kinda sounds like someone I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bucky's eyes look dangerous enough to throw knives. Considering the kind of training he's been through, Sam honestly wouldn't be surprised if they could.<br />
<br />
&quot;The point is,&quot; Bucky says, &quot;you don't like blondes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can like people if I want to,&quot; Steve splutters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Bucky says, and Sam begins to get the feeling that this conversation is becoming very, very entertaining for him. &quot;And if you don't want to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just-&quot; Steve swears loudly as a truck merges beside him, nearly clipping off the sideview mirrors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Language,&quot; Bucky says, before Sam can process the fact that Captain America is apparently well-versed in four letter words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suck a cock,&quot; Steve spits, and cuts the truck off. He gives a triumphant smirk and raises his foot. The speedometer falls fifteen notches. The truck honks behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to be a buzzkill,&quot; Sam says, &quot;but aren't we sort of on a time limit, here?&quot;<br />
<br />
The truck honks again, and Steve loses another five miles an hour.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brainwashed super soldiers,&quot; Sam says. &quot;Armed and dangerous. Ready to kill, like. Everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lane in front of Steve is nearly empty, now. The truck is tailing them closely, not leaving even a foot between their bumper and its front wheels. Steve grits his teeth, tightening his hands around the wheel, and Sam has a second to realize exactly what's about to happen before Steve slams his foot on the gas.<br />
<br />
The car shoots forward into the empty lane until it reaches the regular scramble of cars, then swerves left and right around them, barely dodging one, two, three possible firery car crash deaths along the way. Sam braces himself, one hand against the window, the other hand clamped so tightly around Steve's seatback that he's surprised his nails don't break through the upholstery.<br />
<br />
Steve takes their exit and swerves down the ramp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you,&quot; Bucky says, kicking his feet up on the back of Sam's seat. &quot;Dramatic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Sam says, uncurling his fingers one at a time from the seat. &quot;So what was that about me-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, what was that about 'I just'?&quot; Bucky interjects.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-uh,&quot; Sam says, turning back and pointing threateningly at Bucky. Bucky eyes his finger as if he's imagining all the ways he could break it. Or all the places it would fit nicely. Or both. &quot;Nuh-uh,&quot; Sam repeats. &quot;No way, you said Wilson, what the hell did you mean by-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Bucky says, shrugging. &quot;No, he was sayin' somethin', you're interrupting- and besides, I ain't saying anything about you and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you're implying,&quot; Sam says, shaking his finger in the air. &quot;Implying's worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Implying,&quot; Bucky agrees, rolling his eyes. &quot;You bring a thesaurus with you everywhere you go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You ever heard of reading?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't have much time for it, when I was learning how to kill you twenty six different ways with my bare hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a shame; I think a little Jane Austin woulda mellowed you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve skids to a stop at the light, and spins around so fast in his seat that the seatbelt feeder breaks off the wall. &quot;I will turn this car around!&quot; he shouts, slamming his hands down on the wheel. It creaks dangerously, and Steve wrenches his hands back.<br />
<br />
Sam bites his tongue- literally has to bite down on his tongue to keep from saying anything else. Bucky doesn't seem to be capable of the same show of self control.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean,&quot; he says, and Steve's thumbs begin pressing dents into the wheel. &quot;You never said I was wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't,&quot; Steve growls, &quot;have a type.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You kinda do,&quot; Bucky says. &quot;And that ain't what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean you don't like blondes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's the same thing as saying I have a type!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to give you a choice, Barnes.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Barnes-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You can shut your goddamn mouth for five minutes, or you can walk.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Sam says, looking between Bucky and Steve. Steve looks at him with an anger Sam has never, ever seen before. &quot;The, uh,&quot; he says, pointing at the windshield. &quot;The light's green.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve swivels his eyes at Bucky, who stares him back down. After a moment of silence, Steve's foot presses down on the gas and the car begins to turn. He doesn't take his eyes off Bucky's.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn signal,&quot; Bucky says.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Sam presses his face into his hands and prays. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
By the grace of God, Bucky and Steve somehow manage to scrape out of the airport alive. And with a fully intact jet, no less.<br />
<br />
Bucky sees the second Iron Man fall from the sky, sees the first Iron Man and Sam soar down to catch him. Sees the dent in the ground the second Iron Man makes, and knows that it's his fault.<br />
<br />
If Steve sees it too, he doesn't say anything.<br />
<br />
They waste an hour in the air before there's any sound in the plane besides the wind against the windows. Bucky, half tempted to curl up on the floor and fall asleep for five goddamn minutes, sits up a little. He's gotten by with less sleep and less fuel than this before, and the adrenaline of finally catching this asshole is enough to keep him up and running for as long as he needs to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your friends,&quot; he says, remembering them. &quot;What will happen to them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever it is,&quot; Steve says, and takes a moment to find the right words. &quot;They'll... deal with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bucky chews his lip. He remembers the archer, how he'd agreed to sacrifice his freedom in place of theirs. He doesn't even know the archer's name.<br />
<br />
Barton, Clint, something in his mind supplies. He tries to ignore it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; he says, &quot;maybe I'm not worth all this, Steve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Buck,&quot; Steve says. &quot;Buck, everything that happened... it wasn't your fault. It wasn't you. HYDRA made you do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; Bucky nods to himself. &quot;But I still did it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The silence comes back again, and the jacket feels tight over Bucky's chest. The plane feels smaller, somehow.<br />
<br />
Jets like these, Bucky realizes, must not get turbulance. It's advanced, more advanced than the helicopter he now remembers trying to steal. He doesn't remember where he'd intended to go with it. This plane stays smooth through the air, as they soar over clouds and cities. He barely hears the rain splatter against the reinforced glass as they pass through a low hanging cloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Steve says, &quot;blondes?&quot;<br />
<br />
It takes a moment for Bucky to understand what Steve means. When he does, he snorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Steve says, &quot;you had me interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted to get Wilson's nerves down,&quot; Bucky says, shrugging.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh, sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's better at hiding in plain sight than you are,&quot; Bucky points out. Steve opens his mouth to say hey, but Bucky runs him over. &quot;Still sticks out like a sore thumb, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So your solution was to get him angry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My solution was to get him comfortable.&quot; Bucky shrugs. &quot;And that meant arguing, clearly-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were lying in that hotel room,&quot; Steve says, flicking on the autopilot. &quot;And you're lying now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please.&quot; Bucky slides his gaze to the window and watches the raindrops scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are,&quot; Steve insists. He unlocks the bottom of the pilot's seat and swivels the chair around to face Bucky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I even need to lie to you?&quot; Bucky points out, something like a smile behind his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;You tell me.&quot; Steve smiles easily, crossing his legs. For all they've lost today, they still have this. &quot;You seemed pretty up in arms about it. And for the record.&quot; He pins his elbow on his knee and rests his head on his fist, &quot;I think you were right about me having a type.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bucky looks up. &quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
A moment passes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was I right about anything else?&quot; Bucky asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were right about a lot of things,&quot; Steve says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like not wanting to like people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bucky lets out a sharp breath through his nose. &quot;I was always right about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Always?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know how much I wanted to hate Carter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve frowns.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other one,&quot; Bucky elaborates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peggy?&quot; Steve's frown turns sad. &quot;You didn't like Peggy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I loved Peggy,&quot; Bucky insists. &quot;But you don't know how much I-&quot; He grits his teeth and his metal fingers recalibrate themselves. He takes a breath. &quot;You loved her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did.&quot; Steve nods. &quot;I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I always thought,&quot; Bucky said. &quot;If anyone. If anyone deserved you, if anyone got to have you, she'd... she'd be all right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Bucky Barnes seal of approval,&quot; Steve muses. &quot;That's pretty high praise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shaddup.&quot; Bucky leans back against the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad you liked her,&quot; Steve says. His hand balls into a fist as he keeps it from grabbing onto Bucky's shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't want to,&quot; Bucky says, slowly. &quot;But I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Clearly not understanding, Steve nods. &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don't,&quot; Bucky continues, &quot;I don't want to hate Carter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This Carter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This Carter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve tips his head to the side, questioningly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to hate Carter,&quot; Bucky repeats.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you do,&quot; Steve finishes.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I do,&quot; Bucky agrees. &quot;Not because she kicked me in the face.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve winces.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been kicked in the face before,&quot; Bucky adds. Steve's wince doubles.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't want to hate her?&quot; Steve prompts, carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like her,&quot; Bucky says, and shrugs. His metal arm scrapes against the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- respect her,&quot; Steve says.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like her,&quot; Bucky repeats.<br />
<br />
&quot;She spied on me for months in my own home,&quot; Steve points out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't- I just-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just?&quot; Bucky tears his eyes off the rain and looks into Steve's. &quot;You said that before. You just.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted to give her what she wanted,&quot; Steve says, helplessly. &quot;She's- she's Peggy's neice, she's helped me so much, she didn't have to, and she wanted- she wanted-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You,&quot; Bucky supplies.<br />
<br />
Steve sighs. &quot;I shouldn't have done it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not really the most pressing issue at hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't make it right. Small mistakes matter just as much as big ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, Mr. Inspirational Quotes.&quot; Bucky sits up. &quot;My point stands. You don't like blondes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve huffs. &quot;No,&quot; he says, &quot;I really, really don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;I knew it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The stubble on Bucky's face, Steve realizes, is almost a moustache. Bucky, he thinks, would look hideous with a moustache. The rest of the stubble suits him, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, am I boring you?&quot; Bucky says, and Steve realizes he's been staring.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he says, leaning back. &quot;No, no, not- no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So your type,&quot; Bucky prompts, amused. &quot;Your type, the type that I was apparently right about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Steve groans. &quot;You're never letting that go, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never,&quot; Bucky hums. &quot;So, tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you?&quot; Steve frowns. &quot;About what? There's nothing to tell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About your type.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You- you said my type already, I don't need to spell it back out for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I just want to hear you say it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? To torment me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I missed tormenting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that's what does it, really. Steve sighs, sinking an inch or so into the chair. It's a welcome distraction from the reality of what they're doing, anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are other things we could be talking about,&quot; he points out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to talk about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh.&quot; Steve rubs a hand over his face. &quot;Fine. What about my type?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a pattern. I'd say Tall, Dark, and Handsome, but Stark doesn't really fit the bill for the Tall part.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stark's not my type,&quot; Steve grumbles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, an anomaly.&quot; Bucky shrugs. &quot;So, Tall, Dark, and Handsome still stands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wilson?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is my sex life so important to every Russian spy I ever work with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One, I'm not Russian, and two, who said anything about your sex life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said type-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't say sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bucky, you can't just say-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one's here to hear it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't make it any less-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that your first kiss since 1945?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve's tongue grinds to a halt halfway through a word, and he gapes at Bucky. Bucky shrugs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just sayin'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Saying what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's not your type.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you get off that already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe. Maybe not. I like winding you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been wound up for a while, now, feel free to let go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is more fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For you, maybe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For me, definitely. This is the most fun I've had in years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Steve rolls his eyes. &quot;Rebuild your memory from scratch, remember me, and the first thing you do is rile me up about my inability to get girls. Figures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like old times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're unbelievable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you're still as dumb as you always were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that supposed to mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It means you've got a type.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bucky, are you seriously going to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bucky stands up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dark.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bucky tucks a lock of hair behind his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;And handsome.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve swallows back whatever words his brain was halfway through processing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; is all he manages.<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you so,&quot; Bucky says.<br />
<br />
Steve squares his shoulders and stands, too. &quot;I seem to remember that being something more like Tall, Annoying, Dark Hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, close enough,&quot; Bucky says, and kisses him.<br />
<br />
A few seconds, or perhaps minutes later, Steve realizes that they're standing up in a plane. He grabs Bucky around the waist and braces one hand against the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moving a little fast,&quot; Bucky says, &quot;aren't we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up,&quot; Steve mutters, and tightens his hold around Bucky's waist as the plane shudders.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long until we land?&quot; Bucky asks, nodding over Steve's shoulder. The trees below them have been turning steadily icier for the last half hour.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.&quot; Steve looks over his shoulder at the panal. &quot;Few more hours,&quot; he says, turning back. &quot;Four at the most.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Bucky says. &quot;Then we've got time.&quot;<br />
<br />
And soon, they'll be loading their weapons and standing at the edge of the doors. They'll head down that ramp and into the base and fight whoever comes out. Soon, they'll have to face the music.<br />
<br />
But right now, they've got time.<br />

<br />
When Lance walks onto the bridge, Keith is already in an argument with Shiro and Pidge.<br />
<br />
If he had the energy, he'd roll his eyes and join in on today's highlight reel of Keith's recklessness. But funnily enough, getting battered around by the Galra for two hours really drains a guy. He barely managed to change out of his armor.<br />
<br />
He trudges into the room, jacket dangling from his hands and dragging on the floor; he couldn't be bothered to put it on. But now he's wondering if he should've taken his time, because it looks like arguing is all they're going to do today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Black was fine!&quot; Keith exclaims. &quot;I did a systems check before I flew out, and our bond felt alright!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I'm telling you that she wasn't,&quot; Pidge stresses. &quot;There was a bug in her weapons array--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then explain the battleship I downed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; Shiro interjects, &quot;while it's great that you and Black functioned fine out there, you still couldn't have known it was safe for sure. You should've stayed in the castle--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like hell I'd sit on my ass--&quot;<br />
<br />
Pidge throws her hands up. &quot;Keith, you know we're not supposed to fly out on compromised systems. Even more so with Black, she's the head of Voltron--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's stronger than you think! It's not a big deal! The enemy was a complete idiot, I wasn't in any danger, it wasn't like her life support system or flight mechanisms were compromised--&quot;<br />
<br />
The argument spirals from there.<br />
<br />
Don't get him wrong, Keith's great as leader, but he's still learning. Sometimes, he regresses a little. And while Lance has never passed up a chance to rib his rival for a bit of fun--right now, he feels like going to sleep right here on the floor. Just watching this soap opera is draining what's left of his energy. When are they going to start the debrief? He wants to take a bubble bath, with the candles and the bath bomb he picked up at the space mall last month. He's filthy and sore all the way to his bone marrow, to his freaking organs.<br />
<br />
Pidge throws her datapad at Keith. He tries to suffocate her with his jacket. Shiro tries and fails to pry them apart.<br />
<br />
Lance looks around. Hunk's standing on the side, wringing his hands. Allura's straight-up ignoring them, and Coran's taking notes on his datapad. The subject line reads, 'Human Conflict Resolution.' There's a lot of red marks.<br />
<br />
Shit, why's it always got to be Lance?<br />
<br />
He shuffles over, intending to lend Shiro a hand, maybe lift Pidge off the ground and carry her away or something while Shiro deals with Keith.<br />
<br />
But what actually happens is that Lance, yawning, trips and falls right onto someone's back. His temple knocks against a warm ear and his hands latch onto firm, bare biceps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he says automatically. &quot;Didn't mean to bump into you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He almost thinks his hearing went out, too, when nothing but silence registers. He lifts his head, sluggish, and finds the entire room staring at him. He frowns and tries to get his feet under him--who's back is this anyw--<br />
<br />
Black, unruly hair tickles Lance's nose. Red armor fills his vision.<br />
<br />
Keith. He's leaning on Keith.<br />
<br />
Lance is draped all over Keith Kogane's fucking back like a fucking koala.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, dude,&quot; he begins, &quot;sorry, I should've watched where I was going, I--don't kill me, alright--&quot;<br />
<br />
Only, Keith doesn't react. He doesn't move a single muscle; it's like he's carved out of rock. Lance trails off, confused. He glances at Pidge and Shiro. They stare back, wide-eyed.<br />
<br />
Slowly, because he's kind of scared of what he'll see, Lance leans around to catch a look at Keith's face.<br />
<br />
Blank, placid eyes. Jaw slack and brows smoothed out.<br />
<br />
Lance waves a hand in front of his face. Nothing, not a twitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell,&quot; he whispers. &quot;Shiro?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No idea,&quot; Shiro replies, bewildered.<br />
<br />
Lance hesitantly pokes Keith's cheek. &quot;Dude, you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You broke him,&quot; Pidge accuses.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did not! I just fell on him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shiro eyes them. &quot;Lance, could you...could you move away?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure.&quot; He detaches himself from Keith.<br />
<br />
The moment he does, Keith boots up like a fucking robot. You can actually see the life flicker back into his eyes. Dude just goes straight back to hissing at Shiro.<br />
<br />
&quot;--and another thing,&quot; he begins, &quot;you never listened to Iverson when he said to sit out--&quot;<br />
<br />
Shiro takes Lance's hands and slaps them against Keith's arms. Keith immediately shuts up and goes back to impersonating a wax figure.<br />
<br />
An unholy grin stretches over Shiro's face. &quot;Oh, I get it now.&quot; He chuckles, low. &quot;Oh, this is too good. This is gold, oh hoho ho, I am a rich bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Lance asks. He tries to take his hands back but Shiro forces them to hold Keith's. What the hell. &quot;Shiro, what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Beside him, Pidge gasps. &quot;You're his off button.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance just looks at her and laughs. It sounds so ridiculous. That's--there's no way that's true. Him? Having that type of effect on Keith? That's not a thing, that doesn't happen to people.<br />
<br />
His laughter peters off as he glances at Keith, standing docile before him. Curiosity wells up in him. He lets go.<br />
<br />
Keith blinks, rapid. His head jerks up and his mouth opens.<br />
<br />
Lance locks their hands together and--yup. Yeah, that's--wow, huh. Keith's eyes have glazed over again, and he slumps against Lance like his muscles have all atrophied. Okay, so this is a thing. A thing that is happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you,&quot; says Pidge.<br />
<br />
Lance sighs. &quot;Let's just debrief already. I need a five-hour nap before I can even think of dealing with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After the meeting, Lance drops Keith off at his quarters, paying no mind to Keith's confusion and the questions aimed at his back. He just drops into bed and passes the fuck out.<br />
<br />
Yeah, not dealing with the Keith thing at all.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The next morning, they're asked to weigh in on a dispute brought up by a Coalition member or something. Boring bureaucratic shit. You'd think saving the world involved less bullshit.<br />
<br />
This leaves no time for the team to poke fun at Keith for whatever that was yesterday, which Shiro looks disproportionately disappointed by. Honestly, Lance would prefer if it never came up again. He has no idea how to feel about it. He and Keith might be friends now, but he draws the line at explaining to the guy that he's got a Lance-shaped weakness. That's just bound to go over badly.<br />
<br />
At least Keith doesn't look like he has any idea what happened. Small mercies.<br />
<br />
The day progresses and not much gets resolved. More issues crop up, actually. Shiro looks a hair's breadth away from politely committing murder. His customer service smile is decidedly manic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like we said,&quot; he grits out, &quot;Voltron can't be in two places at once. We can't respond to your hails every time. That's why we stationed Captain Kli-f's battalion on your planet--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not enough!&quot; The alien shakes their head, blubbering. Lance finds that this species is really susceptible to emotional breakdowns. &quot;The Galra almost annihilated us yesterday!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance bites his lip. Now, that's a blatant lie. Their distress call turned out to be about space debris. Fuck, he would find this hilarious if he wasn't so sick of being stuck in this room. It's been five hours.<br />
<br />
As if on cue, the seat beside him is shoved back. Keith stands, scowling. Ohh, he's mad. Here we go.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is fucking stupid,&quot; he states.<br />
<br />
Lance ducks his head, hiding a grin in his palm.<br />
<br />
Allura sighs. &quot;Keith--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Princess, let me just--&quot; He turns to the alien, who quivers before his glare. &quot;You. You--we have things we need to do, why are we still here? You're safe, you don't need anything else!&quot;<br />
<br />
The alien makes a valiant effort to refute him. Really, it's commendable; Keith's pretty scary, after all. &quot;But we're in close proximity to a Galra settlement--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You decided to build your settlement there!&quot; Keith hollers. &quot;This was your choice, you--listen. You're getting Captain Kli-f and her soldiers, that's it, and you're going to be happy about it, or so help me, god, I will--&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance spots movement at the edges of his vision--soldiers reaching for their weapons. Shiro is rising to his feet. Coran has his hands out, placating the rest of the council. The team seems resigned to another meeting ending in a Keith-typical way.<br />
<br />
Ah, seriously, Lance really wishes he could've forgotten about the whole issue.<br />
<br />
With a heavy sigh, he stands. As heads turn to him, he slips off his suit glove and places his hand on Keith's nape. The noise level abruptly cuts in half as Keith's mouth snaps shut. The soldiers pause and the crying alien--what is their name?--stops, well, stops fucking crying, thank god.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Lance says, &quot;I'm just going to borrow him for a moment. We'll be right back.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he steers them towards the doors, Shiro gives him an embarrassingly proud thumbs-up. Lance wants to die. He's got Keith by the fucking neck like a misbehaving cat; what about this deserves a thumbs-up?<br />
<br />
The attendants milling about give him directions to the nearest empty room. He tugs Keith into it and locks the door. God, he hates everything about this situation. He pushes Keith into a chair.<br />
<br />
He exhales steadily, then removes his hand.<br />
<br />
Keith blinks woodenly. Lance sees the moment his eyes focus in on Lance's chestplate. His head lifts, and he stares dumbly at Lance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, man,&quot; says Lance. &quot;You good?&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith takes in their surroundings. &quot;What--where are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance drops into the seat next to him. &quot;So, we forgot to tell you about something yesterday. Don't freak out, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suspicion falls over Keith's features. &quot;What's wrong? Where is everyone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you gotta promise you won't get mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you serious?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance just looks at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who am I kidding, of course you are. Fine.&quot; Keith puts a hand over his heart. &quot;I promise I won't get mad. Now, spit it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance purses his lips, swiveling side to side in his chair. There's no easy way to explain this. He's just going to have to go for it. &quot;You--when I touch you, you--shut off? Sort of? You were getting really mad back there, so I, um. I thought you could maybe chill a little so I touched you--honestly I wasn't expecting it to work--but you shut off, again, and now we're here. Just to--just to cool off for bit, but mostly because I'm taking this chance to get the fuck out of that room.&quot;<br />
<br />
A beat, then Keith scowls. &quot;If this is a joke--&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance smacks his arm. &quot;Dude, I wouldn't mess with you like that. A mean prank like that would involve, like, heavy drugs, man, what the fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith squints at him. &quot;...Okay, fine. Right. But--shutting off? What, like a phone? You do know that sounds ridiculous, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, it looks even weirder than it sounds. Yesterday, you--I fell on you and you stopped talking and everything. Wouldn't respond to anything. Kinda creepy, to be honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lingering traces of doubt pulls Keith's lips into a tight line. Lance doesn't blame him; if he hadn't seen it first-hand, he'd be hard-pressed to believe it, too. Still kind of feels like he's going to wake up in his own bed and this was all just a dumb dream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, here, let me just--&quot; He reaches out, fingers inches from Keith's cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;What--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just--don't hit me, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
He brushes his fingertips over the swell of Keith's cheekbones.<br />
<br />
He's expecting him to freeze, go all ragdoll-like. He expects a deactivated Keith-bot.<br />
<br />
What he gets is a--a sigh, and Keith's lashes fucking--fluttering.<br />
<br />
Lance inhales sharply. Okay, fuck, what? That's new?<br />
<br />
That familiar glassiness has slid over Keith's features, but he leans into the touch like a cat, mindless and shameless. Lance lets him, too stunned to stop it. This is--different. This--Keith's reacting, this time. He's still zoning out, still pliant to Lance's direction, but he's seeking it out, too. When Lance eases off, he pushes in.<br />
<br />
&quot;The hell?&quot; he mutters. What's different about this time?<br />
<br />
Keith just hums and leans so far towards Lance that he nearly tips out of his seat. With a flush, Lance realizes he's been stroking Keith's face. He rips his hand away and jams the traitorous thing under his thighs.<br />
<br />
Keith comes back quicker this time. He doesn't look confused about his surroundings. Is--is he getting used to whatever this is? Is he retaining consciousness now?<br />
<br />
He stares at Lance for a long second, then a slow spread of pink climbs up his neck. Well, shit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; he croaks. &quot;So that--that happened yesterday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Except you, uh, you didn't remember it--but you did this time?&quot; Lance peeks at him.<br />
<br />
Keith gives a jerky nod.<br />
<br />
Silence falls over them.<br />
<br />
Lance jiggles his leg. Great, this is--great, yup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that happen with the others, too?&quot; Keith asks.<br />
<br />
Lance stills, then starts fidgeting faster. &quot;Um, not that I know of?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, it's just with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
He blows out a breath. &quot;Dude, I've no clue. Shouldn't I be asking you about this? Hasn't this happened to you before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, of course not! If I knew I'd check out when someone touched me, we wouldn't be here right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smile pulls at Lance's lips. &quot;Ah, that's right, you'd probably be suited up, head to toe, in a homemade anti-touch suit or something. Oh god, now I'm imagining preteen you decked out in hockey gear, just to avoid this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith kicks him. Lance kicks him back.<br />
<br />
He pauses. &quot;Wait, that didn't do anything for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't say it like that,&quot; Keith grumbles. He scrutinizes his leg. &quot;No, don't think so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance hums. So, there's parameters to this touch thing. Skin to skin, uh, obviously works. But it looks like a thin layer is enough to block it.<br />
<br />
But he distinctly remembers sparring with Keith, in tees with plenty of skin bared. Their scuffles never resulted in this. And Keith's probably gotten minor skin contact with others at some point, so why now? Why's his body acting up all of a sudden?<br />
<br />
...Oh my god.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; he says, horrified, &quot;are you like, hitting Galra puberty or something? Is this a side-effect?&quot;<br />
<br />
A beat.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Keith shoots to his feet. &quot;You--that's gross, what--why would you even say that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, it makes sense!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely not. No, there's got to be another explanation for this. Maybe I got hit by spores or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, we're going to have to call Kolivan.&quot; Lance makes a face. &quot;Wonder what his reaction's gonna be to being asked if puberty for Galra involves being--petted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up,&quot; Keith demands. &quot;I do not like being petted and I am not going through puberty a second time!&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice--his voice fucking cracks.<br />
<br />
The worst part about it, is that it clearly does not crack like a human voice--it cracks into a growl. Like the sound a large cat would make.<br />
<br />
Lance literally could not tell you how long they spend staring at each other in terror. He opens his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't,&quot; says Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just growled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith closes his eyes.<br />
<br />
Lance slides down in his seat. Ohhh shit, they are not prepared for this, oh god, they are so not prepared for this. He was not expecting to be right--that was half a joke! What's next? Fangs?<br />
<br />
Okay, but that's hot--no, shut up.<br />
<br />
Not for the first time, Lance wishes fate would cut them a break. Isn't fighting a war enough? Now they have to deal with this shit? And he knows he's going to be involved in this process, because that's the fine print to being the right-hand man; his leader's bullshit is his bullshit, now. Fuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not going back to the meeting,&quot; Keith states.<br />
<br />
Lance considers that. Considers ignoring that, considers dragging Keith into a situation that had already irritated him so badly that Lance had to touch-whammy him just to calm him down. Shit, with the growling thing--what if the next time he pops off, he manifests a mouth full of steak knives?<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going back to the meeting,&quot; Lance agrees.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They call Kolivan.<br />
<br />
&quot;This doesn't mean I think you're right,&quot; Keith assures him. &quot;We're just ruling out possibilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance keeps quiet and lets him have his delusions. Of the two of them, Lance has got the longest winning streak of being right.<br />
<br />
Kolivan, as always, greets them with all the enthusiasm of a rotting fungus. &quot;What is it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance waits for Keith to say something. When he doesn't, opting instead to stare at the Blade leader in sudden mortification, Lance asks for him: &quot;What can you tell us about Galra biology? We think Keith's going through a--developmental patch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing visibly changes in Kolivan's expression, but Lance gets the impression that the man would rather be dipping his eyeballs in acid than answer this.<br />
<br />
&quot;A developmental patch,&quot; he says. Shit, what is he, a parrot?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; says Lance, because Keith's still mute. &quot;When he receives skin-to-skin contact, he zones out. Like, he's awake, but he's just completely unresponsive.&quot; He pauses. And because he's kind of a jerk, he adds, &quot;Do you want a demonstration?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No fucking way, Lance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simultaneous appalled replies from both Kolivan and Keith. Lance feels proud.<br />
<br />
&quot;That will not be necessary,&quot; Kolivan says. &quot;I believe I know what you're referring to. Keith, were you isolated as a child? Or did you perhaps receive significantly less physical contact than your peers at any point in your adolescence?&quot;<br />
<br />
Whoa, hit the guy a little harder right where it hurts, why don't you?<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yes,&quot; Keith mutters. &quot;Why.&quot;<br />
<br />
Great, now Kolivan's got him doing the same dead-tone shit. Lance is going to refuse Keith's Blade missions on his behalf if this keeps happening.<br />
<br />
What? The team worked hard to get Keith to this level of sociability. Lance's not about to let their efforts go to waste.<br />
<br />
&quot;Galra are the most tactile when young,&quot; Kolivan begins. &quot;Our mental and physical health depends heavily on positive touch, with peers and parental figures. If a Galra child experiences isolation from such necessities, they may develop a condition later in life--an extreme sensitivity to touch. In some cases, it can be debilitating. 'Zoning out,' as you describe it, is a common symptom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith looks at Lance. Lance looks back.<br />
<br />
Okay. Okay, alright. Cool, okay, chill, fine. That's fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are the other symptoms?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Delayed physical maturity,&quot; Kolivan says bluntly.<br />
<br />
Lance slams his hands on his thighs. &quot;Called it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!&quot; Keith roars. Like, literally. That was a roar, that was a sound produced by Galra vocal chords, right there. Keith instantly drops his head into his hands, whining low and pained. Still sounding like a cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vocal changes,&quot; Kolivan observes. &quot;Yes, I do believe you are undergoing puberty, paladin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to die,&quot; Keith whispers.<br />
<br />
Lance pats his hand, forgetting what effect that has until Keith sways on the spot, then he snatches his hand away, face blazing. Kolivan is politely pretending he didn't witness that. Keith gives up and squats on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I deal with this,&quot; he croaks.<br />
<br />
Now Kolivan looks even more anguished, meaning his brows visibly pull together. &quot;...Touch, mostly,&quot; he finally says. &quot;You need to acclimatize to physical sensation from others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance raises a hand. &quot;Wait, that doesn't make sense. When--okay, so the first time it happened, it was because I tripped and fell on his back. But right before that, he had Pidge in a head-lock, and this morning, he slapped Shiro's hand away from his plate. He was fine both times.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You're saying he only has a reaction to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lance flounders. &quot;I--guess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; says Kolivan, looking not at all interested. &quot;Unfortunately, I have no explanation for that. Perhaps it is a result of his human genes. In any case, all he needs to do is adapt to whatever stimuli causes him to 'zone out.' If that's stimuli from you, then it's stimuli from you. It's not complicated. Now, if that is all, paladins, I must be going. I have a base to destroy in the next minute. Kolivan out.&quot;<br />
<br />
The screen goes black.<br />
<br />
&quot;That went well,&quot; Lance offers.<br />
<br />
Keith slaps his shin.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, that's the situation, basically. He's touch-starved and just needs some love.&quot; Lance looks around at the team gathered in the lounge. Keith's standing beside him, miserable. &quot;Any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
Coran is teary-eyed. So is Shiro. Hunk's just full-on sobbing; gotta love the guy.<br />
<br />
Shiro stands and pulls Keith into a hug so overdone that Keith's feet lift off the floor. &quot;Keith, I am so sorry--Adam and I should've noticed you weren't getting enough hugs! This is all our fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; Keith snorts. &quot;You guys did nothing but hug me. I'm pretty sure this is because of that time in orphanage, actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shiro squeezes him harder. Keith kicks at his kneecaps, completely ineffective against his brick shithouse of a brother. &quot;I'm going to smother you in hugs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too!&quot; adds Hunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;We all will!&quot; Coran joins in. Allura nods, scarily determined. Pidge shrugs.<br />
<br />
Lance is perfectly content to let them think there's no bias here, except Keith, the dumbass, has to go and be honest about who he actually needs hugs from. &quot;Thanks, but it's only really Lance that can help. He makes me zone out, so he needs to touch me enough that I eventually stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone freezes. Keith slowly reddens as he registers what he said, and how he said it. Lance mentally writes a note, reminding himself to murder Keith in his sleep tonight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; says Shiro, glancing between them. &quot;Oh, okay. Unrelated, but is there anything you two want to tell me--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I'm heading out,&quot; Lance says. &quot;Good talk, everybody.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you dare leave me here,&quot; threatens Keith. &quot;Lance, get back here. Lance! You asshole, are you seriously--if you walk through that door, I am going to slice up your wool blanket! Lance!&quot;<br />
<br />
Out in the hallway, Lance takes a moment to send a prayer up for Keith, then sets off for the kitchen. Hunk's bound to have a pie in the oven by this time of day.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's been four months since Keith took over as Black's paladin. Three months since they found Shiro strapped to a dissection table in one of Haggar's labs and blew the whole thing up, including the matter transporter she used to nab him.<br />
<br />
Four months since Lance and Keith have started up their co-leading thing.<br />
<br />
Over those months, Lance comes to terms with a few things.<br />
<br />
One, that he and Keith really do make a good team, more than the one time. Honestly, it makes the competitive sixteen-year-old Lance in his head fume. But he's older now, and supposedly more mature, so he pretends he can't hear it whining.<br />
<br />
Two, that while he misses piloting Blue every day, Red's great too. Sometimes, Red even gets jealous about having to share Lance with Blue, and Keith with Black, and it's lowkey adorable.<br />
<br />
Which leads him to three: that this co-leading role actually really fits him well. He wouldn't have chosen it for himself, but Red knew better. Blue knew better.<br />
<br />
He's always found it easy to guide people along, to ease tensions in groups, and encourage others. He thought that meant he was a leader. And, to an extent, he is. He can lead in a pinch; he'd like to think he could fit with any group who needed a temporary head.<br />
<br />
But there's a sort of pride that he gets from being Keith's second. At first, he refused to acknowledge it. What kind of rival would settle for being second-best? Wasn't he going to be better than Keith?<br />
<br />
But the satisfaction he gets when Keith leaves his back open for Lance to guard is too gratifying to ignore. The ease with which Keith listens to his suggestions and his confidence in Lance as a grounding rod for his fiery temper is vindicating, in a strange way. And the moments where Keith seeks him out to confess worries or uncertainties is always a--pleasant surprise. Because he'd have thought, now with Shiro back, that Keith would stop going to him.<br />
<br />
So, it's less about being second-best, and more about being the safety net, the complement. The mediator, the unwavering pillar. He finds a different sort of strength in this, one he never saw coming, but one that feels just as good.<br />
<br />
And now they're here, in a ridiculous predicament, with Keith needing something so personal from him. Lance is well-aware that, a mere four months ago, neither of them would've been able to stomach this. Keith would've locked himself in his room rather than let himself be vulnerable in front of Lance. And Lance--he would've eventually done his part, sure--but not without complaining to hell and back, hating every second of it.<br />
<br />
Now, it's better. Now, they're co-leaders of Voltron. They've dealt with worse things than a little forced physical contact.<br />
<br />
Though, he won't lie, it's still a little embarrassing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keith, it defeats the purpose if you stand all the way over there,&quot; he says tiredly. &quot;Could you, like, sit down?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; replies Keith, halfway across the lounge. &quot;I will. Give me a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance does. Lance gives him multiple seconds. Lance gives him so many seconds that he might as well be a seconds billionaire at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't make me come over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith grumbles, but sinks down next to him. &quot;Alright, do your worst.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is just sad. Who reacts to impending physical affection with 'do your worst?' What does he think Lance is going to do--wrap all four limbs around him and suffocate him? This is too sad to think about, he's just going to go for it.<br />
<br />
He starts off small and wraps a hand around Keith's wrist.<br />
<br />
Keith fucking flops over onto his lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; he says. &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nrghgh,&quot; says Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so you can respond, now. Sort of. That's good. Progress, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hesitantly, Lance strokes Keith's hair, the pressure so light he might as well be touching the air above Keith's head.<br />
<br />
Keith still fucking--shudders.<br />
<br />
Lance cranes his head back and glares at the ceiling. His ears are burning. Why him. Why--fucking--this is so unfair.<br />
<br />
Keith is a dead weight across his thighs. He runs reluctant fingers through Keith's hair.<br />
<br />
At some point, his fingers decide to go about detangling the knots they find. Lance blinks down at the glossy, wavy strands and feels betrayed, somehow.<br />
<br />
He clears his throat. &quot;Hey, Keith? How long am I supposed to do this for?&quot; He lifts his hands.<br />
<br />
Keith growls.<br />
<br />
He places his hands back. Okay, so, for longer than that. Fine. He can manage that, whatever.<br />
<br />
He decides to make a braid. If he's being held hostage, he's going to take his amusement where he can. Keith will just have to deal.<br />
<br />
He's on his fourth braid when Keith jerks out of his hold.<br />
<br />
Lance meets his gaze, blinking, hands still poised above his lap. Three and a half braids stick out of Keith's head, and there's a red pillow mark--jeans mark?--on his face. A flush has settled over the top of his cheeks and the bridge of his nose. He's got a deer-in-the-headlights face on.<br />
<br />
Cute, thinks Lance. Then, fuck, no, shut up. Not dealing with this, remember?<br />
<br />
&quot;I got to go,&quot; Keith blurts, shooting to his feet. &quot;Bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he runs out the door, he has the decency to throw a strangled, &quot;thanks,&quot; over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Lance is left staring after him, struggling not to feel like he's just been ditched on an awkward date.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Another great thing about this partnership they have--they're on the same wavelength more often than not, nowadays. Meaning they wordlessly agree not to acknowledge the touch thing unless they really need to.<br />
<br />
Days pass and everything is routine. Lance gets that satisfied feeling in his chest when he sees that any awkwardness they might be feeling has no bearing on their duties. They still kick ass on the field. That's professionalism, baby.<br />
<br />
Keith doesn't approach him for--that--for about a week. And it's fine, he doesn't seem to be suffering ill effects. Sure, his voice cracks more so he doesn't speak much, which means he's even more of a silent brooding presence now. And when he does speak, it's a lot deeper than Lance expects. It's fine. Whatever. It doesn't keep him up at night, it doesn't.<br />
<br />
...And is it just Lance or are Keith's pupils weirdly slitted now, too? And yesterday, Keith tore into his Ruvili steak without a knife. Just his teeth. Steak juice slid down his chin and Lance had to excuse himself to use the bathroom.<br />
<br />
He didn't actually use it. He just crouched by the dining room doors and thought about Slav's mustache until his half-boner went away.<br />
<br />
So, a week and a half later and Keith is significantly...sharper? More cat-like? More animalistic? Hotter?<br />
<br />
Anyway, with how he is, they should've predicted that such developments would upset people.<br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot fathom why you would let the enemy command Voltron,&quot; some half-baked alien declares to Lance at a banquet. &quot;His fangs are unsightly, his eyes even more so!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance calmly sets his fork down. &quot;Man, I really wish you hadn't said that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would not do be dishonest!&quot; the alien exclaims, and like, shit, is there a single alien race out there that doesn't have some annoying mannerism?<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; He wipes his mouth with the napkin. &quot;My turn, then. You have the all the charm and personality of a decaying sack of entrails on a hot summer day.&quot;<br />
<br />
The alien's mouth drops open. &quot;I beg your pardon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The scent of your breath is enough to castrate a weblum. If Zarkon ever met you on the battlefield, he would run from the sight of your shadow on the dirt, let alone you yourself. You probably ate your siblings in the womb and liked it. Even maggots wouldn't eat your flesh--&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance goes on like this for quite a while.<br />
<br />
By the time the team and the alien king hosting them are aware of the situation, Lance is helping himself to another slice of cake and the idiot that insulted Keith is on the floor crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?&quot; Hunk asks, baffled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing. All I did was respond in kind when he cast insults.&quot; Lance raises a brow at the alien king. &quot;That's the correct social procedure for your people, isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance knows he's right. He read Coran's briefing, front to back, three times. It clearly states that if someone receives an insult, they're allowed--they're owed, in fact--the right to shoot back with as much vitriol as they believe they suffered.<br />
<br />
The king is staring at his subject in abject horror. Good, so he gets how badly that idiot insulted a Voltron paladin. &quot;I--yes. Yes, that is correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I crave your pardon,&quot; wails the alien on the floor. &quot;I did not mean to invoke your anger! I crave your pardon! Please, retract your poisonous words!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They...they must have gravely offended you,&quot; the king says haltingly. &quot;On their behalf, I apologize. I will have them reprimanded.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance shrugs. &quot;It's fine, I think I took care of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all regard the weeping alien silently. The king's guards wordlessly shuffle closer to their monarch. Lance wants to tell them to relax. He's not going to try anything. Not unless the king pulls the same shit with him.<br />
<br />
Pidge snaps a picture of the scene and goes back to her seat. Hunk claps Lance on the shoulder and follows her. Coran, after confirming that Lance did not actually commit a social faux-pas, just nods approvingly and tows a gob-smacked Shiro and a long-suffering Allura back to the head of the table.<br />
<br />
Only Keith remains. He's got those piercing violet eyes fixed on Lance's face and yeah, his pupils are definitely slitted.<br />
<br />
Lance waits, but Keith doesn't say anything. Just stands there, expression intent, as security comes to collect the distraught alien. He doesn't blink once. Lance can't read his expression at all.<br />
<br />
Lance breaks first. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They really offended you?&quot; Keith asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I would've caused a scene over nothing?&quot; Lance snorts. &quot;Have some faith in me, dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith cocks his head. Something about it raises the hairs on Lance's nape. &quot;Just curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance spends the rest of the dinner feeling just a bit off-kilter and not knowing why.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Later, he finds out that Keith's hearing has extended twice over, when Hunk mumbles something half a football field away and Keith answers him. Fucking--seriously?<br />
<br />
He refuses to acknowledge Keith's existence (or the sly glance he shoots Lance's way) for the rest of the day.<br />
<br />
Not dealing with it. Nope, no sir.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Three days after Lance verbally reduces a grown person to tears, they finally get another touch session. Albeit, an unexpected one.<br />
<br />
He and Keith are on an intel-gathering mission. Easy stuff. The most surprising thing that happens is that Keith manages to confuse a couple Galra soldiers to a stop by flashing his fangs and snarling at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's half-Galra?!&quot; One of them squeaks. His chompers are noticeably duller, Lance observes.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's dead is what he is,&quot; another sneers, typically villainous. The safety on their blaster is on. Idiot.<br />
<br />
The third soldier has their ears pulled back, yellow eyes wide and skittering all over the place. When Keith growls, they whimper.<br />
<br />
Lance kind of feels bad for all of them. For like a ghost of half of a second, maybe.<br />
<br />
Suffice to say, he and Keith apprehend this group rather easily. Keith's super-hearing is badass to see in action. It's like he's got eyes at the</td>

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
The apartment they have moved into is small, with only one actual bedroom and bathroom to squeeze four kids and one adult into (Touya and Fuyumi help their mom partition out the bedroom by hanging up sheets, and Touya takes the couch so his mom and Shouto can have one side of the bedroom, and Fuyumi and Natsu the other). It's also not in the best of neighborhoods, with trash littering the streets, and sketchy people standing in the corners, and their mom won't let them go out at night at all, but Touya still likes it better than their old mansion.<br />
<br />
Here, even if their mother is out late for her new job at a magazine, they can laugh without worrying about what mood their father is in, there isn't a constant sense of dread and bated breath only punctuated by fire and screams, and Touya doesn't have to worry about once again being hauled into the training room until his skin is nearly blistering off and he is vomiting while his father is screaming at him to stop being such a weakling and get up.<br />
<br />
(Is he bitter that it's only when their father started pulling Shouto into the training room as well that their mother finally decided that enough was enough and took them all away?<br />
<br />
Well--Shouto has always been the chosen child from his birth, and it's not like being the favorite has given him much joy, and really the kid is only four, but--<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's good for now that their mother is so busy at her new job.)<br />
<br />
Still, it is a bit harder than life used to be. Their mom gets up early to make breakfast and get all the kids awake, but she has to leave quickly, and they don't have maids or nannies anymore, so Touya is in charge of making sure all his siblings have all their stuff before leaving for school. When they come home, Touya is in charge of dinner (he's gotten pretty proficient at using the rice cooker, and the instructions on the miso soup pack and the curry packs aren't too hard to follow. Fuyumi has also gotten the hang of eggs, so between the two of them, they can usually set out a pretty decent, if somewhat repetitive spread), throwing any dirty clothes into the washing machine, corralling his siblings to do their homework while also doing his own, and then getting them to wash up and sleep at night.<br />
<br />
With all that going on, Touya doesn't feel guilty about staying up a bit later at night, sitting out on the balcony to not bother his siblings, and playing the records he had managed to grab as their mother was hurrying them out of the Todoroki mansion.<br />
<br />
Usually he tries to keep the volume low, but given the music blaring around them from the alleyway, and after a particularly trying day spent trying to track down Natsuo's lost volleyball and Shouto's misplaced hat, he cranks up the music and lets the crash of the cymbals and drums wash over him.<br />
<br />
It's about three songs in that he notices a small blonde head peeping out at him from the balcony next to theirs. It's dark, so it's hard to tell, but it looks like a small blonde boy, maybe a little younger than himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi?&quot; Touya calls out.<br />
<br />
The boy's head disappears behind the balcony wall.<br />
<br />
(Maybe the kid's shy?)<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Touya tries again, walking over to the balcony railing, &quot;I definitely know you're there.&quot;<br />
<br />
No response.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may as well come out now,&quot; Touya continues looking over the railing, &quot;Unless--am I bothering you? I can turn it off if you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; a small voice carries out from over the balcony, &quot;Could--could you leave it on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Touya agrees, peering into the darkness, &quot;But can you stop hiding?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy slowly stands up, clutching some kind of doll, and--were those wings?<br />
<br />
&quot;Can--can you fly?&quot; Touya asks, gesturing at his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Sort of,&quot; the boy says quietly, his small wings flapping around him, &quot;I'm not really--supposed to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you fly over here?&quot; Touya asks, pointing at his own balcony.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could--try?&quot; the boy says, clutching his doll tighter to himself, &quot;But--I'm not supposed to--go out at night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's literally a few feet,&quot; Touya says reasonably, &quot;It doesn't really count as going out at night, does it? And--if your parents look outside, I think they'll still be able to see you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy bites his lip, &quot;I don't know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can pick what music to play if you fly over here?&quot; Touya suggests, holding up his CD's, &quot;It's too dark for you to see what they are from over there, isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
(Why is he trying so hard to get the other boy to come over here?<br />
<br />
Maybe--maybe it's because he doesn't really have other friends at the new school he was transferred to, what with the Todoroki divorce being splashed across all the airwaves and him having to come straight home from school to take care of his other siblings.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's because he'd like to hang out with another kid who isn't one of his siblings who he occasionally fantasizes about just locking out of the apartment.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's also because--the way that boy is holding himself, scared and nervous, shrinking in to try and make himself smaller--it's intimately familiar.)<br />
<br />
The boy perks up a bit, looking intently at the CD's in Touya's hand, &quot;...okay,&quot; he says, his wings flaring out.<br />
<br />
He flaps his wings a few times to get higher and then flies and daintily lands next to Touya, tucking his wings back in (and closer to the light, Touya can see that they are as red as his own hair, and he just barely manages to hold himself back from reaching out and touching them), and still clutching the doll, that now on closer inspection, Touya can tell is an Endeavor action figure.<br />
<br />
(It shouldn't be a surprise; after all, in exchange for gaining custody of all of her children, their mother had not filed any charges against their father, so Endeavor's reputation is still pristine, and instead it just looks like their mother suddenly snapped and decided to divorce him.<br />
<br />
Still, this kid knows nothing about any of that, and even if Touya wishes that it was one of those ubiquitous All Might dolls that their mother had bought Shouto, and it's not necessarily a bad thing.<br />
<br />
He'll just keep his last name a secret for now.)<br />
<br />
Touya smiles at the boy, offering him the CD's, &quot;Hi, I'm Touya.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; the boy parrots back, carefully taking the CD's from Touya's hand and looking down at the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not supposed to tell strangers,&quot; the boy says, gently placing his Endeavor action figure on the ground.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Well, I have to call you something,&quot; Touya says, searching for cool bird names, &quot;...how about...Raven? No, your wings are red. Robin? Falcon? Hawks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hawks sounds cool,&quot; the boy says, looking up shyly and holding up the brightly colored k-pop CD that Touya had accidentally picked up from Fuyumi's collection when he had been frantically packing stuff up as they were leaving the mansion.<br />
<br />
It's--definitely not his kind of music, but--it would be really mean to let the kid down after he had put in so much effort to convince to come over in the first place, so Touya pops out his X Japan CD in favor of the BlackPink one, and the peppy music starts tinnily playing around them.<br />
<br />
&quot;It--doesn't sound much like what you were playing before,&quot; Hawks says, nervously looking over at Touya, &quot;If you want to switch it back--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like it?&quot; Touya asks.<br />
<br />
Hawks hesitates and then nods, &quot;Yes, but--if you don't--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the guest, so you can pick whatever you want,&quot; Touya says stoutly, sitting down on the foldable chair and gesturing at the other one for Hawks to take.<br />
<br />
Hawks slowly sits down, picking up his Endeavor action figure to set on his knees, &quot;...thank you,&quot; he says softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the one keeping me company,&quot; Touya points out, &quot;Also--I guess we haven't been good neighbors; we've never greeted you or anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay, it's not really--that kind of neighborhood,&quot; Hawks says, looking inside at Touya's living room, with the blankets tossed across the couch, papers scattered around, and toys underfoot, &quot;You--have a lot of siblings?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Three,&quot; Touya replies, &quot;I know the walls are thin--are we bothering you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it's--nice,&quot; Hawks says hesitantly, &quot;I don't--have any siblings, so--it's kind of nice to hear you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you're welcome to borrow any of them,&quot; Touya jokes, leaning back, &quot;I suggest Natsu if you want someone to play sports with; you picked Fuyumi's CD though, so you might get along with her too. And Shouto's just a baby, so he's no fun. Just make sure to bring them back before mom comes home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I--can I hang out with you more?&quot; Hawks asks, biting his lip and looking up at Touya.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?&quot; Touya asks, staring at Hawks.<br />
<br />
(He's--<br />
<br />
In their family, Fuyumi is the only girl, Natsu is the most athletic, and Shouto was the chosen one, which left Touya to be the failure and the cast-off.<br />
<br />
No one's ever picked him first before.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Hawks nods, his wings curling around him, &quot;You seem--really cool, and--I mean if I'm bothering you, we don't have to--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not bothering me,&quot; Touya cuts in, &quot;And--yeah, you can definitely hang out with me, any time!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks smiles shyly at Touya, his wings unfurling around him, &quot;Oh--that's great! Um--what school do you go to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shizuoka Middle School.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks goggles at Touya, &quot;Wait--you're a middle schooler? I thought--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know, I'm scrawny,&quot; Touya snaps, crossing his arms defensively, &quot;One of these days I'll hit a growth spurt though.&quot;<br />
<br />
(Hopefully.<br />
<br />
It's pretty embarrassing being shorter than his little brother who is four years younger than him, and he's only barely taller than Fuyumi, and if she gets a growth spurt first, Natsu will never let him hear the end of it.)<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean--I'm sure you will,&quot; Hawks says reassuringly, shifting in his seat, &quot;I just thought--I mean, I know you're not in my class, but I thought that maybe if we were in the same school...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you go?&quot; Touya asks, uncrossing his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Waseda Elementary. It's--not that great,&quot; Hawks admits, drawing himself in.<br />
<br />
Touya snorts, &quot;My school isn't that great either, but then again, it doesn't have to be. I'm just keeping my grades up and waiting until I can apply to Shiketsu anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shiketsu?&quot; Hawks asks, looking at him, &quot;So--you want to be a hero? Why not U.A. then?&quot;<br />
<br />
(Because Endeavor went to U.A., and like hell does Touya want to follow his old man's footsteps there.<br />
<br />
He'll go to Shiketsu and become a pro-hero on his own terms and rub it in his old man's face that his cast-off failure had managed to do so well despite him.)<br />
<br />
&quot;U.A. is a little overrated, isn't it?&quot; Touya says instead, scratching the back of his head, &quot;And--I mean kind of? I'd like to, but my quirk is a bit--temperamental.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's your quirk?&quot; Hawks asks, leaning forward.<br />
<br />
Touya holds out a hand and lets his blue flames lick over his fingers and the palm of his hand before quickly snuffing them out, shaking his hand a bit, fingers stinging.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's so cool!&quot; Hawks exclaims, eyes shining, &quot;You're like Endeavor, except you have blue fire! Is it just a color thing, or is it actually hotter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's hotter,&quot; Touya says, opening and closing his fist to chase away the burning sensation, &quot;But--I'm not--exactly fire-proof. My body--I think the doctor said I would have been better suited with an ice quirk instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
(And right after that, Endeavor had knocked over half the tables in the clinic and stormed out while his mother had frantically apologized to the doctor.<br />
<br />
That--hadn't ended the training sessions. Instead, his father had seemed to think that with enough repetition, maybe he could just overcome the weakness in his own body, and god, had he tried. He had persisted through fevers, vomiting, and blisters and burns running up and down his arms, and he still has some of those burn scars under his sleeves.<br />
<br />
It was only when Shouto was born that the training sessions had tapered off, since now Endeavor had the perfect combination of quirks that he had always wanted, but Touya had still lived in fear of his father occasionally deciding to drag him to the training room regardless.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, does it hurt?&quot; Hawks asks, one of his feathers breaking off from the rest of the wings and coming to rest on Touya's hand, a soft, smooth sensation, &quot;Do you think there's some kind of Support equipment that could help you with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm definitely hoping that's the case,&quot; Touya says, staring in fascination at the red feather brushing his hand, &quot;How are you--can I touch it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, go ahead!&quot; Hawks says, the feather twirling up and poking Touya's shoulder, &quot;It's part of my quirk. I can detach and control each of my feathers--but if I detach too many, I can't fly anymore so--yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is awesome,&quot; Touya declares, stroking the edge of the feather and noting that it seems a little ragged, &quot;You have like, the coolest quirk I've ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks' wings flutter around him, &quot;Oh--it's not that cool. Your quirk is so much cooler, and I mean, the feathers get everywhere--my parents don't like it very much--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're wrong then,&quot; Touya says firmly, &quot;Your wings are--really, really neat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks blinks and then smiles at Touya, &quot;You--you really think so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I bet if you wanted to be a hero, you would be super popular too,&quot; Touya says, handing his feather back to Hawks.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's--thank you,&quot; Hawks says, taking the feather from Touya and twirling it around in his hand before looking up again, &quot;Who's your favorite hero?&quot;<br />
<br />
(It's a question that gets tossed around constantly, but honestly he's never given much thought to it. Before the divorce, everyone at school just assumed his favorite would obviously be Endeavor, although sometimes he had said All Might just to piss off his father.<br />
<br />
Really though--it's not like All Might has ever done anything for them, despite how much he might have worked with his father.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Gang Orca,&quot; he decides, after mulling the question over in his head for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gang Orca?&quot; Hawks nose wrinkles, &quot;But he looks so scary!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean he looks so cool,&quot; Touya retorts, &quot;Or that new teen hero Ryuku, she's pretty awesome. Turning into a giant dragon would be amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be so awesome,&quot; Hawks agrees before holding up his Endeavor action figure, &quot;I guess it's kind of obvious who my favorite is, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Touya says, busily fiddling with the CD player so he doesn't have to look at the doll, &quot;I guess--you're not an All Might fan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All Might is boring,&quot; Hawks declares, &quot;He always wins, and he's always laughing and smiling. He seems kind of fake sometimes, you know? Like, not a real person. At least with Endeavor you can tell he's always working hard to try and take the #1 spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Touya stabs at the CD player's buttons for a few seconds (there is so much he could say in response to that but--but the kid seems so genuinely happy, chattering away about his favorite hero, and--he doesn't want to take that away, even if Endeavor is the last person who deserves Hawks' regard).<br />
<br />
&quot;Um--but yeah,&quot; Hawks finishes awkwardly, biting his lip, &quot;I'm probably--boring you right now, I know I talk too much, sorry about that--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Touya interrupts quickly, turning down the volume a bit on the CD player and sitting down, &quot;Sorry, I was just--distracted. So you--think All Might is boring huh? Don't repeat that to my youngest brother; he's only four, but he might try to ice you. Or singe your eyebrows off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks laughs, looking relieved, &quot;I'll try to contain myself. Is your whole family--fire and ice quirks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, mom's ice, and dad was fire,&quot; Touya shrugs, &quot;You saw mine, Fuyumi's is like ice with sparks, Natsu is just straight ice, and Shouto can do fire and ice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, neat,&quot; Hawks muses before his brow wrinkles, &quot;Sorry, but is your dad--not around anymore?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's out of the picture,&quot; Touya improvises (he's going to keep this pretense up as long as possible; he's never had anyone he met not know his entire family situation before), &quot;Mother divorced him, so we moved here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. I'm sorry,&quot; Hawks says, looking down.<br />
<br />
Touya snorts, &quot;Don't be. He's a piece of shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
(And isn't it thrilling to be able to say that out loud now instead of just holding it in and breathing in the fumes of his own resentment?)<br />
<br />
Startled laughter makes its way out of Hawks' throat, &quot;Well if that's the case--I'm not sorry then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're good,&quot; Touya says as the k-pop CD winds to a close, &quot;I don't have any more of that band or really that kind of music, but--do you want to take it with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I--no, I don't have--anything to play it on at home,&quot; Hawks says, glancing back at his own dark apartment before looking back at Touya, &quot;Could I--come by again to listen to it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, anytime,&quot; Touya promises, setting the CD on top of the CD player, &quot;I'll leave it right here, and you can come whenever you want--but it might rain, so maybe I should stick it inside and you can rap on the balcony door--unless, I'm not there, then you might freak Fuyumi or Natsu out--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if you keep my feather?&quot; Hawks asks, offering his feather back to Touya, &quot;I can move it around and make it loop around if I can come over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can control your feathers that far?&quot; Touya asks, taking the feather from Hawks.<br />
<br />
Hawks shrugs, &quot;Well, it's just one, so that's not as hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're really awesome, you know that?&quot; Touya says, admiring the pure red of the feather in his hand.<br />
<br />
Hawks flushes as his wings move to cover his face, &quot;I--thanks. I'll try and--come over tomorrow, Touya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See you then, Hawks,&quot; Touya says with a grin and a wave as Hawks flies back to his own balcony and waves back.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Hawks does come by again the next day, sending his feather up in spirals toward the ceiling, and Touya goes out on the balcony and plays the BlackPink CD again, although this time he also makes Hawks listen to the X Japan CD. Hawks still likes the BlackPink CD better, but he does admit that Silent Jealousy is a pretty good song. He comes back again the day after that, and the next, and the next, which is when Fuyumi spots him.<br />
<br />
With Fuyumi comes Natsuo, and Natsuo also thinks Hawks' wings are the coolest quirk they have ever seen. On the other hand, although they share the same taste in music as far as Touya can tell, Fuyumi does not seem to like Hawks very much.<br />
<br />
&quot;He talks too much,&quot; Fuyumi complains, washing some snow pea leaves, &quot;I'm surprised you can even hear the music. And he leaves feathers all over the place!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The feathers aren't that bad, and he's enthusiastic,&quot; Touya argues, slicing the tofu, &quot;He--doesn't seem to have a lot of people to talk to, so lay off.&quot;<br />
<br />
(Also, it had taken a lot of effort to get Hawks happily chattering at him and not constantly stopping to apologize for going on. If Fuyumi reverses that, he's not going to help her with her history homework.)<br />
<br />
&quot;You're spending a lot of time with him, aren't you?&quot; Fuyumi asks, dumping all the snow pea leaves into a big bowl, &quot;You hardly spend much time with the rest of us now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what this is about?&quot; Touya asks, pouring some oil into the pan, &quot;You guys want more attention from me? I'm already always with you guys--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we really appreciate it, Touya, but--you don't really play with us anymore,&quot; Fuyumi says, holding her hands behind her back, &quot;You're always twirling that feather around, waiting for Hawks to come by.&quot;<br />
<br />
(She has a point; Hawks coming by has become the high point of his day, something to look forward to after a long day of ignoring his classmates' jibes and corralling his siblings.)<br />
<br />
Touya sighs, holding a hand in front of the pan to see if it's warm enough before taking the snow pea leaves and dumping them in, &quot;Look, its--nice to hang out with someone who doesn't know any of our family drama.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuyumi frowns, &quot;How does he not know? The divorce is all over the news.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never told him our last name,&quot; Touya admits, stirring the leaves around, not looking at Fuyumi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Touya,&quot; Fuyumi says, hands on her hips, &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To be fair, I still don't know his real name either,&quot; Touya points out, &quot;So--maybe don't tell him for a bit? I'll get Shouto dressed in the mornings, and let you sleep in later?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if I don't tell him, he's going to find out at some point,&quot; Fuyumi argues, &quot;And it's going to be a lot better coming from you than from anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll deal with that when it comes down to that,&quot; Touya says, taking the pan off of the stove, &quot;Look--I'll invite him inside, and then we can all play together, how's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That--would be better, I guess,&quot; Fuyumi says grudgingly, spooning out the rice from the rice cooker.<br />
<br />
When he puts the idea to Hawks though, the blonde boy hesitates, looking back at his own dark apartment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know...&quot; Hawks says, chewing on his lip, &quot;It's not--I'm really not even supposed to be out of the apartment--and what would your mom think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother won't care; she even wants to meet you,&quot; Touya says, waving a hand.<br />
<br />
(Their mother had seen a picture of Hawks that Natsu had drawn with crayons and had asked him about it, and then the whole story had come tumbling out, with Natsu declaring Hawks to be the coolest guy ever while Fuyumi had vehemently maintained that Hawks was probably in the running for most annoying guy ever, and Touya had crossed his arms and said that whatever the case, Hawks was better than certain siblings who took too long in the one bathroom in the apartment, and their mother had laughed.<br />
<br />
None of them had seen their mother laugh in a long time, so they had sat in stunned silence until their mother's peals of laughter died away, and she had smiled at them and told them that she would like to meet this new friend they had made.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Hawks asks, his feathery eyebrows pinching together, &quot;Am I--am I in trouble?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In trouble?&quot; Touya echoes, &quot;No way. She put Natsu's drawing of you on the top of the fridge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh--that's really cute, actually,&quot; Hawks muses, a small grin forming on his face, &quot;I mean, I guess I could--pop inside really quickly to see the drawing? And then you can try and convince me about that band with that weird French name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;L'Arc en Ciel is not weird,&quot; Touya says haughtily, opening the balcony door and leading Hawks inside, &quot;They're genius, and they've also got an alter-ego called P'unk en ciel that's even better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look forward to hearing it then,&quot; Hawks says, looking around the apartment and spotting Shouto sitting quietly in the hallway making an ice blob, &quot;Oh hey, is that your baby brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that's Shouto, and it's really past his bedtime,&quot; Touya said, quickly walking over and lifting the kid up, &quot;Come on, let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to make an ice All Might,&quot; Shouto says stubbornly, showing off his All Might action figure in one hand while still making blobs of ice with another.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can try that tomorrow, it's bedtime now, remember? Fuyumi and Natsu are already asleep.&quot; Touya says, throwing Shouto over his shoulder as he walks toward the bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sleepy,&quot; Shouto persists, his tiny feet beating against Touya's chest as he waves his arms around and tugs at Touya's sleeves, &quot;I still want to play!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How's this?&quot; Hawks asks as five of his feathers break off and start dancing around Shouto's head, &quot;If you go to bed, these will keep you company?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shouto stares at the feathers enraptured, reaching out a hand to try and grab at them, &quot;Okay,&quot; he says, looking at Hawks curiously over Touya's shoulder, &quot;Are you Touya's friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I--I think I am?&quot; Hawks says, glancing over at Touya.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, he is,&quot; Touya says firmly, setting Shouto on his cot and tucking him in, &quot;Now, stay in bed, okay, Shouto?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Shouto says agreeably, patting Touya's face as the feathers start to twirl around in a mobile figure above him.<br />
<br />
Touya shuts the door and looks at Hawks, &quot;Thanks for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem,&quot; Hawks says with a small grin, &quot;He's a cute kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Less cute when he's burning half of his clothes off,&quot; Touya grumbles, padding back into the kitchen, &quot;We've only got one fireproof onesie for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, I didn't think of that,&quot; Hawks muses as he follows Touya into the kitchen, &quot;You think Endeavor has a bunch of fireproof clothes just hanging in his closet? Did you ever--what's wrong with your arm?&quot;<br />
<br />
Touya glances down and realizes that Shouto had managed to pull his sleeve almost all the way up to his elbow, revealing one of the scarred over burn marks on the back of his arm that had resulted from one of the first times his father had pushed him to go all out.<br />
<br />
(&quot;You're almost perfect, Touya, but you'll never be anything unless you can overcome your weakness.&quot;)<br />
<br />
&quot;When did this happen?&quot; Hawks demands, opening the freezer and frantically digging through the packs of frozen food for a bag of frozen edamame, &quot;Did you--overdo it or something? Hey, are you okay--?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay,&quot; Touya says, pushing away the frozen bag that Hawks tries to press onto his arm while pulling his sleeve back down, &quot;It's not--recent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks' wings flap around him, his feathers swirling around, &quot;Is it--from your quirk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Touya says, looking down at the ground, &quot;It's--my dad thought--that if I just trained harder, then I could--I don't know, get better at it? It didn't--always work out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks stares at Touya for a moment before grabbing his hand, &quot;You're right; your dad really is a piece of shit,&quot; he says firmly, his wings curling around both of them.<br />
<br />
Touya looks up to see Hawks' golden eyes burning with righteous indignation, and--<br />
<br />
(He should probably feel bad for tricking Hawks into saying such things about his idol, but--all he can feel is a blaze of happiness that at last someone on the outside also saw the rot inside the Todoroki manor.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah he is,&quot; Touya says with a short bark of a laugh, adjusting his sleeve before pointing at the crayon scribble of red and yellow pinned to the fridge, &quot;Anyway--that's Natsu's drawing of you. He's a better athlete than an artist, but you know, he tried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it,&quot; Hawks says, looking at in awe and touching the drawing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can keep it if you like, I'm sure he'll draw more,&quot; Touya suggests.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh--no, I wouldn't really--have a place to hide--put it,&quot; Hawks says, looking back at Touya, his hand sliding off the drawing.<br />
<br />
(He doesn't know anything about Hawks' parents, but what blurry outlines he can see does not sit well with him.)<br />
<br />
Touya frowns before asking carefully, &quot;...your parents aren't home much, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Hawks says, his tone uneasy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you--just want to spend the night here?&quot; Touya asks, gesturing at the living room, &quot;It's probably creepy in that apartment just by yourself at night, right? You can take the couch, and I can go get the spare futon to sleep on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks shifts from foot to foot, rubbing his arm, &quot;I'd--I'd really like that, but I don't know when my parents might get back--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can sense vibrations from your feathers right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if you like set up a line of them by your front door?&quot; Touya says gesturing at his apartment's own door, &quot;Then you could sense if it opens and fly over there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That--could work, but when I'm asleep, I don't always feel it,&quot; Hawks says, a few of his feathers breaking off and drifting towards the balcony door.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if you put something loud and clangy there too?&quot; Touya says, going over to the living room and picking up some of Shouto's blocks, &quot;Or something that makes them trip so you'll hear them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Some of Hawks' feathers drift over to take the blocks, &quot;You are so smart,&quot; Hawks says admiringly, looking at Touya.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't act so surprised, I am two years older than you after all,&quot; Touya says, reaching over and ruffling Hawks' feathery blonde hair, &quot;So you'll stay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Hawks says happily, leaning into Touya's hand, &quot;But--I should take the spare futon; you should sleep where you usually sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you take the couch; I'm not being polite, the spare futon is better anyway,&quot; Touya says, walking over to the closet and starting to pull it out.<br />
<br />
(That's a lie; the spare futon is the spare for a reason, but their mother had always brought them up to be polite to whatever guests actually came to their house, and like hell Touya was going to give Hawks the subpar bed.)<br />
<br />
Hawks doesn't look convinced, but Touya just lays out the futon next to the couch and gestures towards the balcony, &quot;No use arguing with me; I still have to show you L'Arc en Ciel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well--okay,&quot; Hawks says, following Touya to the balcony, &quot;But--you're sure your mom will be okay with this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, she's going to love you,&quot; Touya says.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
And Touya is right, his mother is somewhat surprised to find a blonde, winged boy sleeping on their couch the next morning, but she simply sets out an extra bowl of miso soup, rice, and an extra boiled egg before giving Touya a kiss on the head, whispering to him to say hello to his friend for her before leaving for the day<br />
<br />
Hawks stares at the food, eyes round and wide, &quot;Is--all of that, for me?&quot; he asks hesitantly, hands kept carefully on his knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Touya says, plopping Shouto down in one of the chairs and stuffing some toast into his mouth, &quot;You better eat it quick though, before my other siblings get out of the bathroom. You wouldn't think it, but Fuyumi is a breakfast monster.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Liar,&quot; Fuyumi accuses Touya, putting on her glasses while sitting down at the table, &quot;Who's the one who still gets up early weekend mornings to run to the convenience store just to get yakisoba and egg sandwiches for breakfast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's like, once a month,&quot; Touya says, drinking his miso soup and looking over at Hawks who has already somehow cleared his entire bowl of rice, soup, and the egg, &quot;...never mind, you're the breakfast monster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks flushes, his wings drawing in, &quot;Oh--sorry--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not a problem, don't worry about it,&quot; Touya says hastily, wiping Shouto's face with a napkin, &quot;Are you still hungry? Do you want some of mine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you eat it,&quot; Hawks says, looking around the kitchen, &quot;Should I--help clean or--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hawks!&quot; Natsuo cheers as he comes out of the bathroom and sits down at the kitchen table, &quot;When did you get here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er--last night, really--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hawks will be staying over some nights,&quot; Touya cuts in after Hawks looks to him for help, &quot;That way, all of us can play together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome!&quot; Natsuo says with a grin, digging into his food.<br />
<br />
&quot;Natsu, did you remember to get that permission slip for the zoo signed by mom?&quot; Fuyumi asks, helping Shouto pour some soy sauce into the boiled egg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw man,&quot; Natsuo groans, slumping to the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Natsu! It's due today!&quot; Fuyumi scolds.<br />
<br />
Natsuo's head turns to Touya, &quot;Touya, can you sign it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Touya sighs, finishing off his food and gathering up the empty bowls around the table, &quot;Fine, bring it over here, and I'll forge mom's signature, but this is the last time, I swear, Natsu.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Touya!&quot; Natsuo calls out with a grin, scampering to the bedroom to get the permission slip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, let me,&quot; Hawks says, using his feathers to grab up the rest of the empty bowls to take to the sink, &quot;You go sign that form, and I can wash up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a guest--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's really the least I can do, you know,&quot; Hawks says with a smile, tugging the rest of the bowls out of Touya's hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here it is!&quot; Natsuo calls out, waving his permission slip around.<br />
<br />
Touya forges their mother's signature on the form (given how many times Natsu has forgotten to set forms out at night for their mom, he's done this a lot) while Fuyumi gets Shouto's backpack ready, and after a whirl of straightening out uniforms and checking for any missing homework, his three siblings are out the door, and Hawks is setting the last bowl on the drying rack.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really didn't have to do that,&quot; Touya says, gathering up his own school supplies and sticking them in his bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;I kind of did, you guys let me stay over and fed me after all,&quot; Hawks says, drying off his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did your--parents not come home last night?&quot; Touya asks, zipping up his backpack and looking at Hawks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so, no,&quot; Hawks says, his eyes going glassy for a second before focusing again, &quot;No, none of my feathers have been disturbed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that--normal for them?&quot; Touya asks carefully.<br />
<br />
Hawks shuffles in place, wings flapping uneasily behind him, &quot;I mean--kind of? You know, they're busy people, and--they say they need to blow off steam, so--and I am old enough to take care of myself mostly--your mom leaves you guys alone a lot too--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I'm at home to watch everyone, and she still comes home at night and spends weekends with us,&quot; Touya points out.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're not--bad people you know. They just--I'm difficult, I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
(And hasn't he heard nearly the same thing from his mother year after year about his own father?)<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not difficult; you're much easier to deal with than my siblings. If they're not here, you should stay over,&quot; Touya decides, placing a hand on Hawks' shoulder, &quot;Set up the warning system, and keep me company.&quot;<br />
<br />

            <td class="column21 style0 s">Sakusa Kiyoomi should have been the easiest person to be in a secret relationship with. He's next-level private, the type to lock down all of his social media accounts and only post cryptic, blurry selfies or pictures of his plants once every six months. Kiyoomi doesn't even show his face in public, for Christ's sake -- it should have been simple, then, to keep their situation on the down-low. <br />
<br />
Or so Atsumu thought.<br />
<br />
It wasn't a problem in the first few months. He and Kiyoomi kind of fell together, in a way. One post-loss angry hook-up turned into every other weekend spent in Atsumu's apartment, barely making it to the bedroom before they were shedding their clothes and collapsing into each other. Sex with Kiyoomi was great, but what Atsumu really liked was the aftermath -- lazy showers together, sinking into the couch and watching game footage, a new K-drama, or YouTube videos until it got too late for Kiyoomi to reasonably stay. Atsumu pushed his sleep schedule to its limits, finding every excuse to keep Kiyoomi in his presence, just a little longer. <br />
<br />
Eventually, Kiyoomi started sleeping over, and then they were spending time together with their clothes actually on, picking up take-out and just settling into each other's arms, enjoying the other's company.<br />
<br />
Their transition to dating was organic -- one day, Atsumu asked, &quot;Yer my boyfriend, huh?&quot; and Kiyoomi said, &quot;Yeah, it seems like it.&quot; <br />
<br />
They decided not to go public, at least not yet. Atsumu had particularly feral fan-girls and Kiyoomi didn't want to deal with the rest of team making it weird, so they maintained a cool friendship in front of the prying eyes of others, but when it was them alone, Kiyoomi transformed into the sweetest, softest puppy-dog of a human being.<br />
<br />
It was a revelation of Biblical proportions -- life-altering, really. Kiyoomi let Atsumu play with his curls as he laid in his lap; he puckered his lips up at Atsumu and demanded, in a voice far too soft to belong to him, 'kiss.'<br />
<br />
The team didn't suspect a thing, so Atsumu didn't foresee it being an issue -- but that was then, in the confines of practice, a safe-zone where Kiyoomi had his head entirely on straight. Now, in the midst of the warm, cozy izakaya, after an exhausting game against the Red Falcons, Kiyoomi does  not have his head on anywhere near straight. He's in another dimension entirely, three drinks in and flushed from his forehead to his chest. <br />
<br />
Atsumu should've stopped him, but he was pretty distracted by the shots that Meian kept passing him and he didn't think he had to worry too much about Kiyoomi's tolerance. He doesn't drink often, sure, but he's over six feet tall. He's a professional athlete! Three drinks should not do him in.<br />
<br />
But they did. They very much did. <br />
<br />
Kiyoomi sways next to him now, warm thighs burning a hole in Atsumu's shorts as Kiyoomi presses far too close to be considered appropriate for a teammate or friend. He's sitting ramrod straight, trying not to show his clear panic in his eyes as Kiyoomi's hand plays with his under the table. Inunaki is definitely staring at him -- he knows. He totally knows. Hinata does too, judging by the way he keeps smiling at Atsumu. It has nothing to do with the stupid jokes that Atsumu simply cannot hold back when he's drunk, no -- he has to be onto them. Kiyoomi is going to kill Atsumu for allowing this.<br />
<br />
No one says anything, though, so Atsumu tries to breathe. It's hard when the entire building seems to empty of oxygen the moment Kiyoomi threads their fingers together and lolls his head over onto Atsumu's shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Atsu,&quot; he murmurs, lips barely moving. &quot;My Atsu.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are certain aspects of Kiyoomi that Atsumu will simply never be able to process, like the way he can make the perfect doe eyes, his long lashes and blown-out pupils giving the striking impression of an innocent deer. Atsumu has never been able to say no to Kiyoomi, not once, and he's sure that even when they're eighty-five years old, it will be the same. All he has to do is blink, call him 'Atsu' or any other nickname he has for him (which is so many -- they're like ammo, piercing Atsumu right through his poor, weak heart) and he has Atsumu twisted around his finger.<br />
<br />
It's not an issue when they're alone, but right now...<br />
<br />
Atsumu nudges him. &quot;Up, Omi, no fallin' asleep at the bar.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sleeping,&quot; Kiyoomi says and Atsumu holds back a laugh at how  sincere he sounds, slow and precise like he's explaining the plot of a drama that has, like, six different sub-stories going on. &quot;I'm not tired. I just wanted to be close to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Atsumu checks around to see if anybody heard that, but it would be impossible with how Hinata is currently chanting Bokuto's name while he chugs a pitcher of beer. Atsumu turns to Kiyoomi, as inconspicuous as he can, like the way a casual teammate-slash-friend would do, and says, &quot;That's alright. Yer holdin' my hand, right? That's close.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not enough,&quot; Kiyoomi decides, and plops his head down once more. Jesus Lord, Atsumu is only a  man and this is some cosmic level of punishment he's receiving. He makes a mental note to absolutely get Kiyoomi to this level of drunkenness again, but only when they're safely within the confines of one of their apartments, and not in front of the world's nosiest volleyball team. <br />
<br />
Atsumu is all about attention. Something about being a twin makes him demand it from everyone around him, like he didn't get enough growing up (Osamu tells him to shut the fuck up and see a therapist about it, the bastard). It fuels him, most of the time -- on the court, he's driven by people looking at him but he does like his privacy, at least in increments. When it comes to Kiyoomi, well, he kind of likes having their moments to themselves, but if given permission, he would tell everyone in the world how much Kiyoomi means to him. <br />
<br />
Also, he can't deny that it would be fucking hilarious to see his teammates' reaction to the fact that they're dating -- they probably wouldn't believe it. Atsumu doesn't always believe it, and he's one half of the relationship. <br />
<br />
&quot;Omi.&quot; Atsumu shrugs his shoulders ever so gently, just a barely-there movement, and Kiyoomi raises his head to glare at him as if Atsumu chucked him across the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rude,&quot; he grumbles. He takes a quick sip of his drink -- who refilled that? Who's doing this to him?! Then down he goes again, perfectly nestled into Atsumu with his lips dangerously close to his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, he's really wasted,&quot; notes Tomas from across the table. He's red-cheeked and laughing, ten-times drunker than the both of them combined, and thank God for that. Had he been in a better state of mind, he would latch onto the fact that Atsumu is barely keeping his sanity. &quot;Didn't think Sakusa would be a clingy drunk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not,&quot; Kiyoomi insists, lifting his head to shoot Tomas a defiant glower. He's so grumpy when he's drunk, like a big, angry teddy-bear. Well, he's like that most of the time, but he's learned to keep it under control in most settings and be 'cordial' with people. &quot;It's only because -- &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-- Ha!&quot; Atsumu barks out a loud guffaw, startling Kiyoomi enough that he jumps in his seat, and effectively silencing him. &quot;Ya sure are drunk, Omi. Yer very funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiyoomi knits his brows at him. &quot;I'm  not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, drink this.&quot; <br />
<br />
Atsumu practically forces the cup of water down his throat and flashes Tomas his cheekiest smile. Tomas eyes him for a moment longer, but then turns back to Inunaki, who is attempting to challenge Hinata to a tequila-drinking competition. Atsumu makes a mental note to leave before that gets going -- Meian may be the captain, but Atsumu turns into the mom-friend when his teammates get stupid, and he just knows he'll be coerced into cleaning up puke. He can't do that, not when he has Kiyoomi to focus on.<br />
<br />
Kiyoomi, who is currently wiping water away from his lips and giving Atsumu a piercing gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't want water,&quot; he complains.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, ya needed it.&quot; Atsumu shakes his head. Drunk Kiyoomi is something that he is wholly unequipped to handle -- it's like a split personality. Sober Kiyoomi is dignified, quiet, speaks only in blunt truths. Atsumu has always found it endearing, even when Kiyoomi tells him, with utmost seriousness, 'that hairstyle is nowhere near working for you today' or 'brush your teeth before you breathe near me.' It's his love language and Atsumu never minds it. It's what he and the team are used to, after all. <br />
<br />
This version of Kiyoomi -- well, it's disarming. Kiyoomi doesn't lay his head back on Atsumu's shoulder, but he keeps his full attention on him, tapping his finger nails, squeezing his hand, murmuring variations of his name that only he can hear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Atsu, 'Tsumu,  love.&quot; He seems to be singing them along to a song in his head, probably one they hear eighteen times a day on Tik Tok. God, Kiyoomi loves Tik Tok. Once, in an interview, the team was asked to do as many viral dances as they knew from the app and Kiyoomi knew all of them.<br />
<br />
That was probably when Atsumu fell in love, honestly. That, and many, many other small moments in time -- like right now, as Kiyoomi's fingers dance up Atsumu's arm, disappearing under the sleeve of his shirt. <br />
<br />
Atsumu adores him, but fuck, he's going to burst into flames, or disintegrate right on the spot,  Marvel style. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Omi,&quot; he says, just a breath so that nobody hears. &quot;Ya know where we are, right? Ya see the rest of our team?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, ya know, maybe ya shouldn't hang on me like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I like you,&quot; Kiyoomi whines, and it's just above a whisper but Atsumu swears it sounds like a blow horn. Meian glances in their direction, but his eyes are glazed over and he wears a goofy smile on his face as Bokuto explains the logistics of one of their new plays using only dramatic sound effects.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like ya too, Omi-Omi,&quot; Atsumu mutters. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your  Omi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Atsumu agrees.  My Omi, indeed. There's something so debilitating about this side of his boyfriend -- a little helpless and completely precious. Oftentimes, Atsumu calls Kiyoomi 'baby.' It's usually in the bedroom, little more than a gasp when he's half out of his mind, but sometimes it's tender, in moments where they lie together and just exist. He'll brush Kiyoomi's hair out of his eyes and watch as they flutter closed, content, sleepy, sweet. Kiyoomi is hard-edged in public, but when they're together, he really can be a big baby -- Atsumu's baby.<br />
<br />
It's coming out of him now, the pouts, the small declarations of his care. Kiyoomi is only this vulnerable when his inhibitions are lowered, whether it be due to the afterglow of sex, the safety of being in Atsumu's arms, or apparently, several shots of high-end liquor. <br />
<br />
Atsumu aches to wrap him up in a hug, kiss the two moles on his forehead, tell him he loves him dearly, his sweet Omi, but there are many things wrong with that scenario -- one, PDA. What kind of person would Atsumu be if he subjected his teammates to that? They would kick him off the Jackals (just him -- Kiyoomi would get to stay because despite the fact that it took three weeks for him to even acknowledge any of them outside of the court, he's everyone's favorite). Two, there's the whole  secret aspect of the relationship -- the part that was supposed to be easy!<br />
<br />
When Kiyoomi is like this, Atsumu wants to scream their relationship from the rooftops -- 'Hey, everyone in the vicinity of this bar. Look how fuckin' cute my boyfriend is. Don't ya just wanna pinch his cheeks? Well, ya can't because he's mine.' <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; Kiyoomi slurs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hah? Nothin', uh, the weather,&quot; Atsumu stammers out. Months have passed and yet he's still not entirely used to Kiyoomi, and the fact that he reads his mind better than Osamu does sometimes. Atsumu tries to keep cool in all situations, but if he's being honest with himself, he sucks at it, and that's double true when Kiyoomi is around. He loses any swagger he may have had and turns into a bumbling mess. <br />
<br />
Kiyoomi knows this, even in his drunken haze, and he gives Atsumu a dry look. &quot;That's not true. You never think about the weather. It's freezing outside and you didn't even wear a coat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It woulda ruined my look!&quot; He was cold the entire way to the izakaya, but did he complain? Never. He would suffer for fashion and sex appeal, and obviously it worked, since Kiyoomi can't keep his hands off of him.<br />
<br />
Even now, Kiyoomi squeezes his thigh and Atsumu prays to the heavens that nobody hears the mortifying squeak he lets out.<br />
<br />
Kiyoomi definitely heard it if his smirk is any indication, and like the drunken, demure demon that he is, he flashes his eyes at Atsumu and simpers, &quot;You always look good, Atsu. You're beautiful.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ah, abort mission, abort mission! <br />
<br />
Atsumu scans the table and finds that, blessedly, everyone is too distracted by Bokuto regaling them with a tale of the one time he and Hinata entered Hinata's wiener dog in a race and he got first place (because of course even Hinata's tiny dog would be athletically-inclined). Atsumu breathes a sigh of relief, and then, as subtly as he can, turns to Kiyoomi. &quot;Yer gonna blow our cover, Omi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I don't care,&quot; he replies, petulant as ever. <br />
<br />
&quot;It was yer idea in the first place!&quot;<br />
<br />
Technically, it was a joint decision, but Kiyoomi knows Atsumu airs his business out to everyone on a daily basis. The choice to keep it hidden was, like, ninety-eight percent Kiyoomi. <br />
<br />
He seems to have forgotten that, though. It's completely gone with the rest of his brain cells, drowned in the vodka cranberry, or whatever drink he threw back three of. <br />
<br />
Kiyoomi sighs, like Atsumu is heavily inconveniencing him. From across the table, Barnes throws a glimpse at them and smiles a toothy, intoxicated smile. Atsumu can't decipher it -- Barnes always smiles, but this one seems to mean something.<br />
<br />
Or Atsumu is crazy. Kiyoomi has driven him to the point of insanity. It was bound to happen sooner or later.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think,&quot; Kiyoomi slurs, not even trying to be quiet, &quot;That everybody already knows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Inunaki asks suddenly, pulled away from watching Tomas try to balance a shot glass on his face. &quot;What do we know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, ya got bat hearin' or somethin'?&quot; Atsumu snaps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bats do have very good hearing,&quot; Kiyoomi confirms, his little encyclopedia. Atsumu turns to smile at him, against his will, because he's just -- how the fuck is somebody that cute? When he turns back to Inunaki to lie his ass off, he finds the entirety of his team now watching him, all wearing matching grins.<br />
<br />
It's horrifying. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, you two just aren't as subtle as you think you are,&quot; Meian says, snorting. Hinata catches on, nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been noticing your flirting for weeks,&quot; adds Barnes. &quot;It's completely obvious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Omi-san, do you have a crush on Atsumu?&quot; Hinata teases, waggling his eyebrows in a ridiculously exaggerated way. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't answer that, Omi,&quot; Atsumu blurts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, damn it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aha!&quot; Inunaki cries. &quot;I knew it! The other day after practice, I saw Atsumu ruffle his hair, and,&quot; he continues, like he's a detective who finally cracked a baffling case, &quot;Sakusa was laying his head on Atsumu's shoulder earlier. He barely comes near me without spraying me down with sanitizer first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because I saw you sneeze without covering your mouth once,&quot; Kiyoomi grouses, filter eliminated, decimated to the point that it may never come back. &quot;Atsumu sneezes into a tissue, every time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, 'course I do,&quot; Atsumu mumbles, embarrassed but figuring it won't help his case if he freezes up and acts as if he's forgotten human speech. &quot;Don't wanna risk spreadin' any germs to ya.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's why I love you so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh. Uh oh. That was -- not something Kiyoomi should've said out loud. An implosion is imminent, any minute now and the entire restaurant will be brought down with the force of -- <br />
<br />
&quot;Love?!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's Bokuto who catches up first, and coincidentally, it's Bokuto whose voice can be magnified enough to be heard across the entirety of Osaka. &quot;Omi-kun, did you say  love?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Kiyoomi confirms proudly. He's going to die later, when he realizes that he did this. He's probably going to leave the Jackals and flee the country, and Atsumu will have to follow him but he's not good at learning languages, would've failed English if Osamu didn't take his tests for him, and -- <br />
<br />
&quot;Atsumu,&quot; Kiyoomi declares, &quot;is the love of my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God,&quot; Atsumu whimpers. &quot;Omi, yer killin' me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby,&quot; he corrects. &quot;I'm your baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is somebody recording this?&quot; Inunaki demands. &quot;Somebody better be recording this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll break all of yer phones,&quot; Atsumu threatens. &quot;I'll throw 'em in the river. I'll throw  you in the river.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, wait, wait,&quot; Hinata stops them all. &quot;So, you two are actually together and didn't tell us?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, someone here didn't want to,&quot; Atsumu sighs. &quot;Remember that, Omi?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a dumb idea,&quot; Kiyoomi decides. Well. That's settled then. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure he's not just drunk and making up stories?&quot; asks Tomas. &quot;I mean, no offense, but Atsumu, you don't seem like Sakusa's type.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I like blondes,&quot; Kiyoomi says. &quot;Well, I like one blonde. My blonde. My Atsu.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he might have alcohol poisoning,&quot; Meian says, frowning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it that hard to believe?!&quot; Atsumu protests. Sure, it's far-fetched but they're questioning Kiyoomi's taste, not his, and Atsumu is a catch, so what the fuck?<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it's just -- he's about to fall over, 'Tsumu,&quot; Bokuto frets, and ah, so he is. Kiyoomi is swaying, eyes closed, about to knock right into Atsumu's side. He gets an arm around his waist, steadying him, and Kiyoomi presses against it, content now that Atsumu is holding him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna go home,&quot; he mumbles. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Omi-Omi, I'll bring ya home,&quot; Atsumu promises. He glares at his team in warning. &quot;The rest of ya -- not a word about this tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our lips are sealed,&quot; Hinata swears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pft. Mine aren't.&quot; Inunaki cackles. &quot;I'm telling this story at your wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let us know when we can put it on Twitter,&quot; Tomas quips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until we've talked to our PR team,&quot; Barnes says, always the responsible one. <br />
<br />
&quot;You all give me a headache,&quot; bemoans Meian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, anyway,&quot; Atsumu interrupts, a vein in his forehead threatening to bulge out. The MSBY Black Jackals are going to send him into goddamn cardiac arrest -- if Kiyoomi doesn't do it first. As it stands, Kiyoomi is digging his fingers into Atsumu's shirt, wrinkling it and playing absent-mindedly with a button and the thought of his teammates latching onto  that piece of ammo is enough to make Atsumu push him up and away from the table and lead him out the door. The jeers that follow them echo through the entire izakaya.<br />
<br />
When the cool winter air hits them, Kiyoomi shivers, and like it's instinct, Atsumu wraps his arm around his shoulders.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Omi, what am I gonna do with ya?&quot; he sighs, mostly to himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Love me,&quot; Kiyoomi supplies. <br />
<br />
Atsumu laughs, a full-bodied, belly-laugh because God, he really does love Kiyoomi, and he's known from the moment he first fell asleep on Atsumu's chest, worn-out and exhausted and entirely vulnerable a few weeks after they started going out officially. Atsumu has loved a lot, but never had anything been as simple as falling in love with Kiyoomi. It was a puzzle piece falling into a place, something as instinctive as breathing. All of the cheesy songs that his ma used to play in the kitchen on Sunday mornings made sense when Atsumu found Kiyoomi -- loving him is easy; loving him is fun. <br />
<br />
Kiyoomi is an odd little thing -- he's an insane presence on the court, a powerhouse, a stoic, imposing man, but with Atsumu, he's just Omi.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do love ya, my sweet Omi.&quot; He ruffles his curls and Kiyoomi pouts, shaking them back into place. &quot;I don't get ya, but I sure love ya.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiyoomi hums. &quot;I just thought everyone should know. How happy you make me. I didn't think -- well, it's you, so I didn't realize that I would care for you so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'Well it's me.'&quot; Atsumu snorts. &quot;Romantic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're aware of who you were in high school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I am,&quot; he chuckles. &quot;And so are you, and yet here we are -- workin' out pretty damn well, in my opinion.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Atsu,&quot; he says, very serious, like he may confess a deep and dark secret, or say something he would never dare say sober -- maybe he'll tell Atsumu how much he secretly fell for him the moment they locked eyes across the net at their first training camp, or how he pined from him afar for years, or that he fantasizes about spending the rest of his life with him -- &quot;I think I might be sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Okay, okay. Let's go home.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
-x-<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Through a truly monumental effort on Atsumu's part, Kiyoomi does not throw up in the streets. He may forget everything else he's said tonight, but Kiyoomi would remember that for the rest of his life and use it as an excuse to never touch alcohol, or even go out in public, ever again. He has to give some credit to Hinata, who always chooses an izakaya within walking distance of their shared complex because he  plans to blackout on Thursday nights and stumble home.<br />
<br />
Atsumu tucks Kiyoomi into his bed and force-feeds him water and an ibuprofen. Kiyoomi grumbles about it and makes grabby-hands at Atsumu, swatting away his attempts at care and repeatedly asking for cuddles.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I don't do all these preventative measures, yer gonna feel like shit in the mornin', now drink more of this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll drink it if you lay down with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, ya won't.&quot; Atsumu knows how Kiyoomi operates -- he haggles to get what he wants, like some sort of character in an RPG, and nearly never holds up his end of the bargain. Once Atsumu lays down on that bed, the water will be long-forgotten and Kiyoomi will wake up with a massive hangover and cottonmouth, blaming Atsumu for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll cuddle ya right after, Omi, just drink yer water.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiyoomi narrows his eyes at him, and it's really just -- it's unreal, how cute somebody of Kiyoomi's size and stature can be. He's a whole-ass man and yet Atsumu is melting like he's a Poodle puppy, the ones that fit in your hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, baby,&quot; he tries. &quot;For me.&quot; <br />
<br />
That does it. A flush creeps into Kiyoomi's cheeks, and he takes the cup, draining it hurriedly. Atsumu takes it and refills it, sitting it on the nightstand, before crawling under the covers with Kiyoomi. He wastes no time in wrapping his arms around him, and Kiyoomi snuggles up against his chest, burying his head in Atsumu's neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Love you,&quot; he mumbles. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and so does the whole team,&quot; Atsumu teases, kissing his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you mad?&quot; Kiyoomi asks, voice small. He gets like this, too, sometimes -- unsure, careful, and Atsumu will not stand for it. He huffs and lifts Kiyoomi softly by his curls, bringing them eye-to-eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I be mad? I'll tell the world I love ya, Omi, I don't care. I was worried you'd regret it, is all, since ya wanted to be so secretive.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kiyoomi stares at him, purposeful, eyes a little watery and glazed. &quot;I thought  you didn't wanna tell anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?&quot; Atsumu barks out a laugh. &quot;I tell everyone I know everythin' -- all of Instagram knows what I eat for breakfast every mornin'. 'Course I wanna show off my boyfriend.&quot; He kisses him, right smack in the middle of his forehead. Kiyoomi crinkles his eyebrows at the sensation, but softens. &quot;I love ya very much, baby. My sweet baby boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it when you call me that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's why I do it.&quot; He kisses his moles, his cheek, each of his eyelids. &quot;We can make it official tomorrow -- if ya wake up and remember any of this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Kiyoomi promises. &quot;Tomorrow. We'll tell everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't wait to post all the cute pictures I have of ya.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiyoomi smiles. It brightens the dark room like the moon in the sky. He presses a kiss to Kiyoomi's lips, and he settles, closing his eyes and clutching tighter to Atsumu's back. It doesn't take longer than a minute for his breathing to even out. <br />
<br />
There's going to be a lot of damage control in the morning -- a precious secret has been revealed tonight, but Atsumu has never minded the thought of showing off this Kiyoomi to the world, the Kiyoomi that is all his. </td>

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The thought is abrupt and unbidden, and Kim Dokja nearly falls over onto his ass from shock when he sees it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Fortunately, he's able to retain just enough muscle control that he merely stumbles briefly. Yoo Jonghyuk sends him a balefully unimpressed look, but Kim Dokja doesn't have the will nor brain capacity to deal with that right now.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He's more concerned about the... questionable line of text that had just come floating at him from Yoo Jonghyuk's direction.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] has been on an odd rampage lately, activating seemingly on its own whims and somehow always managing to find the exact right moment to reveal his companions' most troubling inner-thoughts. The nature of the skill, in that he can only see thoughts which are about himself, only makes it all the more awkward. Kim Dokja shudders as he remembers Han Sooyoung's twisted fantasies about slapping him repeatedly in the face.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Of course, that pales in comparison to what he just heard from Yoo Jonghyuk. Kim Dokja stops and crouches down with the pretense of tying his shoelaces in order to hide his bewildered facial expression, ignoring Yoo Jonghyuk's impatient glare. No, how can he even take this guy seriously anymore after becoming privy to such things?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is absorbing your mental shock!]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja's head cools down. Okay, wait. He can think about this logically.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In fact, now that he's really pondering it, Yoo Jonghyuk's errant thought could have many different, more innocuous meanings. For instance, it could mean that Yoo Jonghyuk wants to bring Kim Dokja to his knees through battle. He probably revels in the fact that his combat prowess exceeds Kim Dokja's-- such matters are all Yoo Jonghyuk seems to place importance on anyways. Right, Kim Dokja decides as he loops his laces around his fingers. That makes infinitely more sense.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Why had his mind immediately gone to the gutter, anyway? It must be all the porn he read during high school. The more Kim Dokja thinks about it, the more he becomes convinced that there is nothing sexual in nature about Yoo Jonghyuk's thought. Come on, this is Yoo Jonghyuk they're talking about. There's no way a painfully straight-laced bastard like that is having those types of thoughts in broad daylight--<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[ I could just tip his face up right now and slide my cock between his lips. ] <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja's hands jerk violently, and his shoelaces explode into a million and one small fiber fragments. He watches as they float serenely to the ground, dazed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...what the hell are you doing?&quot; Yoo Jonghyuk's gruff voice comes from above, and Kim Dokja abruptly snaps out of it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He stands up, and carefully doesn't look at Yoo Jonghyuk. &quot;Aw, man, I just bought these shoes a couple scenarios ago,&quot; he says loudly, shaking his head stiffly as if he's disappointed. &quot;Guess they're too low quality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Mass Production Maker' is pouting.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja ignores the indirect message and resumes walking. He can feel Yoo Jonghyuk's vaguely annoyed and mystified gaze on his back, and his neck grows warm. After a second, Yoo Jonghyuk continues walking behind him silently. He's clearly noticed Kim Dokja's odd behavior, but thankfully doesn't say anything. For once, Kim Dokja appreciates the fact that Yoo Jonghyuk is a 'keep everything bottled up inside until he explodes' kind of bastard.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So. That just happened. Kim Dokja taps his fingers against the side of his thigh nervously. He glances upward again, just to make sure that he hadn't misread earlier. The words, although fading at the edges, are still there, legible, and very much unchanged. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' is wondering what you are looking at.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja's face flushes even hotter, and he quickly rips his gaze away. He doesn't know how he should be feeling right now. Relieved that he isn't actually hallucinating? Horrified at being thought about in such a manner? Curious? Angry? Confused? Or, perhaps, hopef--<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He slaps himself on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The stinging pain is insignificant, but sudden enough that it effectively stops his mind from wandering down a weird path. Of course, the method has its drawbacks as well, and everybody in his vicinity stops what they're doing to look at him like they think he's mentally ill. Han Sooyoung in particular perks up, looking intrigued.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need someone to slap the other side t--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, thank you,&quot; Kim Dokja cuts her off. He rotates his shoulders, as if to physically shake off his embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is growing thicker.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja has come to the wise, magnanimous decision to simply pretend that he knows nothing. It's for the best, really, and minimizes the awkwardness on both sides. Right, he never saw anything, and he never will. Yoo Jonghyuk doesn't want to fuck him, and he never will. Kim Dokja repeats this ridiculous mantra in his head somewhat manically.  <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Besides, he still has his doubts about the validity of what he just saw. [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] hasn't led him astray thus far, but no system is 100-percent flawless. Maybe there had been some error in translation, or analysis, or--<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[ It' s calle d  'Om niscient' for  a  re ason, idi ot Ki m Dok j a ] <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A glint of hysteria enters Kim Dokja's eyes at the Fourth Wall's disgruntled words, but the smile plastered on his face doesn't waver. He claps his hands together with the renewed vigor of a man ardently pretending his problems don't exist. &quot;Alright, everybody,&quot; he says, voice unnaturally bright and upbeat. &quot;The upcoming scenario is going to be difficult, but as long as we work together and believe in the brilliant power of friendship, we can get through anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The sight of [Kim Dokja's Company] gathered together in front of him is both a familiar and dependable one. He sweeps his eyes over each of his companions' faces (except for Yoo Jonghyuk, naturally), who are all looking back at him. He feels just as refreshed and energized as back when the possibility of the man he spent his teenage years half in love with having sexual fantasies about him was zero. Well, it's still zero, Kim Dokja reminds himself. A bead of sweat rolls slowly down his temple. Anyways, back to the matter at hand...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahjussi, why are you talking like that?&quot; Lee Jihye tilts her head at him.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Lee Gilyoung looks at him, concerned. &quot;Hyung, are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja's smile freezes on his face.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Han Sooyoung flips her hair over her shoulder. &quot;Che,&quot; she scoffs condescendingly, &quot;do you think you're the protagonist of 'SSSSS-Grade Infinite Regressor' or something? Arrogant bastard.&quot;<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[1,000 coins have been sponsored!]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja blinks at the stream of indirect messages. In the background, the others begin chiming in to make fun of him as well, but he instinctively turns to seek out one particular person's reaction.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yoo Jonghyuk has already looked away from the group, sitting down nearby and pulling out his trademark Black Demon Sword with a disinterested expression. A small line of text is floating above his head, which makes him look like an angsty Pokemon.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[ What an idiot. ] <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now that's more like it. The content of the message is scornful, and therefore incredibly Yoo Jonghyuk-esque. But as if it can't help but reveal the subject's intuitive, subconscious feelings, the text itself is tinged with warmth at the edges, a hazy outline in muted red-orange color.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja stares at it for long enough that he feels the warmth reach out to him, and seep slowly into his skin. He only looks away, honey-like heat swimming in his veins, when Yoo Jonghyuk levels a fearsome glare in his direction. Even as he turns his attention elsewhere, though, the corners of his lips stay upturned in a small smile.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Things get better before they get rapidly worse.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja is endlessly (and mistakenly) relieved when more than a month passes, and he has yet to hear any more of Yoo Jonghyuk's dubious bouts of daydreaming. Although, that may be mostly due to the way Kim Dokja has resorted to running away with his tail between his legs whenever [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] so much as shows signs of activating near Yoo Jonghyuk. As the saying goes, ignorance is bliss. And Kim Dokja is feeling very blissful indeed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...Never mind the fact that he has hardly spent any time with Yoo Jonghyuk outside of a scenario lately. It leaves a part of him feeling strangely empty and bereft, a space that he both wants and doesn't want to fill. The company has clearly noticed Kim Dokja's avoidance of Yoo Jonghyuk as well, but none of them say anything, probably figuring that it is something that will be resolved with time.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[ Wha t are yo u  so afra id of? ] <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The pointed question makes Kim Dokja shift uncomfortably. &quot;Shut up,&quot; he mutters at the Fourth Wall, and turns his face hurriedly to the side when Yoo Jonghyuk looks up vigilantly at the noise.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, all tentatively good things must come to an end.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The illusion is unceremoniously shattered a short while later in the middle of a scenario. As they've entered the upper-digits and the difficulty level has risen accordingly, they are usually too busy trying to stay alive (or in Kim Dokja's case... not) during scenarios to be worrying about interpersonal relationships.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, today's scenario is different.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[A new sub-scenario has been commissioned by 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire'.]<br />
<br />
[Sub-Scenario - Company Outing]<br />
<br />
Category: Hidden<br />
<br />

<br />
Clear Conditions: Have a fun company outing with the members of [Kim Dokja's Company].<br />
<br />
Time Limit: 24 Hours<br />
<br />
Compensation: The treasures of love and friendship<br />
<br />
Failure: 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' will be incredibly sad<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The company stares at the screen in front of them blankly. Kim Dokja opens his mouth, but he doesn't know what to say. Maybe he should have seen this coming-- of course Uriel would do something like this. There is perhaps no existence in the universe that cares more about his relationship with Yoo Jonghyuk. Their one-sided 'cold war' would naturally be cause for concern from her.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Han Sooyoung is the one to break the silence. &quot;Are you kidding me?&quot; She asks loudly, and turns to Jung Heewon. &quot;Hey, why is your sponsor acting like a meddlesome neighborhood ahjumma?&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' is puffing her cheeks indignantly.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' says she merely wishes for the company to be happy.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;The company?&quot; Han Sooyoung snorts derisively. &quot;I think we all know who this scenario is really for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As if on cue, Kim Dokja feels all of their gazes fall on him and Yoo Jonghyuk. He clears his throat awkwardly, and decides to speak up. God knows that this guy standing behind him would just continue brooding silently forever. &quot;I don't know if this is necessary,&quot; Kim Dokja says, trying his best to sound apologetic rather than nervous. &quot;I appreciate the good will, Uriel. But [Kim Dokja's Company] is totally fine. And we've got quite a few scenarios to do preparations for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' is frowning.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' wishes for 'Demon King of Salvation' and Incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk' to mend their relationship.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ah. She really just called them out like that.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The rest of the company look thoughtful, and Kim Dokja shifts nervously. Thankfully, Han Sooyoung begins speaking abrasively again. &quot;Hey, there isn't even a proper reward for this thing! Just what the hell is 'the treasures of love and friendship'? Can I eat that?&quot; She puts her hands on her hips, &quot;are all archangels from 'Eden' such cheapskates?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' says she is willing to give as many coins as 'Metatron' will let her.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how many is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' will give 2,000 coins.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Han Sooyoung looks at the sky, unimpressed. &quot;That's pathetic,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' is embarrassed.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is laughing at 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire'.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' will kindly donate 5,000 coins to the pitiful 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire'.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Han Sooyoung taps her foot. &quot;7,000 coins? Is that all Kim Dokja and Yoo Jonghyuk's beautiful companionship is worth to you guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja opens his mouth, feeling like he should stop this before Han Sooyoung really gets going, but the indirect messages have already begun pouring in.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[A constellation who likes comradeship has donated 5,000 coins.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' has donated 1,000 coins.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword' has donated 3,000 coins.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has donated 10,000 coins.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden is congratulating himself on his own generosity.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' has donated two historical-grade Fables.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[A constellation who likes to change gender has donated 2,000 coins.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' has donated 3,000 coins and 10 barrels of wine.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Mass Production Maker' has donated 10% of the royalties for the Ferraghini XI.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...just how fucking bored are these constellations?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[Senior-level Dokkaebi 'Bihyung' has donated 5,000 coins.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja lifts his head to look at Bihyung, feeling inexplicably betrayed. &quot;Is that even allowed?&quot; He asks incredulously. &quot;Also, why?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Bihyung has the decency to look somewhat sheepish. &quot;[Kim Dokja's Company] is the most popular channel in the Korean Peninsula, I have to help keep the viewers happy,&quot; he explains. He adds unnecessarily, &quot;and I also want to see you and that guy make up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Han Sooyoung is peering at the indirect messages filling the screen shrewdly, while the rest of the companions look increasingly impressed as more and more donations flood in. Kim Dokja can feel the situation rapidly slipping out of his control. &quot;Wait, guys,&quot; he says, &quot;think about this! We only have 23 days left until--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It won't kill you to take a break every once in a while, you know,&quot; Jung Heewon interrupts him leisurely. She looks back at the scenario screen, amused. &quot;Besides, do you really want to be the one responsible for making Uriel 'incredibly sad'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja stares at her speechlessly, who stares back nonchalantly. His shoulders slump in defeat after a moment. As if sensing his dangerously wavering resolve, the kids immediately come swarming in. &quot;Ah, hyung!&quot; Lee Gilyoung starts shouting and runs up to him, &quot;can we have a picnic? And play Kick the Can? And go swimming in the river? And catch beetles together in the forest? And--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yah, Lee Gilyoung, stop being so selfish!&quot; Shin Yoosung catches up to him and cries out. &quot;We can't only do what you want to. Ahjussi, please can we go to a family restaurant together? I want to get ice-cream, too. And go to an arcade to play with all the claw machines.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Shin Yoosung, don't you think you're being too greedy? If hyung does those things with you, then he won't have any time for me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares about you?&quot; Shin Yoosung tilts her chin up.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Lee Gilyoug mimics her and puffs his chest out. &quot;Fine, then let's ask hyung who he wants to spend time with more!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They both turn on their heels to look up at Kim Dokja expectantly. Their eyes are large and sparkling, like two equally cute and vicious little puppy dogs. Kim Dokja looks down at them and finds himself at a momentary loss for words. Both of them look like all of their pride and dignity is riding on his answer, and his answer alone.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Before he can gather his wits about, two pale hands find their way to rest on the top of the kids' heads.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yoo Sanga stands behind them with a genial smile. &quot;Now, don't fight, kids,&quot; she says. The children continue pouting and glaring at each other, though they drop their aggressive stances and turn to her obediently. Kim Dokja looks at her gratefully, but she meets his eyes and smirks instead.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you guys are disappointed,&quot; Yoo Sanga continues, &quot;but Dokja-ssi will be spending all his time with Jonghyuk-ssi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja's blinks, disoriented, at the unexpected betrayal. The kids grumble and send irritated looks at Yoo Jonghyuk, who ignores them, but acquiesce as if they accept that this fact truly cannot be helped. Yoo Sanga spares Kim Dokja one more smile before leading the kids away, and he does a full-body shudder after she turns around. That woman is scary. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the other companions seem to have come to a brand-new conclusion. Lee Jihye in particular is jumping up and down excitedly, eyes glittering, and she suddenly looks every bit the 17 year-old girl she is. &quot;Oh my God,&quot; she squeals, &quot;does this mean Master and ahjussi are going on a date?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Maritime War God' has donated 3,000 coins.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' has also started jumping up and down.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja's eyeballs threaten to bulge out of his head at the words, and he frantically looks around for someone to help him deal with this dangerous situation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Next to him, Han Sooyoung's eyes have practically turned into dollar signs as she continues pouring over the donation screen, completely oblivious to the outside world. Yoo Sanga and the children are some distance away, busy playing a game together. Jung Heewon looks like she is thoroughly enjoying the situation, and Lee Hyunsung smiles apologetically from beside her. Lee Seolhwa, the one person who should definitely not be okay with this, gives Kim Dokja a huge thumbs-up and smile when their eyes meet.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja stumbles slightly backwards, feeling equal parts disoriented and betrayed. He shakes his head and attempts to right himself. Okay, so they've left him with no choice. He had wanted to avoid doing this, but desperate times call for desperate measures. He takes a deep breath and turns to the final person in the company.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Yoo Jonghyuk ignores Kim Dokja and replies curtly.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Silence.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja's pupils shake, stupefied. &quot;Yes, what?&quot; He asks dumbly.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yoo Jonghyuk looks at him like Kim Dokja is a bug he can't wait to squash underneath his combat boots. &quot;Yes, we're going on a date.&quot; He says, like that should be obvious.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja stares at him.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' is screaming in happiness.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He blinks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is cackling approvingly at Incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk's bluntness.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is choking on his drink.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Same, though.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' admires the free and courageous spirit of Incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk'.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' would like to welcome Incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk' to the family.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Father of the Rich Night' is looking at Incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk' appraisingly.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja rubs his eyes vigorously to clear them, and looks up again. The messages are still there, and increasing at an exponential rate. They are also getting more and more ludicrous by the second.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is volunteering the Underworld for the wedding reception.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' says she would like to be a bridesmaid.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' says that he better be a groomsman or else.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' boasts that he gives the best wedding presents.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Mass Production Maker' says he gives far better wedding presents.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is rubbing his head happily at this development.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword' sincerely congratulates 'Demon King of Salvation' and Incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk' on their timely engagement.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[Tales of your magnificent romance is being spread throughout the 'Star Stream'!]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[550,000 coins have been sponsored!]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja watches the messages scroll past with a detached sense of horror and amazement, until the last two pop up vehemently like a bucket of ice water being dumped over his head. He abruptly snaps back to reality.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now wait a goddamn second.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
What the actual fuck is happening right now? Kim Dokja shakes his head; rather than 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World,' is he perhaps actually living in a C-rate fanfiction? Everything about this situation is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is absorbing your mental shock!]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is shocked by how much mental shock you have from this.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has absorbed the majority of your mental shock.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja takes a deep breath and turns around, hand reaching out to grab Yoo Jonghyuk's collar. The bastard looks utterly unfazed, and if Kim Dokja looks closely, perhaps even a bit smug at the abrupt turn of events. Of course, that only serves to agitate Kim Dokja further.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You-- you--&quot; He splutters uncharacteristically, and Yoo Jonghyuk, the fucking asshole, smirks at him. &quot;What the fuck!&quot; Kim Dokja blurts out.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yoo Jonghyuk's eyes are dark and amused as they bear into Kim Dokja's. &quot;What are you complaining about now?&quot; He asks unconcernedly. &quot;Look at how many coins and useful items we're receiving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I complaining about??? I'm complaining about--&quot; Kim Dokja starts saying incredulously, only to choke on his words as a new barrage of indirect messages come flying in.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire' is squealing for you to kiss.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is repeatedly chanting 'Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!']<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is cheering on Incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk's free and courageous spirit.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' does not know how to react.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is wiping a motherly tear from her eye.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The constellation 'Father of the Rich Night' says their son has truly grown into a man.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[The absolute majority of constellations in the channel would like 'Demon King of Salvation' and Incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk' to kiss.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja stares at the messages, slack-jawed. &quot;Are you fucking kidding me?&quot; He exclaims after a moment. &quot;This is not how it's going to happen--&quot; He lets go of Yoo Jonghyuk's collar, only now realizing how close together their faces are, and starts to back away. Before he can get too far, however, something behind him blocks his escape and pushes him further into Yoo Jonghyuk's personal space instead.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja turns his head. Han Sooyoung is glaring at him, her hands braced on his back.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
[Kiss him, Kim Dokja.]<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
She hisses at him through 'Midday Tryst,' and his eyebrows scrunch up.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[Why???] He sends back, trying to push back against Han Sooyoung, but she is seriously freakishly strong and doesn't budge.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
[Do you know how much free shit we're getting out of this?] <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
[...you're such a materialistic asshole.] <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
[Shut the fuck up and kiss him.] <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja abruptly remembers that this is a channel open between all three of them. He turns desperately to Yoo Jonghyuk in a last ditch attempt.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
[Are you okay with being exploited like this?] <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Yoo Jonghyuk lifts an unimpressed eyebrow at him. Instead of answering, he asks, [Do you really not want to kiss me?] <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja freezes at the completely unexpected question.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[Yeah, don't you want to kiss him?] Han Sooyoung chimes in unnecessarily, and he flips her off without turning around.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He narrows his eyes both disbelievingly and thoughtfully. Yes, Yoo Jonghyuk is a bastard, but he isn't a bastard who has this twisted kind of sense of humor. The expression on his face reveals absolutely nothing, but he doesn't look away either, simply waiting for Kim Dokja to take the next step.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja stares at him, immensely conflicted. What kind of question is that anyways? Do you really not want to kiss me?-- who just says shit like that?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[Kim Dokja wanted desperately to kiss Yoo Jonghyuk.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja's eye twitches. The Fourth Wall can go die in a pit already. He ignores the embarrassing narration inside his head, and studies Yoo Jonghyuk closely instead.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ah, shit. This bastard just has to be inhumanly fucking handsome. Not for the first time nor the last, Kim Dokja laments the unfairness of the protagonist.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And that's the thing-- you'd have to be either dead or a eunuch to not feel something whilst being stared at intensely by a face like that. Although Kim Dokja has died before, he is very much a living, breathing person right now.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So yes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He feels something, goddammit.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[Kim Dokja thought, 'fuck it.']<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He surges forward before he can think better of it and presses his mouth to Yoo Jonghyuk's. He closes his eyes so he doesn't have to see the explosion of indirect messages that is sure to follow, hands clutching lightly at Yoo Jonghyuk's biceps. To his credit, Yoo Jonghyuk responds immediately, as if he had been absolutely confident that Kim Dokja would kiss him.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja feels a touch to the small of his back, pulling him in until their bodies are pressed flush together. He had been planning to pull away after a couple seconds of contact at most, but Yoo Jonghyuk is evidently on a different page from him. He has to gasp when he feels a tongue swipe over his bottom lip. The motion is slow but not tentative, and would you look at that-- he ends up with Yoo Jonghyuk's tongue inside his mouth.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja's body reacts before his brain can fully comprehend the fact that him and Yoo Jonghyuk are kissing at all, and his lips part under Yoo Jonghyuk's easily. He faintly feels a calloused hand taking hold of his jaw, but the touch is light and gentle, a complete juxtaposition to the fervent movement of their mouths against each other. The experience is made all the more intense by the way that Kim Dokja keeps his eyes closed; like this, he feels utterly wrapped up in Yoo Jonghyuk, who continues kissing him like he wants to devour him whole. He would be lying if he said that it didn't feel good. Really, annoyingly good.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[Kim Dokja could keep doing this forever.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yoo Jonghyuk presses closer. He does something absolutely wicked with his tongue, and Kim Dokja lets out the smallest whimper at the back of his throat. It is barely loud enough for Kim Dokja himself to realize he's made it, but Yoo Jonghyuk's reaction to it is instant. His arm tightens around Kim Dokja's waist almost painfully, like he can't help himself. The kiss turns even more relentless until Kim Dokja doesn't even have the capacity to remember to breathe anymore.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He is the one to pull away first, but only after it becomes absolutely necessary. I.e. he would be at risk of passing out if he didn't. His hands push lightly at Yoo Jonghyuk's chest as he gulps in lungfuls of air greedily. Kim Dokja finally opens his eyes, and is mildly gratified by the way Yoo Jonghyuk looks just as disheveled as he feels for once.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yoo Jonghyuk's arm lingers heavy and hot around his waist, but Kim Dokja can't find it in himself to mind the contact too much. They're both breathing heavily, refusing to look away as they catch their breaths. Yoo Jonghyuk's eyes are as fierce and concentrated as they always are. Kim Dokja swallows involuntarily; he can faintly feel the rhythm of Yoo Jonghyuk's heartbeat underneath his fingertips through the thin fabric of his shirt.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja's lips are still tingling from the kiss. He licks his bottom lip absentmindedly, only for Yoo Jonghyuk's eyes to darken at the action. A flash of heat stirs in Kim Dokja's stomach, and his chin begins tipping upwards again on its own volition, as if entranced--<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Han Sooyoung says loudly, &quot;well. That was intense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
--Kim Dokja jumps.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Right. There are other people here.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He turns around, only to immediately make eye contact with Han Sooyoung, whose expression is both amused and disturbed. There's something like pitying laughter in her gaze, which Kim Dokja decides he doesn't like. He quickly looks away.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The next candidate doesn't seem to be much better, however, as Lee Jihye stares at them, cheeks flushed and eyes shining. Kim Dokja can practically see pink hearts floating in the air around her as she watches the two of them. Beside her, Jung Heewon looks incredibly entertained, like she's watching a particularly amusing movie. Lee Hyunsung grins at Kim Dokja supportively when their eyes meet.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Moving along... Lee Seolhwa's genial smile hasn't budged a single millimeter. In fact, she looks positively delighted by the scene in front of her, and is sporting a suspicious blush similar to Lee Jihye's. Yoo Sanga stands next to her, each of her hands shielding one of the children's eyes-- and there it is again. An amused look on her face.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja curses silently underneath his breath. What's up with all the women in his life being amused by him? They basically just see him as a mascot, at this point. Damn. Does anybody even take him seriously anymore?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja shakes his head, dejected, when a huge, bright flash of light catches his attention. When he looks closer, he realizes that it is coming from the scenario window.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The sudden explosion of indirect messages is a spectacular sight. Enough so, at least, that Kim Dokja forgets to step away from Yoo Jonghyuk and stays in their somewhat compromising position in favor of watching the screen. The light draws the attention of all the party members, who look at the overflowing screen in awe. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem, I apologize for the delay,&quot; Bihyung clears his throat. &quot;The server was a bit overloaded earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The messages and donations begin scrolling by onscreen at an unreadable speed. It's truly a beautiful sight, if Kim Dokja were to ignore the cause behind it. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; Han Sooyoung observes blankly. &quot;We're rich.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja clicks his tongue, but he also can't look away from the window. &quot;We were already rich,&quot; he replies.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we're rich.&quot; Han Sooyoung retorts.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;And to think, all we had to do this whole time was whore Kim Dokja and Yoo Jonghyuk out.&quot; Jung Heewon comments.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;This will be useful information for the future,&quot; Yoo Sanga remarks blandly.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hyung, what does 'whore' mean?&quot; Lee Gilyoung asks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja's face twitches, like it doesn't know what expression to make. He turns his head, finding that Yoo Jonghyuk has managed to return to his usual poker face. Their eyes meet without warning, and Kim Dokja abruptly springs back like he's been burned. It's a testament to how surprised Yoo Jonghyuk is that his grip on Kim Dokja falls away easily.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kim Dokja takes several steps backward until there is a respectable distance between them. And then he takes a couple more, just for good measure. His head is a mess of thoughts, hot and flustered in a way that it hasn't been since... ever, really. He doesn't understand why the Fourth Wall isn't helping him out right now.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn't what it looked like!&quot; Kim Dokja blurts without thinking, and then immediately regrets it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The company members-- specifically the women-- turn to him sharply, pouncing on the statement like sharks that smell blood in the water. &quot;Oh? It wasn't?&quot; Han Sooyoung snickers sinisterly, &quot;I don't know what the others saw, but to me it looked like you and Yoo Jonghyuk were furiously making out to the point where you completely forgot we existed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure they didn't also telepathically confess their undying love for one another while they were at it?&quot; Jung Heew</td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">&quot;Bruce please. I can't stay here anymore. Please let me go back to my apartment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim you know I can't just-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they're killing me! They're actually killing me. Jason knows I'm not allowed to leave so he's being even more annoying than usual and Dick is smothering me and won't let me work and Damian, well he actually hasn't done that much yet, but that's even more suspicious! I'm sure he's plotting something!&quot; Bruce sighed. A few weeks ago Tim had gotten into some trouble on patrol and had broken four ribs and his right leg. Alfred gave strict orders that he was to be supervised while he healed so he was currently staying at the manor. His inability to blow off steam on patrol was clearly affecting his mood and seemed to be making him more paranoid than usual. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know I'm not supposed to be alone but if I don't get away from them soon then I actually might end up killing one of them. I'm serious Bruce. I'll do it. I already have the plans drafted.&quot; The intensity in Tim's stare told Bruce that he did indeed have ideas about how to murder his brothers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tim please. I know you don't want to be here right now but it's just for a few more weeks. Can't you just put up with them for a little longer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I absolutely can not.&quot; Bruce forgot, sometimes, how serious his third son could be. He came off as sarcastic a lot of the time when in reality he's just being brutally honest. What was he supposed to do here? Tim shouldn't have to take care of himself when he's this hurt but he's clearly unhappy with the attention he's receiving at the manor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Tim said, interrupting Bruce's thoughts. &quot;What if I go to the Watchtower with you.&quot; Ah, yes. Bruce was supposed to spend the next two weeks at the Watchtower to help plan for a couple upcoming missions. It was serious business. Definitely not the place for a teenager. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll be great. I'll even help out if you need me to. I'll be the best unpaid intern the Justice League has ever had,&quot; Tim declared. &quot;I'll go pack.&quot; He grabbed his crutches and left the room before Bruce could say anything else.<br />
<br />
* * * * *<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's Batman? He's never late.&quot; Barry said, glancing around the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that's normally your thing,&quot; Hal teased, nudging his friend's foot with his own. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh haha. Seriously though, I can't be here all day. I have a pair of superpowered toddlers at home and my wife will kill me if she has to handle them by herself all day.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Batman is taking longer than usual but I'm sure he has a reason for it,&quot; Clark said, taking his seat next to Diana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or he's just slacking off,&quot; Oliver muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;When has Bruce ever slacked off on anything?&quot; Dinah sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;He- well, there's a first time for everything,&quot; Oliver decided, crossing his arms. Luckily they didn't have to wait much longer as the zeta tube powered up. The League perked up as Batman entered but immediately froze upon seeing the teenager following him. He was on crutches, wearing a red and black uniform with a domino mask to match it. He stood next to Batman, giving off the heir of professionalism that the League had only ever seen from Batman himself. The older of the pair began speaking. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is Red-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit it's you!&quot; Barry yelled, jumping out of his seat. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know this boy?&quot; Diana asked, glancing between the teen and the hero.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, he broke in a few months ago and updated our security. Batman asked us not to say anything but he's Bruce's so-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Red Robin,&quot; Bruce interrupted loudly. &quot;He'll be staying here for a while.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's nice to officially meet you all. It's an honor, really,&quot; Red Robin said with a smile. It was a strange juxtaposition, the serious, almost displeased face of Batman next to the hesitant smile of the young man beside him. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's nice to see you again,&quot; Clark said, offering a smile of his own. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you too. I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute, you broke into the Watchtower?&quot; Oliver interrupted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah?&quot; Red Robin said, sheepishly rubbing the back of his neck. &quot;Just for some security updates. Everything's been working properly, right?&quot; He scanned the faces of the Justice League before looking to Batman who gave a small nod. Red smiled again. &quot;Great. Well, I know you all have a meeting to get to so I'll make myself busy somewhere else for now. Let me know if there's anything I can do for you.&quot; He made his way to the exit, pausing before he left the room. &quot;Thanks, B.&quot; Batman nodded again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get some rest, Red.&quot; He said more gently then any of the League had heard before. Once Red Robin left Batman swept across the room, taking his seat next to Superman. &quot;Shall we begin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I- Sorry, are we just gonna pretend that didn't just happen?&quot; Oliver asked. Batman stared at him in silence. <br />
<br />
&quot;If Batman would rather not talk about it then he has a right to his privacy,&quot; J'onn said slowly. <br />
<br />
&quot;But He never talks about his personal life and how often do we get to talk to Batman's son?&quot; Hal asked incredulously. <br />
<br />
&quot;He is your child?&quot; Diana perked up, suddenly even more curious about their visitor. Bruce, for his part, seemed to be increasingly uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you only had two kids,&quot; Oliver said. <br />
<br />
&quot;You knew he had kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah. Roy is friends with them. He goes on missions with Bruce's second son, Jason, all the time. But I didn't know you had another one!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we please start the meeting? You can talk to him later if you must but it should be known that he came here to get away from his brothers and to be somewhere quiet so he can finish healing. Please don't bother him too much.&quot; The rest of the league glanced at each other before asking more questions. Bruce sighed. This meeting was not going well.<br />
<br />
* * * * *<br />
<br />
Tim had left Bruce and the League to their meeting a little over an hour ago. He had found a spot on a comfy couch in the common room and had been drifting in and out of sleep when he heard footsteps coming down the hall. He sat up and grabbed a batarang and his bow staff, and waited for the intruder to enter. As he readied himself to fight he froze when several members of the Justice League tumbled through the door. Right. He was in the Watchtower. He didn't need to worry about being attacked by league assassins and annoying brothers here. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Tim said, running a hand through his hair. &quot;How was the meeting&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Unproductive.&quot; The League jumped, not having heard Batman follow in behind them. Bruce crossed the room, sitting down next to his son. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah!&quot; Barry said, dropping into an armchair on the other side of Tim. &quot;You randomly bring one of your kids here and you expect us to be focused?&quot; Tim frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I didn't mean to be distracting, I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not your fault,&quot; Dinah said as the rest of the group settled into their seats. &quot;If anything it's Bruce's for never telling us anything about his personal life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You already know my identity, what more do you want?&quot; Bruce muttered. There was now a hint of a smile on Tim's face. <br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't google him when you found out? There's a lot out there on Brucie Wayne.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We prefer when our teammates choose to share information about themselves voluntarily,&quot; Diana explained. Tim raised an eyebrow and glanced at Bruce. <br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Oliver said, &quot;I knew about Dick and Jason, but I didn't know Bruce had three kids.&quot; Tim laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three? There are more than just three of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More? How many children does Bruce have?&quot; Diana asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Biologically, legally, or emotionally?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Tim.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's a valid question, Bruce!&quot; They spent the next minute just staring at each other, daring the other to say something else. Finally, Bruce sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just wake up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Speaking of which can I have-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I know you didn't sleep much last night and you've already had five cups today and it's barely past noon. Either survive without coffee or go back to sleep.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're a cruel man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to sleep more.&quot; Seeing that this was going to lead to an argument Oliver decided to change the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;How's Jason? Has he talked to Roy recently?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;They've been doing a lot more than just talking,&quot; Tim muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim! Please don't spread rumors about your brother's personal life,&quot; Bruce sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it really a rumor if I know it's true?&quot; Bruce gave his son a look that clearly said to stop talking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on! He deserves it after torturing me for the last four weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be spiteful Tim.&quot; The boy scoffs.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like you don't know me at all. I run on spite, coffee, and the crippling need to please everyone around me. You should be aware of this by now.&quot; Bruce pinched the bridge of his nose. Why? Why did his child have to lose all filters when he was tired? <br />
<br />
&quot;Your boys are-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're dating!?&quot; Oliver asked. He looked slightly horrified as he understood the implications of what Tim had just said and realized how close he was to learning way too much about his son's sex life. <br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't know? Well, I guess that's fair. It took B four months to realize it. World's greatest detective my ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim,&quot; Bruce interrupted once again. &quot;Let's go get you a coffee.&quot; He pulled Tim off the couch and towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you said-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I changed my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Overall, Tim's time as the Watchtower had been going well. The League members were all friendly and he had gotten a ton of work done. He had even gotten to help out with a couple league cases. The only downside was Bruce's hovering. It wasn't super obvious to those around them, but Tim was a bat. He could tell when someone was watching and listening to all of his conversations. Bruce tried to play it off as being worried about his injuries, which was partially true, but Tim deducted that he was hovering for two main reasons: A) he was worried that Tim would say something to embarrass him in front of his team or B) he was worried the League would say something to embarrass him in front of Tim. After the Jason/Roy dating reveal incident Bruce was being a lot more careful. In order to keep a more vigilant eye on him, Bruce had set up a workspace for Tim in the meeting room. It had been going well so far. Tim finished up all of his casework and was quietly following along with the Leagues presentation while filtering through some of the other private cases that the heroes had.<br />
<br />
&quot;So if we can get the Camiki to help us and distract them then the Rema won't have the time or resources for their invasion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won't work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; The League looked over to where Tim was sitting at his makeshift work desk. He pushed off the wall, sliding his chair to be beside his father. He opened his tablet, projecting the Rema file to the League. <br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get the file-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Rema value intelligence and courage. If you follow through with that plan then you'll just end up offending them and making them think we deserve to be eradicated. It would be better if--&quot; Tim paused, skimming the file again before looking at Batman. &quot;Actually, can I just handle this? It'll take like twenty minutes.&quot; Bruce looked tired but he nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please don't start any wars.&quot; Tim grinned and slid himself over to the main computer. Slipping on a headset he started trying to make contact with the Rema ship. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure this is a good idea?&quot; Clark asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Red Robin is an excellent negotiator. I'm sure he'll work something out. We can move on to the next topic.&quot; The League moved on, discussing the group of metas that were causing trouble as they slowly crossed the country. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, of course. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Please let me know if you need anything in the future. Have a safe trip home,&quot; Tim pulled his head set off and rolled his chair back over beside Bruce. &quot;What's next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're done already?&quot; Hal asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. It was pretty easy to convince them that we were worth keeping around. I drafted a trading agreement so they might contact you again in a few weeks to work out the terms of the contract, but they won't be invading.&quot; The League stared at the kid. Clark noted that Bruce looked vaguely smug and . . . proud? Is that what his proud face looks like? Most of the League members hadn't seen that look before. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what are we working on now?&quot; Tim folded his hands in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have other work to do?&quot; Bruce asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I finished all of my casework and I'm all caught up at WE. I did some of Nightwings cases too but he can stop being lazy and do the rest himself. I also looked into some of your cases. . . and the Flash's and Superman's too. . .&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I already sent my team to deal with some of the smaller ones. So basically I'm totally free.&quot; Tim looked at Bruce and paused. &quot;Unless there's something else you need me on. . .&quot; Bruce put his hand on his son's head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot; Tim pulled his tablet back out and started skimming through the meeting's agenda.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
&quot;Bart? What are you doing here?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Gramps! Tim called me. Do you know where he is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he's in the kitchen?&quot; Barry barely finished his sentence before Impulse was zipping down the hall. He followed, needing to make sure the young speedster wasn't causing trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim!&quot; Bart called as he crashed into his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Bart.&quot; Tim patted Bart's hair as Barry, Clark, and Bruce watched in confusion. What was Bart doing here? How did he even get in? Bart grinned as he pulled back from the hug. <br />
<br />
&quot;I come bearing gifts!&quot; He sat down, practically vibrating in his seat as he pulled a variety of treats from his bag and set down a cup of coffee in front of Tim. &quot;It's from that place in Costa Rica that you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See, this is why you're my favorite,&quot; Tim said, taking a sip from the to-go cup. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tim, what is he doing here?&quot; Bruce finally asked. Barry crossed the room taking a seat next to Clark, further down the table from the two boys. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm helping Tim with a mission! He's been giving me a lot of really helpful information lately so it's the least I can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Rema mentioned that there's gonna be some new tech released a few solar systems over in a couple weeks so we have to plan our trip.&quot; Barry's eyes widened. Oh, that could not go well. Tim had clearly established himself as a genius and a great leader and Bart, well, Bart had literally built his own time machine to come save his grandfather's life and stop an impending apocalypse. Those two mixed with alien tech? Yeah, probably not something that their guardians would be able to deal with.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're. . . leaving the solar system?&quot; Clark asked. &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bart has a ship,&quot; Tim said simply as his friend nods. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you get a spaceship!?&quot; How had Barry not realized that one of the kids in his care had a freaking space vessel?<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim, you can't go to space.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I can't knowingly send my seventeen year old into space with his friends unsupervised,&quot; Bruce said, rubbing his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm emancipated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to stop using that as an excuse every time I say something you don't like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's emancipated?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I- I was lost in time. There was nothing I could do,&quot; Bruce sighed. &quot;It was for business purposes anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cassie is eighteen now. She'll be our adult supervision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus Kon will be there,&quot; Bart jumped in. &quot;He's our official Mom friend so he won't let anything too bad happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that we expect anything bad to happen. This is strictly a shopping/trading trip. No missions, no fighting unless necessary. I promise.&quot; Barry and Clark glanced at each other while Bruce starred as his son. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not so sure-&quot; Clark started.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't go!&quot; Barry said, looking slightly panicked. &quot;Batman, tell them they can't go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will check in twice a day,&quot; Bruce finally announced. <br />
<br />
&quot;What!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can agree to that,&quot; Tim nodded. &quot;But you can't trail us.&quot; Batman nodded and shook Tim's hand. Tim then stood, grabbing his crutches. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Bart, we can plan this in my room.&quot; The heroes watched as the boys left the room, chatting happily about their upcoming trip. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're letting our children go to space,&quot; Barry said in disbelief, still watching the now empty doorway. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it wouldn't be the first time they went. At least they'll be checking in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean it's not the first time!?&quot;<br />
<br />
* * * * *<br />
<br />
The two weeks of work that the League had done had gone well. Many of the members were surprised at how much work had gotten done (no doubt in part thanks to Tim). Tomorrow the team would be returning to their regular schedules where they didn't have to spend so much at the tower. They were in the meeting room listening to Batman's report on the previous weeks when the tower's communicator started beeping. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's from the cave, B,&quot; Tim said. Bruce sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead and answer it.&quot; On the screen appeared a young man dressed in all black except for the bright blue bird across his chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;B! Hi, how are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm busy right now Dick. What do you need?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you're no fun,&quot; the man, Dick, pouted. &quot;When are you and Timmy coming back?&quot; Tim sighed. How many times did he have to tell Dick to stop calling him that? <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not really? Damian pissed off Babs and she said she's not helping us anymore until he apologies, but we both know how likely that is.&quot; Dick rolled his eyes. &quot;I could use some help with that before he ends up doing something even more stupid than antagonizing the person who knows literally everything about this city.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Move, Grayson!&quot; A young face filled the screen. &quot;Father! I find it unacceptable that Drake has gotten to spend this much time in the Watchtower. I am the blood son. If anyone should be there it should be me-&quot; He was cut off by a hand pushing his face out of the way and an older boy taking his place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim! I know you like to take my clothes but did you really have to bring all of my sweatshirts with you? It's fucking cold in the cave, man, I need those.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dick,&quot; Bruce interrupted. The League watched as the first man came back on screen. &quot;We'll be home tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome-&quot; he was cut off by a loud crash followed by an &quot;I WILL KILL YOU TODD!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Dick said, wincing. &quot;I've gotta go. I'll see you guys tomorrow.&quot; The video shut off and the League was left staring at Batman who looked ten times more tired than he did before answering the call. <br />
<br />
&quot;And you tried to force me to stay with them for two more weeks.&quot;</td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">But the man only cocked his head to the side, hairless eyebrows quirking. With his face closer to the light, Peter made out more details, like the scars that draped themselves over the man's body, less like he was wearing them and more like they were wearing him. When Peter inhaled, the stench of pain made his nose sting and his eyes water, overwhelming in its magnitude. The man's eyes are hard and angry when they meet Peters'. <br />
<br />
This wasn't the worst situation he's been in. <br />
<br />
It was still pretty bad all things considered, but they weren't shooting at him anymore and that felt like a solid step in the right direction. <br />
<br />
The dozen or so guys pinning him to the floor was a bit uncomfortable though. One of them had his arm bent at a particularly painful angle, their knees pressed down on his legs, and his mouth was bitter with the tang of blood after getting socked in the jaw earlier. He's been in tighter pickles for sure, but he wasn't having a good time either. <br />
<br />
Still, all things considered, he was doing a decent job. <br />
<br />
A muddied boot stopped inches from his nose, smelling of fish and muck, and Peter wrinkled his nose. <br />
<br />
&quot;How pleasant,&quot; he said, and then winced as more pressure was added on his back. <br />
<br />
The boot shifted as the body it belonged to crouched and grabbed Peter's jaw, looking him from side to side. Her fingerless gloves dug into the material of his mask, pinching it between her fingers, and Peter snapped his head away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, no touchie! I have no idea where those hands have been.&quot; <br />
<br />
She dropped her hands between her crouched legs. &quot;It's about time we got you.&quot; Her tone has a bland lilt that brings Peter all the way back to high school, cornered by Flash Thompson in between classes, hating his life while Flash asks if he wants to step into the locker himself or if he'd prefer to be helped inside. <br />
<br />
She reminds him of Flash too, in a thuggish way. Less give-me-your-lunch-money  and more  empty-your-wallet-and-I-may-not-hurt-you-as-much  . She has the same square jaw, a bundle of dark hair tied in a loose bun, and a scowl that would've made  Kraven turn tail and run. Peter squinted at her as best he could with his face being smooshed into the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, lady, I don't know who you schmucks are, but knabbing people off the streets is very impolite where I'm from.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Another joker,&quot; she sighed, standing back up and brushing off her pants, like Peter might've left icky spider germs on her. &quot;The boss is gonna love that.&quot; And, without warning, she kicked him in the face. <br />
<br />
Peter's head snapped to the side as copper flooded his mouth again. Any harder and she might've broken his jaw. If he wasn't as super-powered as he was, she very well might have. He groaned, loud and annoyed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Way to kick a guy while he's down. What happened to after-fight formalities? Didn't even give me a chance to...to, uh...fellas?&quot; <br />
<br />
The woman had gone suspiciously still. So had the guys pinning him. Peter stopped rolling his jaw, looking between them. Had he struck a nerve? Were after-fight formalities an actual thing? <br />
<br />
The woman crouched again, bunching her fingers into the front of his suit, and pulled him up (goons and all) to smell along the crook of his neck, Peter recoiled in surprise. <br />
<br />
&quot;Omega?&quot; she said, pulling away. &quot;You're an omega?&quot; <br />
<br />
The calm Peter had been holding onto so tightly slipped between his fingers. He licked the blood from his lips, muscles coiling as a new look manifested in her eyes. The goons holding him felt more like pieces of plywood than people, their bodies going rigid as Peter's scent hit their noses. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he said and attempted to do jazz hands behind his back. &quot;Surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
He could smell the alpha coming off every goon in the warehouse, especially from her. She reeked of a superiority complex, it was no surprise she was leading this little rag-tag team. But if they could smell him that meant the scent-blockers sewn into his suit were broken. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Damn.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Regret for turning down Tony's offer of installing Stark-patented scent blockers in his suit made his tongue sour. Most superheroes--and villains--had scent-blockers woven into their costumes, and given that most of the superhero community was enhanced, their second gender came off a bit stronger than your average Joe. Scent blockers were a precaution they all favored. <br />
<br />
Tony's blockers were, admittedly, amazing. The slap those babies on and you wouldn't get a wiff out of em' for months  kind of amazing. But Peter was something of a scientist himself, and he had his own designs that he was perfecting. Which had broken. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Double damn.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Tony wasn't going to let him hear the end of this. <br />
<br />
The woman leaned down once more and smelled along his neck as if to double-check, before shoving his face back against the cement. Ow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe this will be easier than I thought,&quot; she chuckled. &quot;I thought we were chasing an alpha.&quot; <br />
<br />
And just like that, Peter's anxiety melted into a glop of irritation. There was the cocky alpha behavior he loved to hate. What was this, the Middle Ages? Did he miss the memo that it was still the 1800s and not the 21st century? Watch, she's going to use her &quot;alpha voice&quot; on him. <br />
<br />
This was always so embarrassing to watch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stand down, omega,&quot; she growled near his ear, low, dark, and full of command. <br />
<br />
Peter heaved a heavy sigh. &quot;Oh, wow. Gee. Not the alpha voice. Please stop, how will I function like a human being now? Oh no, woe is me.&quot; <br />
<br />
She balked, recoiling as if Peter had slapped her with her own moldy boot. &quot;I said to  listen , omega.&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter cringed. He hated it when alphas tried making him listen like that. Was it too hard to act like a normal person? He responded well to &quot;Oh hey, could I have your attention for a sec?&quot; and &quot;Could I have a moment of your time, please?&quot; <br />
<br />
It was unbelievable that the stigma that alphas could control omegas had stuck for so long, they were supposed to be evolving as a species. <br />
<br />
&quot;How about no?&quot; Peter retorted, adjusting his arms. The goons had lightened their grip, which was great? Why should they exert themselves 100% on an omega, after all? &quot;And please stop with the voice. I don't know if you can hear yourself, but it's  so bad. Like, wow, I'm embarrassed for you right now.&quot; <br />
<br />
The woman stood back up. Her pheromones stung his nose with things like  listen, obey,  and  submit  , but all he could project was  stop, this is painful to watch,  and  uuugggghhh.  <br />
<br />
Her face twisted curiously. &quot;It doesn't work on you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter arched an eyebrow. &quot;It doesn't work on anyone. Do you honestly think it does? Just gonna growl and I'll roll over? Someone obviously didn't take Secondary-Gender Studies in college.&quot; <br />
<br />
Her scowl returned, as dark and rocky as before, and she looked him up and down one last time, hand on her chin. &quot;Bring him.&quot; <br />
<br />
Grappling hands began pulling him up and Peter took a deep breath. Break time is over, time to get back to work. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope!&quot; He wrenched his arms out of their grips with laughable ease. Whirling around, he kicked the first chump he saw, punched the second, and threw the third. <br />
<br />
If he'd known this stake-out was going to turn on him like this, he would've stayed home and gorged himself on the last of his ramen. But, he'd been too eager after snagging a lead on these guys and hadn't taken the necessary precautions. Like an idiot. <br />
<br />
He'd been tailing this woman and her merry band of thugs for weeks now, only after connecting them to a string of random kidnappings plaguing the streets of his city. Most of the kidnappings were homeless, some had been criminals, and a small percentage were random civilians. The homeless didn't deserve that--they had it rough as it was--criminals really didn't need to go somewhere where they were going to be either a) recruited, or b) tortured and experimented on. And civilians? They just needed to go home. Nobody deserves to be snatched away from their life like that. <br />
<br />
What he hadn't been expecting was for the kidnappers to turn around and start hunting  him.  He was definitely relearning the  come-up-with-a-plan-that-isn't-pulled-out-of-your-ass  lesson that he's been struggling to wrap his head around for years now. <br />
<br />
The goons shook themselves out of their surprise and rushed him, teeth-bared, projecting excessive amounts of aggressive pheromones they thought were going to make him drop and surrender. Now he just really needed to sneeze. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yoink!&quot; he jeered, snatching a gun out of an alpha's hand and hitting two others with it when they tried to grab him from behind. &quot;Easy, easy. Single file. Let's not crowd Spidey now. There's more than enough of me to go around-- hey!  Don't take that perverted! I saw that look.&quot; <br />
<br />
Webbing two goons together, he swung them into the rest of the group and knocked them down like a bowling ball to pins. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;STEE-RIKE!&quot;  He shouted, pumping his fist. &quot;All those bowling nights actually paid off, who'da thunk?&quot; <br />
<br />
His spider-sense poked insistently at his brain to stop fooling around and he turned, easily catching the punch aimed at his head. The woman bared her teeth, annoyance souring her scent, and grabbed his wrist with her other hand. She twisted it until he was forced to let go, and continued squeezing it like she intended to pop it right off its joint. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ow, ow,  ow, ow,&quot;  he yanked himself free. &quot;Jeez.&quot; He shook his hands, attempting to fling the pain off. &quot;Someone forgot to mention they have super strength.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Back to the plan,&quot; she yelled to her team, keeping her eyes on him as she bracketed her arms and legs as if to catch him. <br />
<br />
Not going to happen. Lure him into a shady warehouse and jump him once, shame on him. Keep him in the shady warehouse and try to jump him again, shame on them. He hasn't exactly been Brainy McSmarty-Pants today, but he wasn't that stupid. <br />
<br />
He could handle this. Easy peasy. <br />
<br />
The woman lunged, arms out, a growl bubbling in her throat, and Peter blocked the first two punches before adding a few swings of his own, but it was getting hard to focus with so many different people spooking his spider-sense. The woman was, by far, the biggest threat, but he didn't like the idea of a gun aimed at his back either. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ready,&quot; a voice said behind him and Peter barely blocked the kick to his abdomen when his spider-sense buzzed sharply. The woman used the momentum of her kick to whirl around and land a solid hit to his chest that pushed the air out of his lungs and made him stagger. Without wasting a second, she lunged again, clocked him in the face, followed by another roundhouse kick, and he hit the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now!&quot; She yelled and something smacked him in the face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, aim a little!&quot; He snapped and looked down at the canister teetering back and forth next to his arm. He only just recognized it before it spewed gas into his face and he staggered to his feet, coughing and fanning the air around him. Within the milky fog, the woman's fist connected to his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Again,&quot; she ordered and another canister landed at Peter's feet. <br />
<br />
Peter backed up, white wisps swirling around his legs and rising higher. Whatever this drug was it worked fast, his head was already spinning, with one hand pressed against his forehead to stem off the disorientation, the other found a wall and he braced himself against it. <br />
<br />
More clinks littered the floor and the fog got thicker. Another wave of dizziness inundated Peter and he had to pat the wall a few times to make sure it was solid before weakly beginning to climb. The world spun and a rotten simmer of nausea bubbled in his belly, one punch away from throwing up. <br />
<br />
He got a few feet up the wall before a hand grasped his ankle and yanked him down. His fingers shook as he slid down the wall. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not so fast, omega,&quot; the woman laughed, voice muffled behind a gas mask she'd acquired from one of her goons. &quot;You're not escaping that easy.&quot; <br />
<br />
He kicked her in the face. <br />
<br />
Which both greatly amused him and made sickness roll in his gut. He leaned his head against the wall, groaning, and lifted a shaky wrist to the rafters. He meant to trigger his webshooters and pull himself to safety, but his arm dropped heavily by his side, feeling as though it'd been pumped full of iron. It was probably not normal that his skin was going numb. <br />
<br />
Two hands grabbed him by the waist and attempted to pry him from the wall. Peter, becoming more like a stubborn cat clinging to carpet, kept his fingertips and toes planted firmly against the brick for as long as possible until, with a final rough tug and an unsportsmanlike cuff to the head, he let go. Despite collapsing on the floor, he pushed his assailant away from him, hard enough to send them flying back. It must've been one of the goons judging by the throaty &quot;AHHHHH!&quot; that came from their mask. Peter tried to get to his feet, but the world spun under him, and he only made it to his knees. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, come on, come on,&quot;  he chanted, shaking himself. &quot;Time to go, Spidey.&quot; <br />
<br />
His spider-sense lazily probed him this time and he more watched the incoming fist than tried to dodge it. When it connected, he was sure he blacked out for a minute because when he opened his eyes, he was back on the floor and the woman was on top of him, pinning his arms to his back. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're feisty,&quot; she said and he could  hear her grin, &quot;and a bastard to take down. The boss is gonna love you.&quot; She pushed something sharp and pointy into the juncture of his neck and Peter jerked away in panic. She laughed, hopping off and backing up a distance. <br />
<br />
Peter forced himself to his feet but wobbled, knees bending as if she'd injected jelly into his legs while he was unconscious. <br />
<br />
&quot;What'd you-&quot; he slurred but didn't finish as his legs gave out from under him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight, omega,&quot; she said, voice sounding far away. She nudged his head with the toe of her boot. &quot;See you when you wake up.&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter wanted to say something intelligent back, like &quot;Nuh-uh,&quot; but he was already unconscious. <br />
<br />
So, this situation was worse than he thought. <br />
<br />
That's on him. <br />
<br />
He took full responsibility for getting jumped and he should've known better. He's sorry. <br />
<br />
But as bad as everything was, the gurney he was strapped to was pretty comfy as far as gurney's went. Well, there was one wheel that squeaked as they moved and it roused him from unconsciousness with the likeness of being jabbed in the ear with a sharp stick. But otherwise, not bad. <br />
<br />
His mask was gone and that should've been enough to spark an imminent meltdown, but his head hurt like hell and he could hardly muster a thought, much less a panic attack. He squinted through the slits of his eyes, cringing from the lights passing above him. They weren't especially bright, but it still felt like a dozen needles gouging into his retinas. <br />
<br />
They rolled over a bump and he groaned, swallowing back bile. There were better ways to die than choking on his own vomit, like passing peacefully, gorged on pizza on a mattress that didn't have bed bugs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where'r tak'n me?&quot; Peter slurred at nobody in particular and was wholly surprised when the woman from earlier appeared in his line of sight. She didn't say anything, just glared down at him, validating that he was awake before disappearing again. But he could still smell her. She reeked of  content, smug,  and  victorious.  <br />
<br />
In fact, this whole place reeked. The scents varied from excited, curious,  and  amused  to  scared, hurt,  and  help me.  He couldn't pinpoint where they came from. It was everywhere, consuming and overwhelming and it pulled him farther out of his daze. <br />
<br />
&quot;This can't be good,&quot; he muttered as they turned into a room. It was a yucky-looking room, with low-budget lights and props that belonged on the stage of a crappy, ill-thought-out sci-fi movie set. He craned his neck to get a look at the man standing in the middle of the room, whose hands were clasped behind his back. He was wearing a lab coat, which definitely wasn't a good sign. <br />
<br />
This man wasn't an alpha. His scent was pure beta. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, here we are,&quot; the man greeted them. Peter would've liked his accent if it didn't scream 'conceited asshole.' &quot;I was wondering where you were.&quot; He looked down at Peter crossly, like it was his fault it took so long. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sorry, got caught up talking to your lapdog here,&quot; Peter smiled fleetingly at the woman. &quot;She's so nice, and handled me  so gently.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Another talker,&quot; the man sighed. &quot;Lovely.&quot; <br />
<br />
The woman shrugged, chewing on a matchstick with boredom. &quot;Couldn't get him to shut up no matter how many times I hit him.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man walked around the table, examining Peter from all sides, with his chin in his fingers. &quot;Nothing we can't fix,&quot; he said and bent down, sniffing along Peter's neck. &quot;An omega, then? What's an omega like you doing in the streets dressed like that?&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter shrugged. &quot;Oh, you know, kicking ass. Taking names. Doing what I do.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; the man said, rolling his eyes. &quot;Anything else you'd like to add, Angel?&quot; he asked the woman. <br />
<br />
Peter gaped.  &quot;Angel? That's her name? And who are you? Mr. Nice Guy?&quot; Mr. Nice Guy stared blandly and Peter winced. &quot;Yeah, okay, that one was bad. Sorry, the quips will get better as soon as I stop seeing double.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mr. Nice Guy sighed, tugging on his mad-scientist gloves. &quot;You remind me of someone else. Guy couldn't stop talking either. Considered sewing his mouth shut at one point, but who has the time?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I'm sure your uber-evil mad scientist agenda is book, so just show me the door and I'll happily get out of your hair.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no,&quot; Mr. Nice Guy wagged his finger at Peter, smiling in the way one would at a child who was being silly. &quot;I've been watching you for a while, Spider-Man. That's an impressive set of powers you've got. Good stamina and a high tolerance for pain.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;I'll admit you threw me off by being omega, but I guess that makes dealing with you easier in the long run.&quot; <br />
<br />
That again? Peter lifted his head for the sole reason to glare. <br />
<br />
&quot;And what the hell is  that supposed to mean?&quot; He demanded. <br />
<br />
Mr. Nice Guy tussled Peter's hair. &quot;Don't you worry about that.&quot; He gestured for Angel to go. &quot;That'll be all. I'll call if I need anything.&quot; <br />
<br />
Angel shrugged, twirling the matchstick in her mouth as she got up from the wall she was leaning against. &quot;Give em' hell, Ajax,&quot; she said over her shoulder. <br />
<br />
Peter gawked, mouthing stretching into a wide, incredulous grin,  &quot;Ajax? You're named after a cleaner? Oh, man, your parents must've hated you. That, or they had a serious boner for Mr. Clean.&quot; <br />
<br />
He must've broached a sensitive topic because suddenly Ajax was looming over him, face tight and unsmiling. He had a look that rivaled Peter's landlord on rent day, and he didn't say that lightly. Peter was 80% positive his landlord was a monster from a 1900's horror film. Like, he looked funny enough, but he was so horribly animated that it left you somewhat terrified. <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Ajax,&quot; Mr. Nice Guy sneered. &quot;Drop it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright, dropping it as fast as your mother dropped you on your head as a baby.&quot; <br />
<br />
The resulting blow was harsh and angry, but Peter's felt worse. Ajax grabbed a fistful of Peter's hair and yanked his head upward. &quot;Piss me off, omega, and I'll make your life more of a shit show than it's about to be.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Tough words,&quot; Peter whispered back. &quot;My life's been a shit show for the last few years.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ajax slammed his head against the table and Peter's vision swam. He was pretty sure he was already concussed from his fight with  Ms. Woman-Who-Definitely-Doesn't-Act-Like-A-Holy-Entity,  and his head trauma was only getting worse from there. A part of Peter was telling him not to piss off the guy who was--likely--going to enact terrible experiments on him. But the other part was still very offended about the  &quot;if he be omega, he be easy to handle&quot;  bit and he didn't want to give this asshat the luxury of an easy time. <br />
<br />
Ajax backed up, observing Peter again. His lips were pinched in irritation like he was tasting something sour, but he cocked his head, intrigued. Peter glared back, daring him to try anything. If he even tried to make Peter &quot;submit,&quot; Peter was busting kneecaps. <br />
<br />
Submit. He's so fucking sick of that word, especially from losers named after bathroom cleaners. It's already been forced on him ever since he presented as omega, at 14-fucking-years old, he didn't need it while he was being tortured too. <br />
<br />
A moment passed and Ajax relaxed, smiling. Whoa--major red flag. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like you don't know your place,&quot; he mused, chin in hand again. &quot;I think I know how to fix that. What any hot-tempered omega needs is a good, strong, dominant alpha to calm them down. Keep them in line.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Peter all but screeched. &quot;I'll break any fucking alpha you have! Hot-tempered, my ass! I'm gonna beat the shit out of them, and then you, and then Angel!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Ajax murmured, more to himself than Peter. &quot;Definitely in need of a calming goat. For both of you, I'd say. I know just the alpha to match you with.&quot; His smile grew, becoming more sinister, and Peter knew when an evil plot was being hatched. <br />
<br />
He squirmed on the gurney. &quot;Stop it! No! Whatever you're thinking, stop it now.&quot; Aunt May and MJ meddled in his love life enough, he didn't need a crazy scientist playing sadistic Cupid too. <br />
<br />
Ajax spun on his heels and popped his head out of the door, called someone in, and returned to Peter's side with a gaggle of alphas who wasted no time looking at Peter like he was a treat on a dessert table. His dislike for this place intensified by a million. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bind him and put him in Cell Block 10,&quot; Ajax ordered. &quot;Treat with caution. Omega or not, he's still a mutate.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This pretty lil thing,&quot; one alpha cooed, stroking Peter's cheek. &quot;C'mon boss, he looks like he couldn't hurt a fly.&quot; <br />
<br />
Oh, unintentional pun. Peter might've appraised it under different circumstances. He's debating on whether or not he should bite the guy's finger off and risk rabies when Ajax shoves the alpha harshly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want him smelling purely of omega,&quot; he seethed, baring his teeth. &quot;You go rubbing your scent on him and I'll leave you in Cell Block 10 instead. How does that sound?&quot; <br />
<br />
The guy paled and he stepped several feet away from Peter like he might catch a disease. &quot;I hear ya, I hear ya,&quot; he said, looking a little green. &quot;Pure omega. Got it, boss.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Before you take him,&quot; Ajax left and returned with a bottle and syringe. He inserted the needle into the bottle, slurping up a decent amount of the concoction inside. &quot;I think we'd better take precautions for now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter tried to pull away as Ajax hovered the needlepoint over the crook of his arm, but one of the goons grabbed him, keeping him still. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cheapskate,&quot; Peter snapped once Ajax withdrew, syringe empty. This is why needles get such a bad rep. He's had too many nutjobs stick em' in him to be comfortable. <br />
<br />
&quot;Take him,&quot; Ajax said, tossing the syringe in the trash and pulling off his gloves. <br />
<br />
The goons began unbuckling Peter and as soon as he was free, he'd knock the first one out and make a break for the exit. Didn't really know where the exit was, but he'd improvise. As soon as he was out, he'd memorize the location and book it; bring back the Avengers, or even SHIELD depending on how cooperative they were feeling. This place would get shut down. Easy peasy. <br />
<br />
Only, Peter was feeling very...very...fuzzy...<br />
<br />
Was he sedated? Or did Ajax simply stuff his head full of cotton when he wasn't looking? The buckles pinning his arms fell away and Peter jolted upward. Or he tried to. It felt more like sitting up really slowly, swaying, as he waited for the world to stop whirlpooling. He barely noticed when hands heaved him to his feet, off the gurney, and he swayed more. A rumble of laughter flitted around him when he had to lean against the gurney for stability. <br />
<br />
The smell of amused alphas burned his nose. <br />
<br />
Embarrassment mucked his disorientation and he straightened up. What was in that stuff? His head felt full of helium and he was pretty sure he had iron bolts screwed into his fingertips. His confusion must've shown because Ajax laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;A helluva sedative, huh? Made it myself. Won't be kicking ass or taking names with that ravaging your system.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Bastard,&quot; Peter said, trying to glare at him, but the room was spinning and ooohh shit  he was definitely going to throw up. Before he's given the opportunity, he's seized again and led out the door. <br />
<br />
Stumbling, he tried making sense of the bright lights and fuzzy walls. Blotched and blurry figures swam in and out of view, making him blink rapidly to keep up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Told you this would be easy,&quot; one goon said. &quot;Bet we could've handled him without the sedative.&quot; <br />
<br />
Another round of chuckles and mumbled agreement. <br />
<br />
That rerouted Peter's brain. Yeah, this was too easy.  What the hell, Parker?  What happened to breaking every alpha Francis threw at him? He put so much effort into challenging Ajax's stupid traditional views, he wasn't about to be alpha-handled into a cell with nary a fight. Not with his pride at stake. <br />
<br />
He felt his way up his shirt, using it as a guide to one of the hands clamped over his bicep, and curled his fingers around their wrist. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; they said in surprise. <br />
<br />
Peter squeezed. Maybe a bit too hard if the resounding  SNAP and howl of pain was any indication. He used their surprise to lean back into them, grab their forearm, bend over, and throw the jackass over his shoulder. It takes only a second, as simple as breathing, but the sudden motion overwhelms him with nausea and he stumbles, barely stopping himself from hurling all over the floor. <br />
<br />
Thankfully, the rest of the goons were just as surprised and didn't attack right away, just stared at their howling friend with wide, frantic eyes. Peter took a deep breath and grabbed for the next one, snatching empty air at first before snagging her jacket and tossing her into one of her friends, and then went for the next one. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, by then, the rest of them had snapped out of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;You little bitch!&quot; one growled, pulling out his gun. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ajax wants him alive,&quot; another chides her comrade, forcing the gun back down. &quot;Hurt him and you can take his place in Cell 10.&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter wanted to snidely say that he would have dodged it anyway, but was too busy stumbling into a wall to get the words out. Shaking himself, he pushed off the wall and stumbled right into an awaiting fist that snapped his head to the side. Groaning, he hit the wall again. <br />
<br />
His spider-sense was a lazy drunk loitering in his skull, but he still managed to dodge the next attack and kick the offender away. He wasn't so lucky the second time. His punch was stopped and his arm bent behind his back, the position forced his face into the wall, which only made his headache worse, before he was lifted and slammed into the ground. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;That's when he threw up. <br />
<br />
There wasn't much in his stomach, so he was left dry heaving for the most part. He's still choking as he's grabbed by the back of his neck and roughly led down the hall. More than one pair of hands are braced on him now, clamped like steel braces on his arms and back. Residue vomit lingered on his tongue and the back of his throat, and he almost threw up again. It stained the front of the cheap gray shirt they'd dressed him in and he wanted to be disgusted but felt like too much shit to care at this point. <br />
<br />
They stopped in front of a door with a clearly written CELL BLOCK X above the metal frame and he was suddenly shaken with apprehension. They all talked about Cell 10 like it had the devil itself inside, enough so that it intimidated the alpha's into behaving. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait--&quot; Peter slurred, digging his heels into the ground. &quot;Don't-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Too late, omega,&quot; a goon hissed in his ear and rammed her gun into his back. He stumbled inside and immediately whirled around, kicking out with his leg, but all it hits is a locked door that dents under his foot but doesn't budge. <br />
<br />
Dammit. <br />
<br />
He dropped his foot and stumbled onto the floor, panting. His head was pounding like a child banging a drumstick against his brain. He groaned throatily and slumped the rest of the way to the floor, resting his head against the cool cement. <br />
<br />
It took a minute, and a cough to his left, to realize he wasn't alone. <br />
<br />
There's a man sitting in the corner of the room, half cast in shadow. Peter's vision was still mottled, but he can make out gray pants similar to his own. His roomie was wearing a white shirt though, the sleeves twisted strangely, decorated with buttons and straps. It took several more blinks to realize that's because it was a straitjacket. <br />
<br />
That is  never a good sign. <br />
<br />
Peter jumped to his feet, almost threw up, and plastered himself to the wall, slowly easing down into a crouch. Sweat sticks to his clothes, making them chafe uncomfortably, and he has the worst migraine, but he'd take this bastard down in a heartbeat anyway. <br />
<br />
But the man only cocked his head to the side, hairless eyebrows quirking. With his face closer to the light, Peter made out more details, like the scars that draped themselves over the man's body, less like he was wearing them and more like they were wearing  him.  When Peter inhaled, the stench of pain made his nose sting and his eyes water, overwhelming in its magnitude. The man's eyes are hard and angry when they meet Peters'. <br />
<br />
&quot;And who are you supposed to be? They actually giving me roommates again? Nice try, Francie!&quot; this the man yelled at the door, &quot;but I'm not buying it! Give im' to someone else.&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter recoiled. &quot;S'cuse you,&quot; he snapped, but it was loose and watery on his tongue. &quot;I'm not  given to anyone. I don't want to be here just as much as you, pal.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man huffed, just shy of a sneer. &quot;Doubtful. I've been here for quite a while. You could say I'm in the senior class of the facility. It sucks more ass than you think, newbie, take it from your upperclassmen.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I deduced that myself, thanks,&quot; Peter said, slowly sliding into the corner farthest from the man and nestling into it, legs pulled to his chest. He gave the cell a once-over. &quot;What is this place, anyway? I didn't get the Freshmen Orientation.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This,&quot; the man's body opened as if he were trying to spread his arms, wearing a painfully large smile that's too wild to be real, &quot;is Weapon X, the go-to-hell for those looking for a little more  oomph in their already shitty lives. A muties one-stop destination for death, mental instability, and pain. Whoooop-de-dooo for us!&quot; He slumped against the wall, thumping his head hard against it. <br />
<br />
Peter winced. His roommate is crazy. Probably right, but crazy. Good to know. He leaned his head back against the wall too and clamped his eyes shut, fighting off another bout of nausea. <br />
<br />
&quot;Francis's sedative?&quot; the man asked after a moment. &quot;Yeah, it's a little bitch, ain't it? Doesn't work on me for very long, but it puts you through a tizzy, huh.&quot; His eyes flitted to the mess down the front of Peter's shirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, you're not making it any better,&quot; Peter growled, rubbing his temples and trying dutifully to ignore the pungent odor coming off his clothes. <br />
<br />
The man laughed. &quot;Probably not. Don't worry, it'll run its course soon enough.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Says the guy who said it doesn't affect him as much,&quot; Peter said, rubbing his temples harder. &quot;Thanks, but in this case, I don't think our systems are quite on par.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man shrugged. &quot;A healing factor will do that.&quot; <br />
<br />
He stayed silent until Peter unraveled his pinched expression and took a deep breath. <br />
<br />
&quot;Feeling better yet?&quot; He asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Think so,&quot; Peter said, switching to massaging his forehead. &quot;What the hell does he put in that, anyway?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Probably the tears of puppies and the blood of orphans.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sounds about right. Been a while since I've tasted puppy tears.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's the orphan blood that really gives it that  kick.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Peter snorted, not quite ready to be amused, but it eased the tension in his shoulders. &quot;Delicious.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man shifted position so he was sitting upright against the wall. His eyes were hooked on Peter, like fish lines digging into his skin. It didn't take a strong nose to smell the clearly evident alpha coming off him. He could probably smell Peter too. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, why's ol Francie putting omega's in my cell?&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter quirked an eyebrow at him, all but shouting with his expression  'Why do you think?'  Out loud he said, &quot;Beats me. Said something about a calming goat, but I don't know who's calming who in this scenario.&quot; <br />
<br />
Wade rolled his eyes and leaned his head back, looking at the ceiling. &quot;Yeah, that sounds like him. What a douche.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A total jackass.&quot; <br />
<br />
After a long pause, Peter grumbled sourly under his breath, &quot;Well, I ain't playing the calming goat, nor will I be calm,&quot; he got to his feet. The effects of the sedative were wearing off, and he was </td>

<br />
&quot;Bad News, they'll be here in six hours,&quot; Wonder Woman said, looking over the combined forces of the Justice League and Young Justice, &quot;this species of alien is known as the Klognines, and are extremely vicious. All peace talks have failed so far, and they are headed straight for earth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good news,&quot; Superman piped up, &quot;They're force is relatively small. No need to bring in earthen governments.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad news,&quot; Wonderwoman said, &quot;we don't have enough people to deal with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good news,&quot; Superman said, stepping in front of Wonder Woman, &quot;we have enough time to gather auxiliary forces. So call in every favor you have. Every hero you know of. We're going to save the earth!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a long moment of quiet as people muttered to each other about who they could call. No one saw Wonder Woman and Superman stare down Batman, who glared and strolled out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Robin whispered to Nightwing, &quot;this'll be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
A few hours later, plans were in motion. Batman had coordinated several transmissions to other heroes not affiliated with any teams, but hope was dwindling. There weren't many people who knew others, and those who did know others weren't even sure they would come.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't going to work,&quot; Connor said over the mindlink to M'gann. &quot;We don't have enough people.&quot;<br />
<br />
M'gann pursed her lips. &quot;More people are coming, Batman said so. And we've got a bunch more than usual. Will somehow got Cheshire to make it, so there's at least some hope, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor frowned. &quot;One miracule doesn't equal many.&quot;<br />
<br />
M'gann laughed and touched his arm. &quot;We'll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
As if on cue, the zeta beams began to whir, and the computer's voice sounded over the muffled discussions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Recognised, Arsenal: B-25. Unrecogised, D-01. Override: Batman 02. Unrecogised, D-02. Override: Batman 02.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone perked up at the sound of Roy's designation, as well as two more new allies. Interest was strengthened at the sight of them.<br />
<br />
Arsenal stood to the left of the trio, looking for all the world as if this were business as usual.<br />
<br />
In the center was a man in gray cargo pants. He had two thigh holsters which held handguns. A leather jacket over gray armor which had a red ... bat on it? The strangest thing about him though, was the red helmet he wore. It covered his entire head, and had no facial features whatsoever beyond two cold white eyes.<br />
<br />
On the other side was a woman just as, if not more, strange. She wore a purple and silver costume that looked like a heavily armored sleeveless leotard with a high neckline. It held a green gem at the top of her chest. Her gloves were of the same color pallet, as well as her boots. Both were long, the former coming up to her sizable biceps, and the latter being thigh-high. Her hair was long, and mostly red. But it faded to orange and then to yellow near the bottom. She wore no mask, so her unnaturally bright and solid green eyes were prominent. Her skin was also a light shade of orange.<br />
<br />
Arsenal stepped down first, quickly followed by the woman. The latter hovering a few inches off the ground. The other man paused for a moment, letting out an audible sigh and crossing his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;ROY!&quot; Dick called rushing in. &quot;KORY! You guys came!&quot;He stopped right in front of the pair, giving each one a hug. It was quite surprising for most of the newer - and some of the more experienced members. Nightwing was usually more reserved.<br />
<br />
The second man walked down as Nightwing finished giving the woman a hug. He froze, however, when his companions stepped aside, and Nightwing turned his attention to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Little Wing,&quot; he said, opening his arms wide. &quot;Come give me a hug, I haven't seen you in months!&quot;<br />
<br />
The man - Little Wing? That couldn't be his hero moniker, could it? - immediately drew both of his hand guns, and pointed them directly at Nightwing's chest. Nightwing froze.<br />
<br />
Everyone present drew weapons and pointed them at the red helmeted stranger, intent on protecting Nightwing.<br />
<br />
Roy sighed dramatically. &quot;Just give him a hug, Jay. You know he won't leave you alone till you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nightwing said grinning, &quot;Give your favorite brother a hug!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a stir in the crowd. This guy was Dick's brother?<br />
<br />
The man laughed. &quot;Yeah, no. Narrows is my favorite brother, not you. And I will shoot you if you don't back away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick frowned. &quot;Come on, I know they're rubber bullets. You promised.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man cocked his head, followed by his weapons. &quot;They still hurt like a b*tch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick sighed. &quot;But you won't actually shoot me. B would be mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As a very wise person once said,&quot; the gun-toting man countered, &quot; 'The Old Man can go yeet himself off a building for all I care!' &quot;<br />
<br />
Dick glared. &quot;Don't use my own words against me. I will reciprocate.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man sighed and put his guns back in their holsters, then held out his arms. Dick grinned and rushed forward for his hug. It was quick, though the stranger seemed to relax in those few seconds. Everyone lowered their weapons.<br />
<br />
Once the embrace was over, the man reached up and removed his helmet and tucked it under his arms. &quot;Introduce us to the Team, would you? I haven't seen them in ages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I have never had the pleasure,&quot; the woman added, a serene smile on her face.<br />
<br />
Dick nodded then looked around at the group surrounding him, as if seeing them for the first time. He straightened, and adopted his usual more serious air. &quot;This is Starfire, a Tamarean by the name of Koriand'r, and Red Hood, also known as Jason Todd. Former Robin. Along with Arsenal, they make up the Outlaws.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Former Robin?&quot; M'gann asked, &quot;Jason?&quot;<br />
<br />
Red Hood smirked. &quot;I died. I got better. Nice to see ya, M'gann.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone stared, from those who had known Jason when he was a part of the Team, and those from later on, who'd seen his memorial. No one spoke a word 'till Batman and Robin strolled into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey Hood.&quot; Tim said. &quot;Kory.&quot; He nodded politely. &quot;Roy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; 'Sup Replacement. Batsy.&quot; Red Hood stalked right up to them. He reached out and affectionately gave Tim a noogey. He cried out in outrage before jumping away. Jason turned to Batman, seemingly expectantly. &quot;So?&quot; he asked, &quot;I came. You gonna get your lecture out of the way?&quot;<br />
<br />
Batman sighed before resting one guantled hand on the younger man's shoulder. &quot;Thank you for being here, Jason.&quot; and, as if that were too much emotion for him, he turned and left the room with a sweep of his cape. Right before he went out of sight, however, he called over his shoulder. &quot;You can stay in there and wait for the others or wander. Just don't break anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the confused swirling of everyone's mind, one thought arose.<br />
<br />
Others?<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
All was quiet for a while after the strange encounter with the Outlaws. Roy had gone around and introduced Jason and Kory, and at one point some Kryptonian named Supergirl joined the group, a few leaguers coming in to greet her. But overall it was quite still and calm.<br />
<br />
That is, until the zeta whirred and the computer spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unrecognized, D-04. Override: Batman 02.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone turned to the fading yellow light in time to see a feminine figure appear. She wore a solid purple bodysuit and dramatic cape, with black boots and gloves. She had a black and silver utility belt, along with a silver thigh strap. She also had a black bandoleer with a silver loop. Her face was masked by a wall of solid black, with two solid white lenses peaking out. The group swore those eyes were staring into their souls.<br />
<br />
Surrounding her was a haze of purple glitter, which rained down from above her, and seeped out from the zeta platform. Her hands were raised dramatically above her head, and her hip was cocked to the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's up, B*tches? I have arrived!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone was silent, staring at the glitter dissipating. From the back of the room, Robin groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot; the girl asked. &quot;How dare you disrespect the Purple People Eater!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she a villain?&quot; Jaime asked, eyes wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse,&quot; Robin said.<br />
<br />
The girl laughed. &quot;I'm his ex!&quot; She strolled out from the zeta platform, lowering her arms. She halted when a voice called from the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dead Robins' Club, where you at?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Outlaws strolled into the room, being led by Jason. The Red Hood walked right up to the purple clothed girl, and raised his hand for a high five. Being over six feet tall, it was way too high for her. She paused, tilted her head, and proceeded to judo-flip Jason to the ground. She lightly slapped his now open palm, and stepped over his groaning body, continuing on her way.<br />
<br />
She reached Robin - who had been trying to hide behind Batman, but got dragged out - and the pair began a very long and complex secret handshake. It ended with the pair fistbumping, and each doing a backflip away from each other.<br />
<br />
She then turned to Nightwing, who had just come into the room. He caught sight of her, and immediately exited again.<br />
<br />
She turned back to Batman and put her hands on her hips. &quot;Where are my waffles?&quot;<br />
<br />
Batman glared down at her. Everyone was sure the girl would balk - even Superman flinched under the full force of the Batgare(tm)!<br />
<br />
The girl laughed. &quot;You know I need them to function, you old furry! So, where are my waffles?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gasps sounded around the room. This stranger just called Batman a furry? Oh boy, he was gonna break his no-kill rule, wasn't he? Would their inability to halt the Dark Knight make them complicite in the crime? Would they have to bring Batman in for murder?<br />
<br />
In the end, no death of the purple-imp took place. Batman gave a long suffering sigh, and brought his gloved hands to the bridge of his nose. &quot;You had waffles before you got here, you don't need anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl was silent, her hands strongly on her hips, and a fierce glare emanated from behind the mask. A moment later, Batman broke.<br />
<br />
Broke.<br />
<br />
Batman.<br />
<br />
She defeated Batman in a battle of wills.<br />
<br />
This girl was scary.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're in the cafeteria. I made sure we were stocked up for you. All your favorite toppings as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl perked up. &quot;Aw, thanks Batsy! You spoil me, y'know? Be careful, people might start thinking I'm one of your kids!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a room in my house and routinely steal my credit cards atop your monthly allowance. You are one of my kids, whether I like it or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl shrugged. &quot;Fair enough. See ya!&quot; She reached up and booped Batman.<br />
<br />
Booped.<br />
<br />
Batman.<br />
<br />
She then turned and strolled out of the room. &quot;MY WAFFLES AWAIT!&quot;<br />
<br />
All was quiet for a moment longer, before the dozens of heroes burst into chatter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was that?&quot; Cassie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's her deal with waffles?&quot; Garfield added.<br />
<br />
Jaime raised his hand. &quot;She gets an allowance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She steals your credit cards?&quot; La'gaan demanded. &quot;And you let her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold up,&quot; Karen said, &quot;She's Tim's ex?&quot;<br />
<br />
Virgil shook his head. &quot;Anyone else confused about what just happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How'd she do the thing with the glitter,&quot; Zatanna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is she?&quot; Cassie repeated.<br />
<br />
Batman held up a hand, and everyone quieted down. He gave a long suffering sigh before answering everyone's questions in a tired yet monotone voice. One could describe it as Done(tm).<br />
<br />
&quot;That was Stephanie Brown. She's usually the current Batgirl, but after a few ... less than savory encounters with a villain called Condiment King, her uniform is ... in for repairs. So she's going by her first moniker: Spoiler. She's also the fourth Robin. Waffles are her favorite food, and she requires them to function. She gets an allowance, and basically lives with me and my family, all of whom think it's funny to steal my credit cards. She and Tim dated for a while, but now she's proclaimed herschel to be 'too good for him anyway'. I ... don't know how she deals with glitter. It's apparently a trade secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's been Robin and Batgirl?&quot; Conner asked, a touch of awe in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right, folks!&quot; Stephanie called from a balcony overlooking the group. They looked up to find her with her mask off, eating an outrageously large stack of waffle with a hunting knife that had a bat symbol on it. &quot;And I talk back to Batman!&quot; She raised her arms over her head like a villainess.<br />
<br />
&quot;FEAR ME!!&quot;<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
To say everyone was a tad traumatized after Spoiler's explosive entrance would be a lie. The once silent wanderings of heroes had developed into a hum of anticipation. Batman hadn't given any more information about Stephanie, or who else was coming, so each time the zeta tube fired up, attention was immediately drawn to it. More and more heroes came to join the awaiting group.<br />
<br />
The first few times had been a let down, some Green Lantern, and a couple other obscure heroes that Wonder Woman and Green Arrow had called in. The next time the zeta whirred, however, it was different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unrecognized, D-07. Override: Batman 02.&quot;<br />
<br />
Several League members along with the full Team turned hesitantly to the zeta platform. The light flashed, and faded to leave a tall figure dressed in gold armor, with a red tunic and flowing yet ragged cape. A hood was pulled up, and a red mask covered his face. In his hand, he held a flaming gold sword.<br />
<br />
For a long moment the man was still, leaving the other occupants to whisper to each other. Then, the sword's strange fire was extinguished, and he sheathed the blade on his back. A moment later, he strolled forward into the mass of heroes, ignoring them all in favor of the Dark Knight standing in the back. Waves of menace flowed off of him as he parted the sea of people. It was so unlike the spontaneous chaos from Spoiler, it was quite unnerving. The man paused before Batman, both of them drawn up and calculating. They were so similar, yet so different.<br />
<br />
They stared at each other for a long moment before the stranger reached up and removed his mask. In an instant, his whole demeanor changed. The anger and menace fell off of him, revealing a confident young man with long blond hair and a small smile of his face.<br />
<br />
He reached into somewhere in his armor and pulled out a pair of round glasses. Putting them on, he spoke. &quot;Hello Bruce, I came as soon as you called. I hear there's an alien invasion that you need my help with?&quot;<br />
<br />
Batman nodded, relaxing as well. &quot;Yes, Jean-Paul. They'll be here in a few hours. In the meantime, feel free to introduce yourself or look around. There's a library near the cafeteria that you might be interested in. Keep an eye out for Stephanie though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jean-Paul nodded. &quot;Of course. That sounds good. I also have a message from Oracle. She says that she's sorry she couldn't stop them. The enemy's plan is in action, and nothing short of a miracle will halt the carnage.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a stir in the crowd. Barbara was the best hacker they knew, so she must have been put on stopping the aliens before they got there. But how would she access their systems? Were they already here?<br />
<br />
Batman only sighed. &quot;Thank you, Jean-Paul.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man nodded before looking back at the group. &quot;Is there a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
Beast Boy was the only one brave enough to speak. &quot;Hi! I'm Garfield!&quot; he said, stepping forward. &quot;Who are you? And how do you know Batman? Also, that's a cool sword! &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Jean-Paul Valley,&quot; he answered, smiling. &quot;Although when I am wearing the mask I am known as Azrael. That is the Sword of Sin, I'm glad you like it. And Batman and I have known each other for years, we both work in Gotham.&quot;<br />
<br />
Huh, this guy was pretty normal. The Team relaxed, certain that the strange terror was limited to only Spoiler.<br />
<br />
Jean-Paul nodded to the group and went for the exit. &quot;Now, if you'll excuse me, I really would like to do some reading. It's been so long, I haven't enjoyed one of Bruce's libraries since back when I was Batman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh.<br />
<br />
There it was.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Batman had been bombarded with questions for the past ten minutes when Nightwing came into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on?&quot; He asked, warily watching the crowd of heroes encircling the Dark Knight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know that Thor-Copy-Cat was Batman?!&quot; L'gaan demanded, whirling on the former Robin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thor copy-cat?&quot; Dick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He means Jean-Paul.&quot; They looked over to find Jason leaning against a wall, still nursing his shoulder with an ice pack.<br />
<br />
Dick laughed, holding onto his stomach. &quot;Thor copy-cat! Jean-Paul! Oh that's perfect.&quot; he wiped the non-existent tear from his eye. &quot;I need to use that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know?&quot; Conner asked.<br />
<br />
Dick frowned. &quot;I mean, yeah? So have others. I even did it for almost a year, at one point.&quot; He paused. &quot;What, you didn't think there have been more than one bat other than Bruce?&quot;<br />
<br />
The group was quietly embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well besides Batgirl....&quot;<br />
<br />
All Gotham vigilantes present in the room - Red Hood, Nightwing, Robin, and Batman - shared a knowing look. Well, not with Bruce.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really are adorable,&quot; Jason said, checking his phone for the time. &quot;This'll be great.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before anyone could question the reactions, the zeta tubes whirred.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unrecogised, D-08. Override: Batman 02&quot;<br />
<br />
This time, the man standing in the tube was unmistakably a bat. He wore a silver armored suit - that honestly looked a lot like Iron Man - with a blue glowing bat symbol, and a bat-like helmet. The latter of which had glowing blue lenses which matched the bat, as well as detailing the lining of his suit.<br />
<br />
Everyone stared, a collective feeling of 'oh crap' running through their heads. This guy was 100% a bat.<br />
<br />
&quot;BATMAN!&quot; He yelled across the large room, when the zeta finished cooling down. &quot;What's this about an alien invasion?&quot;<br />
<br />
Batman sighed heavily. &quot;They'll be here in a couple hours, and I called you in for assistance -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that's the problem, isn't it!&quot; He said, stalking forward. &quot;You only call when something big is happening! The city is being attacked by aliens, or Bane is waging war. Never something simple or nice! You shipped me off to Africa, and yet you never call! The last person to actually email me was Dick! And you know how bad he is at contacting people!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
The man ignored Dick and kept ranting. &quot;Would it hurt to just check in every now and then? I know I'm not one of your kids, but 'honorary cousin' deserves at least some recognition, right? Just a phone call is all I ask for! Or a letter! Heck, I'd even take a telegram!&quot;<br />
<br />
He walked right up till he was nose to nose with Batman, and the Dark Knight spoke. &quot;You're right, I apologize.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man nodded, somewhat satisfied. A moment later, he replied. A hint of slyness creeping into his voice. &quot;You know what would be nice? If someone were to ask how I was doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Batman sighed. &quot;How are you doing, Batwing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Batwing relaxed. &quot;Good. And thanks, Bruce. I really appreciate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were several gasps, this time from the resident bats.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got him to apologize?&quot; Tim asked, his eyes wide beneath the mask.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's showing emotion!&quot; Jason cried. &quot;Watch out! The world's about to end!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick shook his head. &quot;He acted caringly. I've waited years for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Batman scowled. &quot;I've shown emotion before.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were several scoffs. &quot;Dick's right, Bruce,&quot; Batwing said, &quot;It's pretty rare. And I've known you for longer than him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait, he had? Who was this guy?<br />
<br />
There was no chance to ask these questions, as suddenly over the intercom a female voice boomed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Attention all members of the Justice League, and strangely unnamed Team (y'know, you should really fix that). Please listen closely.&quot; she paused dramatically. &quot;Whichever speedster ate my third plate of waffles when I wasn't looking: your doom is inevitable. I saw the skid marks. There's no denying this. Not even Batman can stop me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuh,&quot; Batwing began, &quot;who let Steph up here without supervision.&quot;<br />
<br />
Batman sighed, but didn't answer.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, all three speedsters burst into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't tell me your hoard was coming!&quot; Barry exclaimed, waving his arms around. &quot;I told you, once was enough! I don't want to deal with them ever again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruce took a deep breath. &quot;It's all hands on deck,&quot; he replied, &quot;I have several operatives, and so it's in everyone's best interest to bring them in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; Wally replied, taking his place by Dick's side, &quot;The full force? That seems unnecessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dick laughed. &quot;You're just jealous. You know if all of us are here, there'd be no need for the league.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wally frowned &quot;I mean, that's true, but still.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you both are so moding,&quot; Bart exclaimed, unable to contain himself. &quot;The full Batfamily? Here? Together? And I get to meet them?&quot; He raced over to Batwing, holding a notebook and pen. &quot;Could I get your autograph?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man nodded and took the notebook from him. &quot;Sure kid. You the time-traveller?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart grinned down at the autograph. &quot;This is so crash! And yup! Straight from the future!&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded again. &quot;Tell me, does Bruce ever stop adopting?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart froze, his eyes wide. &quot;Um ... how many are currently in the family?&quot;<br />
<br />
Batwing snorted beneath his helmet. &quot;Too many.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruce cleared his throat, and everyone looked towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Admit it, B,&quot; Dick said, an easy smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Admit what?&quot; Everyone looked over to find Jean-Paul entering the room, reading a book that was vaguely glowing blue. &quot;Oh, hello Lucas. Good to see you. How has Africa been?&quot;<br />
<br />
Batwing - Lucas? - took off his helmet, revealing a man in his mid twenties with dark skin, brown eyes, and short hair. He was also grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to see you too, dude.&quot; he nodded to the book. &quot;You do any exploring?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jean-Paul nodded. &quot;Oh, yes. The library is wonderful, and I also found where they keep alien technology, the cafeteria, game room, and training center. It's all quite interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas' eyes widened. &quot;Did you say tech?&quot; He looked towards Batman. &quot;He said tech, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruce nodded. &quot;Go ahead and check it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Despite what they proclaimed to be great danger, the three speedsters remained in the wide main space of the Watchtower. This turned out to be their downfall.<br />
<br />
It started like much of the previous encounters had: a whirring and flash of light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unrecogised, D-09. Override: Batman 02&quot;<br />
<br />
The figure standing in the tube this time was a young woman with blue and purple hair. Her uniform consisted of black pants and blue knee-high armoured boots, a belt with thigh straps that were dark grey, with a hint of a purple tint, a blue top with what could really only be described as an armoured corset, blue and yellow gloves, and a mask which covered her eyes then wrapped around with a chin guard. What really completed her outfit, however, was the ginormous gun that she carried with both hands.<br />
<br />
The girl grinned and walked forward. &quot;Hiya, Brucie! What's chilling? Dick. Jason. Tim. You guys good?&quot;<br />
<br />
She continued forward, and the group was put at ease by her friendly personality. Despite the gun, she seemed pretty normal! They should have noticed the malicious glee in her eyes.<br />
<br />
It was only when she passed the three speedsters that something happened. The girl tripped somehow on her own boot, twisting to the side, and fell onto her shoulder. Right before she hit the floor, her gun went off, letting loose a sharp stream of blue electricity that hit Barry Allen square in the chest.<br />
<br />
After a split second, everyone drew their weapons. This girl just shot a major leaguer! But Batman waved them down. He had a look of consternation on his face, and didn't look too bothered by the turn of events, despite what was obviously a purposeful attack on the Flash. Come on, no one falls that perfectly.<br />
<br />
Other than a bat.<br />
<br />
The girl leapt to her feet. &quot;Oh my gosh, are you okay? I'm so sorry! The gun must have malfunctioned! I just recalibrated it earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
No reply came, seeing as the fastest man alive was currently a groaning, unconscious form collapsed on the floor.<br />
<br />
She tilted her head - not looking too concerned - and turned to Jason. &quot;Yo, Hood, you know guns. Mind checking mine for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason grinned. &quot;Why, Bluebird, it would be my pleasure!&quot;<br />
<br />
He jogged over to the now-named Bluebird and took the gun from her. He twisted it around in his grip, searching for something. He doesn't seem to find it, however, resting it normally back in his grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Narrows, I can't seem to figure out -&quot;<br />
<br />
He was cut off by the gun suddenly letting loose another blast. It coincidently occured right as Barry was sitting up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happ-&quot; he started to say, but was knocked right back to the floor.<br />
<br />
Jason jumped back, eyes wide. &quot;Oh yeah, there's something really wrong with that.&quot; he glanced over at Batman, who was glaring at him. &quot;Clearly not a fault of the operator. You might wanna get it checked out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bluebird takes her gun back and slings it over her back before approaching Barry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, I'm really sorry,&quot; she announces before bending down and grabbing his shoulders. She paused for a moment before pulling him up.<br />
<br />
Now, to anyone else, she might have seemed petulant. Sure, no one was completely convinced that it was an accident - is anything with the bats (and yeah, she was definitely a bat) - but Bluebird couldn't have actually meant to hurt him, right?<br />
<br />
No one knew for certain, except Conner. Because of his super-hearing he knew exactly what Bluebird whispered into the Flash's ear when she helped him up:<br />
<br />
&quot;Those are for Spoiler's Waffles.&quot;<br />
<br />
The half kryptonian paled, and took a step back. M'gann turned to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; she asked over the mindlink.<br />
<br />
Conner swallowed and looked back to where Bluebird was brushing off Barry's back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he replied, purposefully not giving a reason. M'gann seemed to understand and turned back to watch the bats.<br />
<br />
Bluebird had moved on from the speedsters - she'd already given her autograph to Bart, and gave a hug to a trembling Wally - and was conversing with Jason.<br />
<br />
Just then, a large purple shape leapt out from the balcony above them. Their cape snapped out and Spoiler landed in a kneeling position right in front of the trio of speedsters. She rose up and looked at the dazed and swaying Barry Allen, and fear-filled Wally West and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;fate has a funny way of divvying out vengeance, doesn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
She twirled and stalked over to Bluebird. &quot;What's up roomie?&quot; she asked, and the pair fist bumped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good, Steph.&quot; Bluebird replied, grinning. &quot;It'll be even better when our numbers are complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie nodded solemnly &quot;it is no light thing to be away from our fellow sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Batman sighed heavily. &quot;Why are you like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair turned to him, and spoke in unison. &quot;It's the trauma.&quot;<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
For the next few minutes, Bluebird and Spoiler wandered around the room, making small talk with the other heroes. It was discovered - after Bluebird jumped into a conversation between Roy, Will, and Jim proclaiming, &quot;The best Harper has arrived!&quot; - that the young woman was named Harper Row, and came from the Narrows in Gotham. She and Stephanie were roommates, as well as members of something called 'The Cult of having a decent Fashion Sense - Looking at you, Discowing'(tm).<br />
<br />
The speedsters had escaped to the far corner of the room, only Bart left to make the rounds for autographs, and were currently being Protected by Batman.<br />
<br />
The duet of destruction had slowly been circling closer to those hiding behind the World's Greatest Detective, but halted when yet another new arrival was announced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unrecogised, D-10. Override: Batman 02&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet another feminine figure stood in the wake of the golden light, yet this one was far less colorful.<br />
<br />
She was petite, but made it up for her dramatic all-black leather and kevlar bodysuit. She had the thin outline of a bat on her chest in yellow, which matched the utility belt at her waist.  She had a long flowing cape that pooled from her shoulder spikes all down to around her feet. Her cowl had long ears hand extended all down her face, covering her mouth with extra, obvious lines of stitching.<br />
<br />
She stood still for a long moment before tilting her head. The room felt like it dropped a few degrees under her stare. It was eerily similar to the effect Batman had on, well ... pretty much everyone.<br />
<br />
She didn't say anything as she walked slowly yet purposefully into the ranks of earth's finest. Past La'gaan, Garfield, and Karen in a huddle to the right. Past Raquel, Jaime, Cassie, Virgil, and Plastic man, who were spread out slightly to the left. Past Zatanna, Captain Marvel, Hawkman, Captain Adam, as well as Roy and Koriand'r, who were spread out to the right. She ignored Conner &amp; M'gann, and Will &amp; Cheshire to her right, and other assorted bats to her left. Except one.<br />
<br />
She wasn't the first to go straight for the Dark Knight, but she definitely was the first to ignore him, opting to take her place at his right side, standing still like a lieutenant at attention.<br />
<br />
The others looked on in hesitant interest. So far, no one was traumatized.<br />
<br />
Batman turned to the young woman, and it was quite disconcerting. They looked almost identical, if you set aside the size differences.<br />
<br />
&quot;Black Bat, how are the final preparations going in Gotham?&quot;<br />
<br />
The newly named Black Bat tilted her head.<br />
<br />
Batman nodded. &quot;Good, thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded and turned back to stare at the group in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, Cass!&quot; Spoiler called, racing over. &quot;Did you bring the goods?&quot;<br />
<br />
Black Bat - Cass? - Nodded and reached into her utility belt, pulling out a small brown pouch. She reached in two fingers, and pulled them up revealing a soft silver powder the same shade as the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; Bluebird said, rubbing her hands together in anticipation.<br />
<br />
Everyone looked on in horror of whatever they were planning, but didn't say a thing. Even Batman looked a touch uneasy.<br />
<br />
Stephanie grinned and plucked the pouch from the mini-Batman's hand. Then she looked at Batman. &quot;You gonna say anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
Batman grunted.<br />
<br />
Black Bat seemed to grin beneath her mask. &quot;Too scared.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bluebird nodded. &quot;It's times like these that I really appreciate you being able to beat up Batman.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were several choked gasps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pardon?&quot; Jaime asked. &quot;I don't think that's possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spoiler put a hand on her hip. &quot;Not for Batman's daughter!&quot;<br />
<br />
There several more gasps.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right, ladies and gentlemen!&quot; Bluebird proclaimed, &quot;You are in the presence of the one and only: Cassandra Cain-Wayne!&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair of vigilantes simultaneously stepped to either side of Black Bat and kneeled with their arms raised above their bowed heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;The daughter of Lady Shiva and David Cain, our lady and savior was raised from birth to be an assassin, she was never taught to speak.&quot; Spoiler announced dramatically.<br />
<br />
&quot;But she persevered!&quot; Bluebird continued. &quot;She escaped when she was only a wee babe and after years of toil and misfortune, made her way to the fearful land of Gotham!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There, she was taken in by the mighty Oracle, and the Dark Knight. Her worthiness granted her the position of Batgirl, which she bore with strength.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After long, brave battles, she engaged her mother, Lady Shiva, the deadliest person on earth, in a battle to the death!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The awe-some Batgirl unleashed her prowess, and after being killed by her mother - on purpose - was brought back to life by a magic tea and managed to defeat the woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From then on, she was proclaimed the deadliest person on earth, in her mother's stead. She returned to Gotham, and was adopted by Batman ('cause this guy really can't resist small, traumatized kids, sheesh) and truly became a member of the family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From then on, she claimed the one true title that outshone all the rest, the one that was destined for her since birth.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair looked at each other. &quot;Bruce's favorite child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hear her name and tremble!&quot; Spoiler cried out, &quot;oh she who is next in line for the mantle of the Dark Knight. Oh she who has Batman wrapped around her little finger!&quot;<br />
<br />
They rose in unison, and bowed to Cassandra. They kept their heads down low and they backed away from her presence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is ...&quot; Garfield asked quietly, &quot;is that all true?&quot;<br />
<br />
Batman looked to Black Bat with something akin to pride in his expression. &quot;Yes, Cassandra is a skilled and accomplished warrior. But I don't have a favorite child.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young woman preened under the praise, before seeming to frown. &quot;Yes, you do,&quot; she proclaimed, tapping her chest.<br />
<br />
Batman frowned right back at her. &quot;Why don't you go cause chaos with Harper and Stephanie?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded. &quot;The truth is hard. I understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassandra whirled around and stalked away from him with a self satisfied air. She pulled off her cowl as she left, revealing an asian young woman with pale skin, a short bob, and smiling lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; she said, upon reaching her destination, &quot;Where are the waffles?<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
The zeta tube whirred yet again, and everyone glanced towards it quite hesitantly, after the previous encounters. But there was still this morbid fascination. One that had drawn several major leagues, and members of the Team who had not been present before.<br />
<br />
But this time instead of some stranger, or vaguely friendly-looking hero, every single person in the main area of the Watchtower knew exactly who the</td>

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're Doctor Bruce Banner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bruce looked up at the high-pitched squeak, momentarily startled at the young sounding voice. He blinked behind his glasses, taking in the bright-eyed, young face that was staring at him with his mouth open. Bruce glanced around the Compound Lab where he was working but he was alone. He hadn't been expecting any company, especially that of someone so young.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Bruce said, looking back to the teenager.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Having been off Earth, stuck as the Hulk on an alien planet, found by Thor, battled Thor's sister with Loki and a Valkyrie and then returned to earth with the remaining Asgardian's, Bruce was aware he had a lot to catch up on - starting with how a teenager was allowed in the Compound. Before he had a chance to ask the teenager who he was, the kid was already rambling.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe I'm talking to The Bruce Banner,&quot; the teenager gaped with awe. &quot;The greatest theoretical physicist of all time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't say -&quot; Bruce stuttered, warmth filling his cheeks in a way they hadn't for a long time.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're work into the studies of nuclear physics and gamma radiation is unreal,&quot; the teenager ploughed on. &quot;We're studying you and your work at the moment in class-&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Bruce interrupted, holding up a hand to pause the kid. &quot;You study me at school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duh!&quot; the teenager all but rolled his eyes. &quot;One of the greatest scientists in the world who doesn't look like he came from the dinosaur age, of course we're studying you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bruce opened his mouth to say something but found himself at a loss of words. It had been a long time since he had seen anyone excited about his work. Ever since the accident Bruce had all but disappeared from the scientific community. There were not many who wanted to work with him, not when he could turn into a giant green monster. He had been so grateful when Tony had offered him a lab to work in after the events with Loki in New York, (and trying to tell Tony and the others that Loki had changed, that he had helped take down Thor's sister was still an ongoing process) never thinking that he would work in such a lab ever again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your thesis on gamma radiation is fascinating,&quot; the teenager continued to ramble, seemingly unaware that he was in the process of blowing Bruce's mind.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bruce had thought he had become irrelevant in the scientific world and yet this teenager was looking at him as if he had hung the moon. He could hardly believe that the kid was rattling off his thesis, delving deep into his ideas on gamma radiation like he was reading a recipe off a box. When the kid finally took a breath, Bruce jumped in with a question of his own.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; the teenagers face went bright pink and he shuffled from foot to foot. &quot;I'm Peter Parker.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bruce smiled. &quot;It's nice to meet you, Peter Parker.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you too,&quot; Peter beamed. &quot;Ned is going to freak when I tell I met you. I can't believe I'm talking to Bruce Banner!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, well,&quot; Bruce stammered. &quot;I won't be that impressive. Not with how brilliant you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter face went red. &quot;You think I'm brilliant,&quot; he squeaked out.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bruce chuckled. &quot;You have a far better understanding of my work than some of my colleagues I went to university with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter shook his head, his curls bouncing. &quot;No way. You're like, brilliant. Like Mr. Stark. Hey! Is it true that you and Mr. Stark studied together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;We attended Dr. Derenik Zadian's &quot;Forward Thought Conference&quot; at Oxford University together,&quot; Bruce smiled. &quot;Huh, seems like a lifetime ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was Mr. Stark like?&quot; Peter asked eagerly. &quot;Did he have his goatee? Did he still wear cat t-shirts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bruce laughed, leaning back in his chair. &quot;He was clean shaven back then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way,&quot; Peter whispered, eyes going wide as if he had just been given the secret to the universe. &quot;Hey Doctor Banner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can call me Bruce.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter grinned shyly. &quot;Do you think...could I ask you some questions for my essay? We have to research a significant figure in history that had contributed to the world of science and technology, and I want to choose you. If that's okay? Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, are you sure?&quot; Bruce blinked, thinking that there were far more interesting subjects than himself.<br />
<br />
Peter nodded frantically. &quot;Everyone will be so jealous! Even my chem teacher.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Flattered, Bruce accepted. It occurred to him about an hour later that he still had no idea who Peter was. The kid was obviously brilliant and insightful and made Bruce wonder if he was the child of someone who worked at the Compound.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bruce and Peter paused mid-conversation to watch Tony stride into the room. He looked perfectly at ease, even looking a little amused as he approached the two of them.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;There I was, waiting in the kitchen with cheeseburgers, thick shakes and fries,&quot; Tony begun.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter perked up. &quot;Chocolate thick shakes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Underoos, chocolate,&quot; Tony chuckled. &quot;Which is now melting on the kitchen bench all because you wondered off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Stark!&quot; Peter protested. &quot;It's Doctor Banner!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah kiddo, I know,&quot; Tony reached out and ruffled Peter's hair, giving Bruce a wink.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You knew?&quot; Peter pouted at Tony, his eyes going sad.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bruce immediately felt guilty at kicked-puppy dog look Peter was sporting. Tony apparently felt the same because he physically winced.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh kid. I'm sorry. I totally forgot to mention that Bruce was back,&quot; Tony apologised. He pulled Peter close to his chest. &quot;Sorry kiddo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;S'okay,&quot; Peter pulled back from Tony's hug and grinned. &quot;Doctor Banner's been helping me with my homework!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's great,&quot; Tony smiled back. &quot;How about we give Brucie a break and you something to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheeseburgers in the kitchen, right?&quot; Peter asked, already bounding up out of his seat.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Tony confirmed, and Peter dashed out of the room before Bruce could blink.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The scientist turned to Tony, peeling off his glasses and silently asking for an explanation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tony held up a finger and silently took the seat that Peter had just vacated. He waited a few minutes before speaking, keeping his voice low. &quot;Hell of a kid that Peter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a genius,&quot; Bruce stated.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Tony beamed. &quot;Could be in college if he wanted to be. Hell, he could be finished college but his aunt wants to keep in him in school with his friends which I agree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's yours,&quot; Bruce blurted out, his mind reeling.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Tony shook his head. &quot;Not biologically. No, I just get the privilege of teaching him, of getting to know him. He's going to be the future, Bruce.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that,&quot; Bruce exhaled loudly. &quot;His knowledge is impressive and his ideas, even if they were offhand, have real potential.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;If he's not yours, how did you meet?&quot; Bruce asked curiously. He knew that Tony wasn't in the habit of hanging around teenagers.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tony smiled tightly. &quot;You had your troubles working with radioactive particles and so did Peter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bruce eyes widened. &quot;He was exposed to radioactive materials?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Radioactive spider,&quot; Tony corrected. &quot;I found him through YouTube in a homemade onesie, stopping a speeding car with his bare hands&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's enhanced,&quot; Bruce stated. Bruce couldn't believe it. Peter didn't look enhanced. Then again, if you didn't know Bruce you wouldn't think there was a green personality waiting to break free. &quot;Strength?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speed, hearing, metabolism, healing,&quot; Tony listed ff on his fingers. &quot;And the kid is sticky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sticky?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Picture a spider crawling up a wall. Now picture Peter doing that. It's creepy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is not,&quot; Peter's voice drifted into the room and a second later he reappeared, polishing off a cheeseburger.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I get a drink in the middle of the night and find you asleep on the ceiling it's creepy,&quot; Tony shot back with a grin.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chicken,&quot; Peter said gleefully, all but skipping over to them and dropping down in the seat beside Tony.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, Bruce can be the decider. Go ahead, show him,&quot; Tony said, jerking his chin towards the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Peter grinned and jumped up. Then, in one swift move, he jumped from the floor the ceiling and hung there by just his hands and feet.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bruce's eyes widened with shock as he stared at Peter.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead, Bruce. Tell Peter it's creepy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
While the two squabbled, Bruce couldn't help but chuckle softly. He may have missed a lot, but he could see the differences in Tony and how Peter had shaped him into the man he was today. Peter was good for Tony and Bruce had never seen his friend so relaxed and happy. Being a dad was a good look for him.<br />

<br />
James wasn't a great liar, for all that he tried. Remus would probably say that was why they got caught during their pranks so often, and he would probably be right. He nearly always was, the bastard. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This being said, dating Regulus Black was the easiest and most difficult thing he'd ever done. Easy, because Regulus made him feel at ease in ways he'd never known he could. There was a lightness that filled his body when Regulus was around that he had yet to find anywhere else. His mum would probably tell him that it was love, and she would probably be right. She nearly always was. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It was difficult, because it was a secret, and though James really, really loved having Regulus all to himself, it did complicate things a bit. Namely, when, where, and how they could meet up. There was also the issue of Sirius, who probably wouldn't be incredibly pleased to know that James was dating his younger brother in secret. Partly because James and Sirius didn't do secrets, and partly because Sirius was extremely protective of both of them. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They were going to tell him at some point, really. They had to, if they expected things between them to last, but the prospect was terrifying enough that they'd agreed to keep things on the low until they could figure out how, exactly to reveal that they were together. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus was an excellent liar, which sort of turned James on, if he was being honest. It shouldn't have, James didn't really value dishonesty as a character trait, but there was something incredibly sexy about Regulus lying to people, right to their face, and never raising a single doubt. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Still, Regulus couldn't carry their secret on his back, though he'd been doing his best to. James had already failed miserably at convincing some of his friends he wasn't seeing anyone, so now he was just trying to keep his head above water enough to make sure they didn't find out <br />
<br />
who<br />
<br />
&nbsp;he was seeing. Sirius, thankfully, was not a part of this group, because he certainly wouldn't have stopped until he found out every detail. As far as the others were concerned, there were enough students at Hogwarts that they wouldn't figure it out right away, but not enough that they wouldn't figure it out eventually.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lily had already figured it out, actually, when they'd stumbled upon each other in equally compromising situations with a secret partner. James and Lily had shared indignant remarks while Regulus and Mary had exchanged terse nods of unspoken alliance, and none of them had addressed it since. James didn't mind Lily knowing, though, because she was a better liar than he was, and, if it came to it, and he couldn't convince the rest of their friends that he wasn't seeing anyone particularly interesting to them, she could. Plus, Mary was an unexpectedly great ally, because she was a master at changing the subject, especially where Sirius was concerned. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James and Regulus made a habit of meeting up in the quidditch changing rooms, because they tended to go unbothered after all the practices were over for the day. Most couples went to the Astronomy tower or an abandoned classroom, though the changing rooms were really rather well suited for a hearty snog. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One afternoon, James mentioned this to Regulus, and Regulus gagged as he pulled away from James. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Please tell me you did not just say the words 'hearty snog' out loud,&quot; Regulus said, aghast.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what's embarrassing?&quot; James asked, ignoring Regulus' exasperation. &quot;The fact that I can say 'hearty snog', and you're still turned on.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus dropped his mouth open, then shut it just as quickly, his pale face going bright red. James really loved nothing more than making him blush like that. If only because he knew Regulus would find a way to make him blush just as deeply in revenge. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the meantime, though, Regulus just tipped his head back, curls falling away from his face, and bit his lip, very clearly trying not to give James the satisfaction of being right. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James trailed a finger along his Adam's apple, enjoying how Regulus' fingers tightened around his arm. Regulus returned his gaze to James, grey eyes dark and depthless as the night, and James met him with the smile he reserved only for him. James had a lot of smiles, and no one really saw him going anywhere without one, but Regulus was the only person that got to see this one. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You're annoying,&quot; Regulus said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You love it,&quot; James said. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus ran his hands up the sides of James' arms, bringing them to rest at the base of his neck, tangling in the ends of his messy hair. James settled his own hands on Regulus' waist, liking, as always, how his slender but sharp frame felt within his grasp. &quot;I do,&quot; Regulus said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James grinned as he tipped his head down for a kiss. Regulus wasn't all that much shorter than he was, but he liked the few inches that he had on him. He felt like he could protect him better, curl Regulus into his arms and never let him go. Regulus pretended to be annoyed by it, but James knew that he liked it too. No one had ever cared for him the way James did, and though it made James' heart break, he was honored to give that kind of love and care. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As always, their kisses turned from soft to passionate in the blink of an eye. Off went their shirts, and then James had Regulus pressed up against the lockers, Regulus' legs wrapped around his waist, and it was perfect, perfect--<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That is, until the door slammed open, and James did the only thing he could think to do, and turned into a stag. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(Thank Merlin Regulus already knew he was an animagus, otherwise this plan would have been even worse than it already was.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus sent him a pleading stare before turning to see who'd interrupted them and freezing where he stood. James, as a stag, did the same. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sirius obviously recognized James in stag form, but he would never assume Regulus did. Slowly, he asked, &quot;Hey, Reg. Whatcha got there?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus ignored James entirely and grabbed his quidditch jersey from where James had thrown it onto the bench. &quot;Jersey,&quot; he said, lifting it up. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sirius blinked. &quot;I sort of meant the deer.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Regulus said, looking at James in surprise like he was just noticing him. &quot;I think it's a stag.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James couldn't drop his head into his hands, so he settled for poking Regulus with one of his antlers. Regulus shot him a glare, and Sirius looked like he was about to burst into laughter. Well, at least he'd believe James when he told Sirius this was some sort of prank later. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What is a stag doing in here?&quot; Sirius asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he wants to play quidditch,&quot; Regulus said dumbly, and James took back everything he'd ever said about Regulus being a good liar. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sirius narrowed his eyes. &quot;How do you know it's a he?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Females aren't called stags, and they don't have antlers. You'd know that if you studied for once in your life.&quot; Regulus crossed his arms, raising his eyebrows. &quot;The 'study session' you spend with Remus once a week doesn't count, because I know damn well that you two are not studying.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jesus Christ, the Black brothers were so easy to rile up. Sirius blushed just as furiously as Regulus had minutes before, but he didn't look embarrassed by it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James was always a bit wary when Regulus and Sirius interacted, not because he was worried about Sirius finding out about him and Reg, but because he never knew what would send their recently mended relationship back into a tailspin. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It was a whole thing, that Sirius had run away to James' family back in fifth year and Regulus hadn't come with him. According to Sirius, it was because Regulus refused to come, and according to Regulus it was because Sirius hadn't asked him. They hadn't spoken for months afterwards, until Walburga and Orion were sent to Azkaban for generalized awfulness, or something (James didn't particularly care about the details), and Regulus had moved in with their cousin Andromeda and her husband Ted until he came of age. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James and Regulus, who used to be sort of friends but had distanced quite a bit when things got tense with Sirius and Regulus had started to get close again in the period of time immediately following, and James had encouraged Regulus to reach out to his brother. He had said the same to Sirius as well, but it hadn't happened until Andromeda had practically forced a family reunion during the winter holidays that year. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Andromeda, Ted, their daughter Nymphadora, and Regulus had spent Christmas with the Potters and Sirius, and surprisingly, things had mended. James and Regulus had also kissed for the first time during that break, and the second, and the third, and so on, but it hadn't seemed right to say anything to Sirius at the time, with his and Regulus' relationship so precariously on the mend, and now four months later, they still hadn't found the right moment. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This, obviously, was also not that moment. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sirius didn't get mad at Regulus' jibe though, and flicked his hair over his shoulder. &quot;No need to be jealous because I'm getting some and you're not.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I am,&quot; Regulus said indignantly, &quot;I just don't get all star-eyed about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James, as a stag, snorted, because he knew that Regulus got very star-eyed indeed. It was honestly a shock no one had noticed it, but that was probably because they weren't looking. Regulus Black, in love? With a Gryffindor, nonetheless? Blasphemy! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sirius' eyes flicked over to James but he asked anyway, &quot;Wait, really? Who're you shagging? Why didn't you tell me! Ugh-- don't say it's Crouch.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus rolled his eyes. &quot;I'm not shagging anyone, calm down. I'm just saying, I <br />
<br />
could<br />
<br />
&nbsp;be.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sirius' excitement deflated. &quot;Oh. Well, I guess I'll leave you to it. Do you need the stag, or can I borrow him?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Why on earth would you need a stag?&quot; Regulus asked, quite convincingly. Good liar cred, restored. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Prank,&quot; Sirius said with a shrug. &quot;So?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;All yours,&quot; Regulus said, pulling a jumper over his head and turning towards his locker. James didn't miss the soft smile he sent his way before he did, though. If he hadn't been a stag at the moment, James would have sent one back. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, come on you,&quot; Sirius said to James, patting his legs exaggeratedly, luring him like a puppy. It would have been funnier to be stubborn about it, but James didn't really want Sirius to question anything further, so he went with him willingly, sending one last look behind him as he went, love swelling in his chest at the sight of Regulus doubled over laughing silently beside his locker. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
ii.<br />
<br />
<br />
After the changing room incident, Regulus and James had been more careful about, at the very least, keeping the map near them when they were together. The forbidden forest had, in some ways, become their sanctuary, despite the centaurs threatening them whenever they ran into them. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On a Hogsmeade Saturday, however, James and Regulus found themselves up in the Marauders dorm under the guise of James helping Reg study for his OWLS. Instead, Regulus was laying on top of James, and James was playing with his hair, and they were settled into their bliss. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Remus and Sirius were on a date, he thought, and Peter had been stolen away by the girls for something or other, which meant they pretty much had the whole day to themselves. It had been far too long since they'd had anything of the sort. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie?&quot; Regulus mumbled sleepily. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James bit the inside of his cheek, knowing Regulus could probably hear just how much his heart rate picked up at the nickname. His parents had called him Jamie when he was little, but hadn't for many years, and the Marauders never had, but James had mentioned liking the nickname once in passing-- long before he and Regulus had even kissed-- and Regulus still used it sparingly, but when he did it felt like he might explode with love. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; he replied, shifting his own head so he could look Regulus in the eyes. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus, however, was avoiding his gaze. &quot;I have to tell you... well, I don't <br />
<br />
have <br />
<br />
to, I want to, I suppose...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You've lost me,&quot; James said with a small laugh. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus grumbled, burying his head deeper into James' chest. He kept talking, but James couldn't make out what he was saying in the slightest. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He gently slid Regulus off of him and settled their bodies side by side, close enough that they were still tangled together, noses touching, but so Regulus couldn't hide himself away. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; James asked softly. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus was red in the face, looking vaguely uncomfortable and embarrassed, but James had no idea why. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He was silent for a long breath, in and out, and then he fixed those charcoal eyes on James, eyelashes long and inky black, just like the grown out hair that framed his face. James had made a point to mention how much he loved Regulus' hair when it was longer and a bit unruly, and Regulus hadn't cut it since then. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; Regulus said quietly. So quietly, in fact, that James, still distracted by his eyelashes, didn't hear it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He saw panic fill Regulus' eyes and realized he must have missed something important. &quot;What?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus' whole body was tense at this point, and James began to worry about what he'd said, but then he repeated, &quot;I love you,&quot; a little bit louder, and James melted, thinking that this would be remembered as one of the best moments of his life. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
His face split into a wide grin as he pressed their foreheads together, noses squishing. &quot;I love you, too,&quot; he said, with no hesitation, because it was something he'd felt for longer than Regulus probably realized. He hadn't said it because he hadn't wanted to rush things, or scare Regulus away, but now that he could? Oh man, he'd be saying it every minute of every day. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Some of the panic subsided from Regulus' eyes. &quot;You do?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The heart of the lion,&quot; James said, &quot;That's what your star is. And that's what you are to me. You're my whole heart, Reg.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus smiled slowly and let James peck him swiftly on the lips. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You love me,&quot; James said giddily. &quot;Regulus Black loves <br />
<br />
me<br />
<br />
.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't look so surprised, as if I could love anyone else,&quot; Regulus said, punctuated with an eyeroll like that wasn't the sweetest sentiment in the world. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because the moment was so blissful, so amazing, naturally the doorknob jiggled.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James was very glad he'd had the foresight to lock it, but startled regardless. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oi! Prongs! Why'd you lock the door?&quot; came Sirius' voice on the other side. They probably had about thirty seconds before Sirius remembered he was a wizard and could easily unlock the door, so James unceremoniously shoved Regulus off the bed. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus sputtered quietly as James apologized, &quot;Sorry, love you, can you hide under the bed?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you said they'd be gone all day!&quot; Regulus hissed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;They were supposed to be!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sirius knocked again. &quot;Are you having a wank? Use the bathroom like the rest of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin, Pads, I was-- I'm coming,&quot; James said, haphazardly throwing a shirt on and trying not to look like he'd spent all day in bed with someone. Regulus shot a hand out from under the bed, middle finger raised, and James bent down to kiss it before heading to the door.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sirius and Remus were arm in arm, and while Sirius looked him up and down slyly, Remus looked suspicious. Remus was the one who'd pieced together that James was seeing someone, but he knew Remus wouldn't say anything about it until he had all the details, which James did not intend on providing. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I was napping,&quot; James lied. Not so bad. Maybe Regulus was rubbing off on him. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you had studying to do?&quot; Remus asked. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you think I was napping?&quot; James joked, sitting down at the edge of his bed. Regulus poked his ankle. &quot;I thought you were on a date?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sirius snorted. &quot;We were. We were gone for five hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin, I've been asleep a long time,&quot; James said, feigning surprise. Remus snorted derisively, but Sirius didn't seem to notice. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, anyway, it's time for dinner. You coming?&quot; Sirius asked, rifling through his trunk for one of the many jumpers he'd stolen from Remus. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James hopped up, stopping Regulus from prodding at his ankles. &quot;Sure thing. You two go on, though, I should probably brush my teeth, I have sleep breath.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, gross,&quot; Sirius said, throwing on the jumper and grabbing onto Remus' hand, pulling him back out the door. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James waited until he heard their footsteps fade down the stairs, then hopped back up on his bed, peeking his head down to see Regulus' grumpy face underneath it. &quot;I love you,&quot; he said cheerily. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Regulus said, though his face softened, he shifted forward to kiss James, and James accidentally flipped off his bed in excitement. Regulus crawled out from under the bed, looking like a (cute) disaster. He held out a hand to help James up. &quot;You're ridiculous.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And you're Regulus,&quot; James said. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus pushed him onto the next bed over, which happened to belong to Sirius. Before James could say anything, Regulus was leaning over him and kissing him into the mattress. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I fucking knew it,&quot; said a tired voice from the doorway, and James and Regulus poked their heads in that direction in surprise and panic. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Remus leaned against the doorframe, rubbing his temples. &quot;Carry on,&quot; he said, &quot;Just get to dinner before Padfoot gets separation anxiety.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, aye, captain,&quot; James said, and Remus left the room, shutting the door behind him. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He won't tell--&quot; Regulus worried, but James shook his head. Regulus sighed in relief, then started to laugh. &quot;We're awful at this aren't we?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; James admitted, &quot;But you love me.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that have to do with anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot; James shrugged. &quot;Just like the reminder.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus grinned. &quot;Go to dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; James said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, love you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
iii. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The abandoned girl's bathroom was nothing if not good for a clandestine snog. About a week after their close shave in the dorm, Regulus and James had refrained from meeting up for any extended period of time, but still stole as many small moments as they could. Including now, during James' History of Magic class and Regulus' free period.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Their ties had been discarded and their robes were on the ground, shirts unbuttoned at least three buttons more than was decent. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't keep skiving off class if you want to pass your exams,&quot; Regulus said, his breath hot on James' neck. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Can this conversation happen when we're not snogging?&quot; James asked. He shivered as Regulus placed three kisses along his jawline.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just saying,&quot; Regulus said. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James brushed a thumb across Regulus' cheekbone, separating their faces enough to give him a knowing grin. &quot;You'd rather I was in Binns' class right now, hm?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus rolled his eyes. &quot;I didn't say <br />
<br />
that<br />
<br />
--&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I know everything anyway,&quot; James assured him. He probably didn't know as much as Regulus, who literally knew everything about everything, but he was one of the best students in his year, only behind Lily and Sirius, who were actual geniuses in the same way Reg was. Only difference was that Lily studied like it was breathing, and Sirius had never studied once in his life. Remus could beat James too, most times, but he'd laid off trying to to be the best once he realized it wouldn't matter much anyway, given his furry little problem. James resented this notion, but Remus attuned his genius to planning their pranks now, which James and Sirius agreed was a much better use of his time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know who led the 18th century Goblin revolution?&quot; Regulus asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Urg the Unclean, baby,&quot; James answered, pulling him back in for a kiss. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus giggled into it-- oh what a heavenly sound that was-- and said, &quot;I do love it when you talk dirty to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If only everyone knew what an absolute dork you are,&quot; James said dreamily against Regulus' lips. Regulus mumbled something back that sounded a bit like 'Gryffindork', but James kissed him through it before Regulus could try to distract him with trivia again. Though, maybe he should suggest some sort of raunchy study game... it seemed to work for Remus and Sirius, in any case. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus <br />
<br />
was<br />
<br />
&nbsp;a dork, though. He was quite witty, this much most everyone who spoke to him knew, and he used a lot of big words in long sentences, and he rarely smiled, and he had the most upright posture James had ever seen, and that was Regulus Black, certainly, but it wasn't the only side to him. The side James knew made horrible jokes but thought they were extremely funny, giggled instead of outright laughing, had a tendency of dropping his wand when he performed spells (and had, incredibly, developed an affinity for wandless magic because of it), had never once used the prefect bathroom because he hated baths and was afraid of drowning, and loved harder than anyone James had ever known, Sirius included. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus actually said very little in general, though he spoke the most when he was with James, but that only meant he chose his words more carefully than everyone else. James often got a sense that there were twelve different conversations happening inside Regulus' head at once, and he took his time to carefully craft responses to each one. James, whose mum had told him to think before he acts more times than he could count, could very much not relate. James thought it made them work, though. They were like fire and ice; sure they might work fine separately, but didn't the excitement come from them being mixed together? James was never worried about Regulus' ice, and Regulus had finally stopped worrying about being burned. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James wrapped his arms around Regulus' thighs and hoisted him up onto the sink, determined to do nothing but kiss the everloving shit out of this incredible boy of his for as long as humanly possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Which, of course, wasn't long at all. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Minutes later-- could have been an hour, really, but to James it felt like the blink of an eye-- Regulus tugged the collar on James' shirt and pulled back from his embrace. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to go,&quot; he said, &quot;Charms.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Booooo,&quot; James said, articulately. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;As compelling as that argument was,&quot; Regulus said, lazily waving his hand. His robes and tie were summoned to his hand in an instant. James stubbornly stayed where he was, one hand on Regulus' thigh, doing his best impression of Sirius' patented puppy dog eyes. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus picked up James' discarded uniform items and held them out to him. &quot;Valiant effort, truly.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You can skip one measly little Charms class,&quot; James whined. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;How would I explain that absence? Apologies, Flitwick, I was busy snogging my golden boy, I'm sure you understand,&quot; Regulus deadpanned. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James raised his eyebrows appreciatively. &quot;Honestly, I think ole Flitwick would respect it.&quot; Regulus shoved James with a nudge of his foot. &quot;Wait,&quot; James continued, &quot;Your golden boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The tips of Regulus' ears went pink, but he held his ground. He hopped off the counter and took James' tie from his hand, doing it up more swiftly than James had ever seen. Regulus Black everyone, annoyingly good at everything even when he wasn't trying to be. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you?&quot; he asked. &quot;Mine?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James wanted to taste the words on his tongue. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Before he could make a move, though, Regulus stalked out of the bathroom without another word, likely grinning to himself while also steadying his rapid heartbeat. James whispered, &quot;Fuck,&quot; to himself and splashed cold water on his face. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Twice. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He finished buttoning up his shirt and threw his robes on, deciding to skip glancing in the mirror. He knew he had the distinct look of someone who'd been thoroughly snogged, and he didn't care. No one had to know it was Regulus, but James liked the idea of people looking at him and seeing Regulus all over him. Lily would roll her eyes, and the other Marauders would have questions, but James was too lovestruck to be a bad liar at the moment. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He waited a few minutes before following Regulus out, though the map had told him no one was around. He did it as a courtesy, just in case. And because strolling into Transfiguration fashionably late was simply a part of his daily routine. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sirius nodded at him when he showed up, lost in conversation with Peter about something James was sure he'd hear about later. Remus was laid up in the post-moon hospital wing, which was probably for the best, because he didn't need to see Remus' look of disapproval at the wrinkled state of his shirt and his mussed up hair. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Remus had remained mum about the whole situation, not even bothering to inquire about it further with James on his own, though he surely wanted to. Maybe he was waiting for James to come to him. He would, he probably should have right after Remus caught the two of them together, but for now he'd let it lie. No reason to have Remus talk sense into him about telling Sirius when he was doing such a good job at avoiding the topic so far. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James slipped into the seat beside Marlene since Sirius and Peter were still talking and Mary and Lily were sitting together. She gave him a smile in greeting, then did a sharp double take. Damn, Regulus must have really messed him up good. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you...?&quot; she trailed off, then shook her head. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He furrowed his brows. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What the bloody hell have you got that tie on for?&quot; Sirius asked, finally turning around towards him. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Had Regulus messed up tying it properly? He was about to ask what Sirius meant by that when he glanced down and-- oh. Oh shit. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How had neither one of them realized they were wearing each other's ties? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James blinked, like that would magically correct it, but no. Where red and gold usually sat was silver and green. It even smelled like him. Oh, god, was Sirius going to be able to smell it too and figure it out?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You were wearing the right tie before you ditched us in History,&quot; Peter noted, unhelpfully. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right,&quot; Sirius agreed, cocking his head to one side. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Prank,&quot; James said, and Marlene snorted at his side. She didn't <br />
<br />
know<br />
<br />
, but James had a feeling she knew something. He gave her a swift kick under the table. He wasn't the only one dating a Slytherin, after all. Everyone knew all about her and Dorcas Meadowes. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sirius considered him. &quot;I'd believe you if you didn't look like someone just fucked the life out of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kudos, Regulus. All they'd done was kiss. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Your secret girlfriend is a Slytherin?&quot; Peter gasped loudly. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't have a secret girlfriend,&quot; James said, words coming easily because he wasn't technically lying. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Marlene snorted again. Ok, she definitely knew too. Blimey, did everyone? Except Sirius and Peter, apparently. James really didn't care in all honesty, he sometimes thought he wanted the entire world to know, but he would keep things low key as long as Regulus needed. They didn't have to shout anything from the rooftops, even if that was James' go to. Change could be a good thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Or a boyfriend,&quot; Sirius said, narrowing his eyes. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You've got me,&quot; James said with an exaggerated sigh, &quot;I'm sleeping with Snivellus.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The suspicion on Sirius' face cleared in an instant. &quot;Wanker.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;How'd you know my pet name for him?&quot; James cooed, and Sirius and Peter crowed with laughter. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
McGonagall, from the front of the room, swished her wand to shut them up. James was so used to it by this point that he took advantage of the silence to shout, &quot;I'm in love with Regulus Black!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing came out except for air, as per usual with the silencing charm, but James smiled to himself regardless. He ran the silky tie through his fingers and resisted the urge to bring it to his nose once more, inhaling the scent that embedded itself into his pillows, his jumpers, his bones. Sirius had even asked if he was using a new shampoo, for all that he and Regulus smelled like one another these days. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I will be scouring the Slytherin table for a Gryffindor tie, just so you know,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Sirius wrote on a piece of paper and slipped it to him. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Best of luck!! <br />
<br />
James wrote back. He knew Regulus wouldn't be stupid enough to wear the tie to dinner, but he hoped that he kept it, and that he couldn't get enough of its scent either.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He's going to fucking kill you,&quot; Marlene murmured to him under her breath as James felt the silencing spell wearing off. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He wasn't sure if she meant Regulus or Sirius, but regardless of her intent, he smirked and said, &quot;Cheers.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Later that night, at dinner, which James had corrected his tie for, folding Regulus' carefully into the drawer beside his bed, all the Slytherins were craning their neck towards the Gryffindor table, as the Gryffindors were doing the same to them. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus, tieless in his seat, met James' eyes across the hall and shook his head with something that looked like fondness. Sirius, oblivious to James' right, simply asked James to pass the pudding, not noticing that his brother was the only Slytherin without a tie. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
iv.<br />
<br />
<br />
Somehow, Regulus and James had convinced Sirius that they hated each other. It wasn't James' fault that he'd thrown the quaffle at Regulus during the Gryffindor versus Slytherin match (landing him a penalty), it was Regulus' fault for taunting him from across the pitch. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It had been a thrown quaffle of love, but of course no one knew that but the two of them. Regulus had started crying; he'd laughed so hard after the match. And yes, it was incredibly endearing, but it didn't soothe the sting of Slytherin beating them. Regulus was easily the most talented seeker James had ever seen-- in his totally unbiased opinion-- so it had probably been a doomed match from the start, but Gryffindor had only lost by ten points in the end, so at least James had pulled his weight the rest of the way. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus had been quick to point out that if James had gone for a goal instead of throwing the quaffle at him, they might have won, which was very much not the encouragement he needed to hear, but coming from Regulus it didn't sound so bad. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Sirius had reamed James out later, once he'd gotten back to the common room. At first, he'd been extremely confused, having just spent the last hour making out with Regulus, but then he remembered and had to fight to retain a neutral expression.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He had to say, he thought it was sweet to see Sirius protective over Regulus again. They didn't hang out too much, but they tried for once a week if they could, and though Sirius and Regulus had both told James that it was awkward as hell at first, things were getting better day by day. Sirius had offhandedly mentioned inviting Regulus to the next party they had, and Remus and James had met each other's shocked expressions over Sirius' head.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James had expected Sirius' stern words to be the end of it, forgotten about in the morning, but Sirius surprised him by dragging him out of bed and down to the Great Hall for breakfast, sitting him down, then going to drag Regulus over to their table as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regulus looked panicked, and James tried to convey that Sirius didn't know about them, he actually thought the opposite. Based on Regulus' darting eyes, he did a poor job. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Prongs, apologize,&quot; Sirius said stubbornly. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lily and Remus, who were already sitting at the table together, had their heads huddled together. James knew exactly what they were talking about, and he was unamused. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sirius, I was the one who--&quot; Regulus started, and James cut him off before he could say anything damning. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;--threatened to throw a quaffle at me first,&quot; James said, widening his eyes once more for effect. Regulus furrowed his brows, but followed James' lead. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;He's right,&quot; he said, &quot;I just didn't think he'd have the balls to follow up on my threat.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Very funny, Reg. It took every ounce of James' self control to not make some sort of sex joke, because he knew hiding their relationship would be a lost cause after that. Even Sirius couldn't be that oblivious. &quot;To be fair, I wasn't actually trying to hit him,&quot; James said to Sirius.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have to pretend to save face, Potter, I know your aim is just that poor,&quot; Regulus said. When he said Potter, he meant Jamie, and James heard it loud and clear.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
His smile was genuine, and he tried to morph it into something more like a smirk. &quot;I'd worry more about your teammates' aim. If you hadn't caught the snitch, the loss would have been embarrassingly bad.&quot; That much was true. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I hear a compliment in there somewhere?&quot; Regulus asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;In your dreams.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright!&quot; Sirius clapped his hands. &quot;That's enough of that. Quidditch is over for the season, so there's no reason to hate one another, right</td>

<br />
&quot;You're squinting again.&quot; The touch on Arthur's shoulder is gentle, but it makes him jump all the same, coming as it does when he's deep into the second paragraph of tomorrow's speech. He looks up to find Merlin watching him, a half smile on his face that speaks to equal parts affection and exasperation. &quot;You know you should use more candles if you're going to be working late; you'll ruin your eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Night has crept up on him, it seems, as it has done so often in recent months. Arthur can't remember the last time he paused to take a breath, but he's fairly certain it must have been before his father died. Stretching wearily, he works the kinks out of his neck and watches his manservant light some extra candles with a wave of his hand, floating them over to cluster on the desk in front of him. How long has he been sitting here, anyway? Hours at the very least, hunched over a sheaf of parchment like a miserable monk. He'll be growing a hump like Geoffrey's next, and pinching his eyes the way his old nanny used to do behind her glasses. The pressures of being king are turning him into an old man. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rough day?&quot; Merlin asks quietly. He takes half a step away from the desk, his hands clasped awkwardly behind his back; no matter how many times Arthur has told him to relax, he still gets self-conscious sometimes when performing magic--he claims that the sight of it makes Arthur nervous. &quot;You seem tense.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No more than usual.&quot; Arthur rubs at his forehead. &quot;But I have to admit, I'll be glad when all of these formalities are over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin makes a humming sound. &quot;I did warn you that it was going to be a lot of work,&quot; he says, more disapproving than commiserating. &quot;You could just have issued the proclamation and had done with it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;And miss out on all this entertainment?&quot; Arthur gestures at his desk overflowing with parchment. &quot;Never. Besides, Geoffrey was right.&quot; Not a phrase he finds himself using very often. &quot;Justice must not only be done but it must be seen to be done. It's the only way I can even begin to make this work.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin doesn't say anything for a long moment, and when he does speak it's only to cast an enchantment on the covers of Arthur's bed, folding the corner of the blankets down invitingly. Arthur shifts in his seat. Perhaps the magic does make him uncomfortable, though not for the reasons that Merlin thinks. He has always found Merlin's eyes disconcertingly attractive, and when they flare gold like that... <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on, then,&quot; Merlin says, tipping his head towards the mattress. &quot;I'll finish up for you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Blinking slightly, Arthur shakes himself out of his reverie. &quot;Finish up what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your speech.&quot; Merlin rolls his eyes. &quot;Its obvious you're so tired you can barely think straight, and I know what a challenge that is for you at the best of times.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheeky,&quot; Arthur says, but there's no bite to it. He is tired, so tired that keeping his mind on-task is clearly becoming a challenge, and his temples ache. &quot;And who's going to undress me while you're busy doing that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid you'll have to do that part yourself, sire,&quot; Merlin replies, with mock dismay that doesn't fool Arthur for a moment. &quot;Unless you'd rather I send for George, of course; I'm sure he'd be more than happy to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur had been hoping that Merlin would offer to do it himself, perhaps by using his magic again--but in hindsight that would probably cause more problems than it solved. &quot;No, I think I can manage,&quot; he says, pushing back his chair. He ruffles Merlin hair as he passes, smirking at his manservant's feeble attempts to bat him away, then sits down on his bed and toes off his boots, pulling his shirt off over his head as he does so.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin, being Merlin, has helpfully ensured that Arthur's sleeping shift is hooked on the changing screen halfway across the room, and for a moment Arthur contemplates the distance between himself and it and wonders whether there is honestly any point in going over to retrieve it. Summer isn't really in full swing yet, but his chambers have collected enough residual warmth that he likely won't feel the lack until early morning, at which point he will be ready to start getting up anyway. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Before he can make up his mind one way or the other, the sleeping shirt twitches, and in another moment it is flying through the air, soaring between his grasping hands to smack him in the face. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Merlin,&quot; Arthur says, disentangling himself. &quot;That was very thoughtful of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy to help, my lord,&quot; Merlin says cheerily, turning over another page. He hasn't even bothered to look up. &quot;All in a day's work.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur shakes his head, pulling the shift on and then discarding his belt and trousers. It feels odd to be undressing without Merlin to attend him, and even odder still to be half naked and getting ready for sleep with his manservant otherwise occupied across the room. All things considered, the situation is rather too close to some of his more embarrassing fantasies for the silence to be comfortable, and he gropes for something to say that will relieve the tension.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; he says, padding over to his bedside cabinet. He pours some water into the ewer and begins to wash his face. &quot;I never did ask how a peasant boy from Ealdor came to read and write so well.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He can almost hear Merlin's smile. &quot;What's the matter, sire--are you worried I'll make you look bad in front of the court?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Merlin would never screw up something so important to both of them; of that Arthur has no doubt. &quot;Just curious. You must admit, it's rather unusual.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;My mother was an unusual woman.&quot; For a moment, Merlin's voice turns wistful, and Arthur hears the scratching of his quill pause mid-stroke. Hunith had been killed two winters before, cut down by a Saxon raiding party that had broken through Cenred's borders, and Arthur knows that Merlin still feels guilty for not being able to save her. They both do, despite the fact that the failure had been no one's fault. &quot;She learned from her father when she was a girl, and so she passed it on to me. She always said that an education was more important than a sword.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;And safer, perhaps,&quot; Arthur says, trying to coax the smile back, &quot;given your appalling lack of physical skills.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;My physical skills are just fine,&quot; Merlin says, and this time Arthur is fairly sure he isn't imagining the amusement in Merlin's tone. He looks over, but Merlin is angled away from him, studying the parchment with a blandly innocent air. &quot;It's just that some of us prefer to fight with our brains rather than our biceps.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur snorts. &quot;Touche,&quot; he says. &quot;Although it would help if some of us had biceps to begin with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
His ablutions completed, the king remains standing for a moment to watch Merlin work, taking in the bent head, the teeth chewing absently on the tip of his quill where it rests against his lower lip. He can tell when Merlin reaches the most recent addition to his speech because his expression changes, going from concentrated attention to shock to something else that Arthur isn't entirely sure how to interpret. He had been intending to keep the full extent of his gift a secret until the morning, the better to enjoy Merlin's surprise when he discovered exactly what Arthur had in mind, but perhaps it is as well to do the thing in private. Lord knows what effect it would have on Merlin's demonstration if he were to be distracted by feelings while attempting to work some complicated magic. It would be safer for everyone involved if he were to minimise the risk. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And maybe, too, it's safer for Arthur's sanity that they're alone, without an audience, so that there is no one from whom he has to hide his thoughts except for Merlin himself--a man from whom Arthur has long ago stopped trying to hide anything of any real importance. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arthur.&quot; Merlin's voice, when he finds it, is rough and slightly shaken, his fingers trembling a little where they brush over the paper. &quot;This--this isn't what we talked about.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought I might as well do the thing properly,&quot; Arthur says, shrugging. He's aware of the throb of his heartbeat at the base of his throat, the crush of pressure in his chest. It's so very important for Merlin to understand why Arthur has done this. Please let Merlin understand why he's done this. &quot;My father hurt a great many people with his actions, but when I was drawing up the official papers for your position, I realised...well, I hoped that this might go some way towards repairing the harm he did, to you and to your family.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It does more than that,&quot; Merlin says, shaking his head. &quot;This is--Arthur, thank you, I--why didn't you tell me before?&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn't entirely sure you would appreciate it,&quot; Arthur admits, crossing back to his bed and climbing under the covers. The sheets are cool and crisp, the perfect temperature for a night like this one. He suspects that this, too, is probably sorcery. &quot;The Dragonlord title comes with a lot of responsibility; you might have tried to talk me out of it. I thought perhaps it would be better not to give you the choice.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You thought I'd turn it down. You thought I'd turn this down.&quot; He shakes the parchment for emphasis, widening his eyes, and Arthur makes a face.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're very unpredictable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you're an idiot, sire,&quot; Merlin replies, but the thickness in his voice says something else entirely, and Arthur turns his head into the pillow and settles in to sleep, only peripherally aware of the smile still softening his mouth.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
+<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The next morning is too busy for more than the briefest of pleasantries between them; Merlin, to Arthur's certain knowledge, must have been up with the birds, but he puts off waking the king until the last possible moment, claiming it is the only way to keep Arthur from fretting.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, you needed the rest,&quot; he adds firmly, ignoring Arthur's half-hearted attempts to berate him. He prods Arthur into his court robes, runs a comb and then absent-minded fingers through his hair, and shoves a scroll of parchment into his hand, gesturing for him to read it. &quot;Your speech, sire, as requested,&quot; he says. &quot;I only had to change a few paragraphs this time. I think you're starting to get the hang of this whole talking to people thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very funny,&quot; Arthur says drily, taking the scroll without unrolling it. &quot;Did you add another section congratulating King Cenred on his backside full of pustulant boils? I thought that was very inventive of you, last time. Especially the way you worked it into my speech about the harvest like that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never,&quot; Merlin says, which is a lie and they both know it. &quot;I have nothing but respect for King Cenred. Now let me go,&quot; for Arthur had caught hold of his wrist, keeping him in place as he turned to leave, &quot;There's still a ridiculous amount to do, and I need to have a word with the cook about the sweetmeats. Arthur.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But Arthur doesn't let go, not wanting him to vanish again just yet. &quot;Merlin. Thank you,&quot; he says seriously, meeting the familiar blue gaze with his own. &quot;For everything. But you do know you're allowed to have some fun today, too, right? This is as much your achievement as it is mine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin favours him with a tiny smile, some of the tension going out of his stance as he exhales. &quot;I know,&quot; he says, shrugging his shoulders. &quot;But I like having something to do. It's what I'm used to, and it keeps me from getting nervous.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You? Nervous?&quot; Arthur raises his eyebrows. &quot;We've been planning this whole thing for months. What could you possibly have to be nervous about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Merlin says darkly. &quot;That's what I'm afraid of.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
With this unsettling pronouncement, he takes his leave, and Arthur makes his way down to the Great Hall alone, passing a veritable army of servants and liveried underlings as he goes. The castle is like an overturned ant-hill, swarming with all kinds of bustle and activity, and Arthur's progression hardly draws so much as a second glance as he passes down the main staircase and into the audience chamber. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Like the rest of the castle, the Throne Room has been heavily decorated for the day's festivities. The throne itself has been polished to a shine, the floors thick with newly laid rushes, and the rear wall is adorned with an enormous tapestry emblazoned with a massive version of the Pendragon crest. The gilt-edged animal dominates the room, and Arthur pauses for a moment to look at it, his footsteps slowing on their path towards the antechamber at the other end of the Hall.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He has no doubt that his father would be turning over in his grave if he knew what Arthur was about to do. Balinor had been his sworn enemy, and Merlin is one of the greatest sorcerers who has ever lived, not to mention a Dragonlord into the bargain. Honouring either of them for any reason would have been anathema to Uther, no matter how many times Merlin had saved his son's life, and Arthur has gone even further than that; if all goes well this morning, Arthur will soon be changing a law that has stood for decades, acknowledging the very real contributions that magic has made to the safety of his kingdom. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, Father,&quot; he murmurs, touching the back of the throne with one hand. &quot;But you were the one who taught me to have the courage of my convictions, even if you had no idea what those convictions would be. In a way, this entire thing is all your fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There is, of course, no response, but Arthur fancies he can hear a sigh--disappointment and resignation both, a not infrequent sound that he had often heard issuing from Uther's lips. He shakes his head at himself. First last night, now this. He really is getting old.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
+<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Inside the antechamber, the group of knights that make up the King's Guard are waiting for him, all of them impeccably turned out in parade armour and habitual deep red cloaks. They all turn when Arthur approaches, looking mildly relieved to find him arriving on time.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, sire,&quot; Leon says, raising a hand in greeting. &quot;We were beginning to think you might be late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very late,&quot; Gwaine agrees, smirking. &quot;Aren't you supposed to be with Merlin, helping him get ready for the big day?&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've barely seen him all morning,&quot; Arthur admits, trying not to let on just how irritating he finds this fact. From the amused look on Sir Gwaine's face, he's not entirely successful. &quot;He's been rushing about like a flea in a fit, even though I've told him enough times that he doesn't have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's excited, I expect,&quot; Leon says sagely. &quot;It's not every day a sorcerer becomes a knight of the realm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically, he's becoming a mage of the realm,&quot; Arthur corrects him; he hadn't invented the whole damn hierarchy just so that people could go around ignoring it willy-nilly. &quot;And he's not the only one. Mordred's being honoured today, too, and he's not going around bewailing the state of the castle's curtains.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Leon and Percival exchange glances in front of him, their eyebrows raised; Gwaine is outright grinning, showing far too many teeth for Arthur's peace of mind. Even Elyan looks hard-pressed to swallow his smile, and Arthur can usually count on him to be the sensible one. He narrows his eyes. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why are you all looking at me like that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;We just think it's cute, is all,&quot; Gwaine says, patting Arthur on the shoulder. &quot;The way you're trying to pretend you didn't organise this whole thing as an excuse to shower Merlin with attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Arthur repeats, more strenuously this time. &quot;That's--this is--that's not what this is about.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Leon says, sounding unconvinced. Percival nods behind him, straight-faced and solemn as ever, and Elyan makes a polite sound of acknowledgement at the back of his throat. None of them seem remotely persuaded by Arthur's denial.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn't!&quot; Arthur protests. He gets the feeling that he's fighting a losing battle here, especially since he's not sure he believes what he is saying himself, but never let it be said that Arthur Pendragon has ever backed down from a challenge. &quot;This is about lifting the ban on magic, making it clear that I'm serious about undoing the wrongs of the past. This has nothing whatsoever to do with Merlin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it doesn't,&quot; Leon says soothingly. &quot;It's just that--well. You did decide to appoint him First Mage of Camelot--&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;--and he is the first sorcerer to act openly in your service--&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;--and you are reinstating the Dragonlord title wholly for his benefit--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;--so you might as well admit it, sire,&quot; Gwaine concludes, grinning. &quot;We all know you'd give away half your kingdom just to see Merlin smile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur's cheeks are hot. &quot;Don't be ridiculous,&quot; he says, fighting the urge to scowl. &quot;Merlin is an old friend and a trusted advisor; he means no more and no less to me than he does to any of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At that moment, the door to the antechamber swings open and Merlin himself stumbles in, his fastenings askew and his face flushed from hurrying. He's wearing Pendragon colours today, a newly commissioned cloak of bright scarlet fastened around his neck, setting off his dark hair and the colour of his eyes, and the gold embroidered thread of the dragon at his chest makes Arthur think, inevitably, of magic. It's the first time Arthur has seen him in his official robes, Merlin having flatly refused to change into them until the last possible moment, and although he had been intending to add more to his little speech--something biting about the perils of rumour mills and gossip-mongering--he finds that he has been temporarily struck dumb by his manservant's appearance. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I'm late,&quot; Merlin says, hurrying towards them. &quot;The cook was having a minor crisis and one of the maids may have accidentally set one of the centrepieces on fire. I say may have because, honestly, I'm not sure how it could have been an accident, but then again--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand still,&quot; Arthur tells him, recovering in the face of this inane chatter and reaching out to take his manservant by the shoulders. He re-settles Merlin's jacket with impatient hands, smoothing it over his chest and re-fastening the ties that have come loose along his front. Merlin is vibrating with pent-up energy, like a hunting dog cooped up in its kennel for far too long, but he stops bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet and lets Arthur fix his cloak for him, bright eyed with excitement and anticipation. Whatever Merlin might say to the contrary, Arthur knows that he loves the ridiculous pageantry of these official court functions almost as much as Arthur despises them, which--regardless of what he'd just told Gwaine and the others--is pretty much the only reason he hadn't vetoed the whole idea the moment Geoffrey had suggested it. That, and he would never pass up a chance to see Merlin like this, wearing Arthur's colours and with his sigil emblazoned across his chest for all to see. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;There,&quot; Arthur says finally, stepping back. &quot;You look presentable, at least. I told you you should have woken me earlier; if you hadn't been busy trying to do everyone's job except your own, you'd have been able to get yourself ready on time like a normal person.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gee, thanks.&quot; Merlin's nose crinkles as he smiles. &quot;It's nice to know my efforts are appreciated.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, they're appreciated all right,&quot; Gwaine assures him over Arthur's shoulder. &quot;Arthur appreciates you a great deal, don't you, Arthur?&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was just telling us how much,&quot; Leon agrees, and Arthur wonders whether anyone would object if he were to lock up four of his most celebrated knights for treason. &quot;And we all think you're very impressive.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do?&quot; Merlin looks at Arthur, and the surprised pleasure in his eyes is enough to make the king rethink what he'd been about to say. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, well. I'd appreciate it even more if you were tidy.&quot; Arthur plucks a strand of charred fabric from Merlin's hair. &quot;What was that about not screwing things up on our big day?&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin flushes and looks down, his smile turning a trifle sheepish, and Arthur's heart, treacherous organ that it is, flops over foolishly in his chest and threatens to secede. &quot;I told you, there was an issue with one of the centrepieces. It really wasn't my fault.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most things aren't,&quot; Arthur says, shaking his head. Behind them, Gaius appears in the doorway, gesturing frantically for his nephew to join him, and Arthur tips his head in the old man's direction. &quot;There's your cue,&quot; he says, turning Merlin bodily and giving him a little push. &quot;Your Lordship. Do try not to set anything else on fire before the ceremony starts.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you promise to refrain from being a prat,&quot; Merlin retorts, and then hurries off before Arthur can retaliate. Not for the first time, Arthur wishes he'd had the courage to lean over and kiss him in front of everyone, protocols be damned. But there will be time enough to negotiate that particular hurdle later on, once he has seen Merlin safely installed to the position that is his due.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur looks over at his knights, who are staring pointedly back at him, sceptics to a man.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; he concedes, giving up. &quot;Maybe a third of the kingdom. But only because he's earned it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
+<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Despite Merlin's dire predictions, the ceremony goes off without a hitch. There are no unexpected magical attacks or disasters, and no unnecessary insults have been scrawled in the margins of Arthur's speech that threaten to make him laugh at inappropriate moments. Instead, his voice rings out clear and strong over the assembled court, rescinding his father's ban on magic and ending the persecution of magic-users for good.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Afterwards, he remembers the day as a series of small moments. There is the slight sting at his heart when he catches sight of Guinevere amidst the crowd, her face radiant with happiness as she cheers loudly for her friend. Beside her, Lancelot looks, if possible, even happier, his armour shining so brightly that it has to have been polished with magic. The knight has one arm wrapped around his wife's shoulders, and he nods hesitantly at the king when their eyes meet, his smile faltering for just a moment under Arthur's frowning gaze. Winning the heart of Arthur's former love is one thing, but Arthur has yet to entirely forgive him for learning of Merlin's secret before he did, and Lancelot knows it. Still, it is Arthur who helped to make today happen, not Lance, and after so many years the king supposes he can be generous. He nods back, watching Lancelot's face light up, and feels for just a moment the singular pleasure of laying an old ghost to rest. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And then, of course, there is Merlin himself. Apparently taking his cue from Arthur's last-minute script change, instead of the butterflies they had agreed to he conjures a huge, glittering dragon for his demonstration, nearly giving the onlookers a collective heart attack. The great beast makes one circuit of the hall and then descends onto the dais, lowering its head to bow in front of the king, and after an instant of confusion Arthur bows back, sending the dragon shattering into thousands of tiny stars. The look on Merlin's face as the chamber erupts into tumultuous applause is one that Arthur will treasure for the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At length, after the feasting and speechmaking are done, Arthur makes his excuses and slips away, climbing the staircase to his rooms alone for the first time since he was woken that morning. His rooms are dark, none of the servants having had the time to light the candles or see to the fire, and for a few minutes he just stands there, listening to the sounds of revelry travelling up from below. This is what it feels like, he realises, to have achieved something momentous, something that will be remembered for generations to come. It is a good feeling, but an oddly lonely one.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sire?&quot; He turns, and of course there's Merlin, standing flush-cheeked and uncertain on the threshold behind him. &quot;I noticed you left the celebrations early, and I thought--well. Are you all right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just tired,&quot; Arthur says, although that's not entirely true. &quot;I needed some space to breathe.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin laughs softly, coming further into the room and closing the door behind him. &quot;It's all a bit overwhelming, isn't it? I wasn't expecting...I mean, I thought the people would be more resistant.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur smiles a little--he, on the other hand, had expected precisely this response, but then Merlin has always been ridiculously unaware of how much the kingdom loves him.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking about Morgana,&quot; he says, tugging at the fastenings of his cloak. &quot;I wish--that is, it would have been nice if she had come back to Camelot for the ceremony.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give her time, sire,&quot; Merlin says. &quot;Once she sees that you can be trusted, she'll reach out. I know she will.&quot; He takes a step forward, pushing away Arthur's hands where they are tangled with the clasp. &quot;Here, let me. It's still my job, after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
That had been the one point of contention between them this past week, and indeed since Arthur announced his plans to give Merlin a promotion: Merlin had flat-out refused to give up his old job as Arthur's manservant, despite Arthur's strident protestations.  <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't have the First Mage of Camelot serving in my bedchamber,&quot; Arthur had said, trying to be reasonable. &quot;You must see that. What will the Council say?&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, let me think.&quot; Merlin pretended to consider. &quot;That you're a pompous dollophead who can't drag himself out of bed in the morning? That you're a grown man who still can't get dressed on his own?&quot; He spread his hands, shrugging broadly. &quot;I don't know, sire. You know how these rumours travel.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Eventually, Arthur had given in, and now, with Merlin puttering around, hanging up his cloak and fussing over the unlit sconces, he is selfishly glad of it, this small oasis of normalcy between them when so many other things have changed. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think I did the right thing?&quot; he asks, surprising himself as much as Merlin with the words. &quot;Today, I mean. Was it enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was everything,&quot; Merlin says seriously, abandoning the fireplace to come and help Arthur to undress. He kneels at Arthur's feet, unlacing his boots, and looks up at him earnestly through his lashes with an expression that steals Arthur's breath. &quot;I know you wanted to do more, but I understand why you need to take things slowly. And--pardoning my father, removing the death penalty as punishment for magic--Arthur, what you did today was no small thing.&quot; He sets Arthur's boots aside and scoots closer, peeling off Arthur's socks without his usual theatrical grimace of distaste. As always, his hands on Arthur's skin are warm and gentle, pressing down on the tops of his feet in a strangely reverent gesture. &quot;You are destined to be a great king, Arthur, I truly believe that. Even more so after what I saw today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He straightens and makes to stand up, but Arthur stills him with a touch, taking hold of Merlin's chin between thumb and forefinger and tipping it towards him. Apart from his sister's presence, there is only one thing missing that would make the day's triumph complete, and he wonders if he dares to reach for that, also.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not so sure,&quot; he says softly, and feels Merlin's shiver under his hand. &quot;I didn't do any of this because of destiny, you know. I didn't even do it for Camelot--at least, not entirely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin swallows visibly, his Adam's apple bobbing along his pale throat, but he doesn't say anything. Arthur leans closer, seeking out Merlin's gaze and meeting it squarely. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you want to know why I did it? Or rather, who I did it for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arthur.&quot; The word is half a laugh, half a plea. &quot;Sire. I wouldn't want to presume--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You presume a lot of things where no one else would,&quot; Arthur points out. &quot;Why not this?&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin doesn't answer, and Arthur thinks back to his own doubts these past few weeks. Why not this? Because he is the king; because of his father; because no matter what he does, now or in the future, there are words and deeds in Arthur's past that he will regret for the rest of his life. Because, underneath all of that, he's just a man, perhaps not even a very good one, and he has nothing in particular to offer Merlin that he can't already achieve for himself. But Merlin knows all this, and he's still here, uncharacteristically tongue-tied by the touch of Arthur's fingers, and this time Arthur finds that perhaps it doesn't take courage to kiss him after all. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Were it anyone else, anyone but Merlin, he might have paused first, anxious to make sure that this was more than some kind of imposition or duty. But Merlin is no mere servant and never has been; to believe he could ever be cowed by such trivial things as rank and custom would have been an insult to them both. Arthur doesn't waver, and after a moment, neither does Merlin, surging up into the kiss with his hands on Arthur's thighs, his mouth opening hot and deep beneath Arthur's own. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;The truth is, I was kind of afraid to mention it,&quot; he whispers, when they pause to breathe. &quot;You've given me so much already--it seemed greedy to ask for more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have to ask, you idiot,&quot; Arthur whispers back, holding him close. &quot;I'm already yours.&quot;<br />

            <td class="column21 style0 s">Right after the stagehand signals five minutes, Gen feels his phone vibrate in his back pocket.<br />
<br />
Unsure who would be texting him other than his manager, who's waiting in the green room, Gen pulls it out quickly, unlocking the screen. It's from an unknown number.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bohr says I'm right.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Followed by a link.<br />
<br />
Eyebrows raised, Gen taps the link. After a second of buffering, his phone browser pulls up a page that Gen recognizes as some sort of scientific article about quantum physics. He catches sight of the terms matter wave nature and observer effect before his eyes glaze over and he switches back to the messaging app.<br />
<br />
Normally, he'd just ignore the message and block the number, like he does when fans occasionally get a hold of his personal information, but something about the sheer confidence of the message intrigues him and before he can stop himself, he's tapping out a response.<br />
<br />
<br />
From what I can tell, this Bohr person is dead and can't weigh in on any personal arguments. One of several mistakes you've made today ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
His phone buzzes with a response before he can even put it back in his pocket.<br />
<br />
<br />
You know that's not what I mean, old man. The observer effect and the uncertainty principle are different, period. I'm trying to help you study, so take this seriously.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, Gen starts typing again. Clearly, he's been accidentally contacted by some sort of science nerd and he really needs to cut that off at the pass.<br />
<br />
<br />
I should have been clearer: you've got the wrong number.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, the response comes quickly:<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't try that on me again. I'm not falling for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In his periphery, Gen sees the stagehand signaling two minutes, but he keeps frowning down at his phone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't be so pushy. No one likes an aggressive guy, you know.<br />
<br />
Stop trying to distract me from the fact that you were wrong.<br />
<br />
What exactly was I wrong about?<br />
<br />
Do I really need to spell it out for you? Fine, fine. After you were so INSISTENT about Heisenberg's work, I took the liberty of tracking down these materials for you so that you don't make such an embarrassing mistake on your selection exam. No need to thank me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen can't help but snort at the gall. Who talks like this? Other than him, that is.<br />
<br />
&quot;Asagiri-san,&quot; the stagehand whispers loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming, coming,&quot; Gen sings, powering his phone off and tucking it back in his pocket. Let his unaware friend talk to themselves for a while.<br />
<br />
He's still smiling as he parts the curtains with aplomb to begin his act.<br />
<br />
When Gen checks his phone later, after letting himself into his empty apartment, still flushed with energy from a successful show, he's tickled to find eight missed notifications.<br />
<br />
Most of them are paragraphs of technical-sounding jargon that Gen can barely parse, interspersed with fond-sounding insults and links to increasingly esoteric articles.<br />
<br />
Flopping down on his sofa, Gen responds:<br />
<br />
<br />
That's ~fascinating~ and all, but I was serious earlier. If you want your wayward student to pass his exam, you should try texting him instead, sensei.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This time, Gen has time to run a hand over his tired eyes and consider going to bed before the reply comes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hang on, you're not joking?<br />
<br />
Nope~ double-check the number.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another few minutes pass, during which Gen assumes his mystery texter is cross-referencing his contacts. Then--<br />
<br />
<br />
I apologize for that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen snorts.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's okay~ it's not every day I get mysterious, passionate texts about science.<br />
<br />
You didn't have to let me just keep rambling.<br />
<br />
I tried to tell you, sensei.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I guess you did.<br />
<br />
Tsk tsk. You should trust people more.<br />
<br />
<br />
To be fair, my father has tried that on me before to get out of studying.<br />
<br />
To his own son? How cold~<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After hitting send, Gen realizes he just assumed his mystery texter was male and quickly amends:<br />
<br />
<br />
*child<br />
<br />
No, son is correct.<br />
<br />
Well, you sound like quite the taskmaster, so I guess I can't blame him. What is he studying for?<br />
<br />
Or not studying, as the case may be.<br />
<br />
He's trying to get selected for a manned mission to the International Space Station.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen raises his eyebrows, stretching out on the sofa.<br />
<br />
<br />
And you're helping him?<br />
<br />
He needs the help. He's a physics professor, but if he can't even tell the difference between the observer effect and the uncertainty principle, then he'll never pass the preliminary selection.<br />
<br />
Of course, of course.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen has almost no idea what those words mean.<br />
<br />
<br />
You certainly know a lot. Are you a professor too?<br />
<br />
Fishing for information?<br />
<br />
Are you saying you don't trust me?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I don't know you.<br />
<br />
I don't know you either.<br />
<br />
Fine then. I'll tell you what I do if you tell me what you do.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen considers for a second, tapping a finger against his lips. Basic stranger danger insists he not divulge personal information to a complete stranger over text message, but there's something oddly charming about his new texting buddy. What harm can a little polite conversation do?<br />
<br />
(And it's not like he has anyone else texting him.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Deal. I'm a performer~<br />
<br />
A performer of what?<br />
<br />
Sorry~ can't tell you that. I'm getting fairly well-known. If I tell you what I perform, you might be able to track me down and murder me.<br />
<br />
That's fair. You do seem pretty irritating. I'm not sure I'd be able to help myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen cackles, rolling over on his side.<br />
<br />
<br />
How cruel!<br />
<br />
It's better to be safe.<br />
<br />
Your turn, sensei.<br />
<br />
I'm a student.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So not a sensei. The title still seems apt, somehow. Gen takes a second to change the unknown number's contact name to Sensei before responding:<br />
<br />
<br />
What's your major?<br />
<br />
I'm in high school.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen's eyes widen.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're not!!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I am.<br />
<br />
Seeeriously?? You must be very precocious for your age.<br />
<br />
Okay, I'm not twelve. Quantum mechanics and particle wave research are well within high school curriculum.<br />
<br />
But helping someone study for a space program selection exam surely isn't.<br />
<br />
It's really not that impressive.<br />
<br />
No need to be modest!! I'm your fan, sensei~<br />
<br />
Oh, great. The wrong number I texted and lectured about Niels Bohr is cheering me on.<br />
<br />
You're definitely younger than me and I barely understood any of what you sent me earlier. Of course I'm impressed~<br />
<br />
Please, that was nothing. It's actually very easy to understand once you know the basics.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This guy wants to explain, Gen realizes. He smiles. It's not like he had plans for the evening.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm afraid I wasn't a very good science student, sensei. Is it really that easy to understand?<br />
<br />
Anyone can pick it up. All you have to know is the fundamentals of particle physics, and that's easy stuff. So in 1925, a physicist named Erwin Schroedinger....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen sticks one of the couch pillows under his head and settles in.<br />
<br />
It shouldn't become a habit. Any sane person would laugh the whole thing off and stop talking to the guy who accidentally texted them about Niels Bohr, but Gen is nothing if not experimental. Every notification from Sensei makes him giddy. It's the same feeling he gets when he works a kink out of his act, or when a trick goes right for the first time.<br />
<br />
It's fun, in a way. Gen prides himself on being able to figure out how people tick, and a stranger he only communicates with via text is a unique challenge. He can't help testing this guy, or being delighted when Sensei tests him right back.<br />
<br />
From what he can tell, Sensei responds best to genuine-seeming curiosity and understated praise. He can pick out probing questions instantly and is uninterested in flattery, but he's eager to educate and responds well to certain kinds of compliments. It doesn't take Gen long to uncover Sensei's iron-clad ego, incredibly advanced for someone his age and solid enough to rival even Gen's, but it's obvious that Sensei isn't arrogant. Confident and audacious, sure, but he's the first to admit when he doesn't know something and seems honestly intrigued by Gen's knowledge of psychology.<br />
<br />
Chatting with Sensei quickly becomes Gen's favorite distraction. Perhaps he shouldn't be so eager to text someone several years younger, but it's not like either Gen or Sensei have any desire to meet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frued was a hack, of course, but he was the first to act on the concept of innate desires in his practice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen types, trying to keep his restless hands busy as he waits for his editor to arrive at their meeting spot. A publisher finally showed interest in his first book and he needs to make sure the draft is perfect before he sends it off.<br />
<br />
<br />
He was wrong about literally everything, though, and it's unfortunate that he's the face of modern psychology.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, the Oedipus complex guy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sensei goes through long periods of silence, but when he's in a talkative mood, he responds very quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Among other things. He pioneered psychoanalysis but his theories on the unconscious are all out of line. Did you know he popularized the concept of the libido?<br />
<br />
I didn't. That's a psychology thing?<br />
<br />
Of course! And it ruined the whole field of study for a long time. Almost everything he proposed has been disproven, but his work has pervaded the general public, so we'll never get rid of it. You've heard of Id, Ego, and Super-Ego?<br />
<br />
In passing.<br />
<br />
As if the human mind can be so easily compartmentalized.<br />
<br />
It's interesting to see you speak so scathingly about something.<br />
<br />
This is my wheelhouse, sensei~ it's kind of fun to know more about something than you.<br />
<br />
Psychology isn't something I need in my line of work.<br />
<br />
Don't be so hasty. You never know when you might need to get in someone's head.<br />
<br />
If I ever need to do that, I'll just call you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blinking down at his phone, Gen almost misses his editor sliding into the booth across from him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry sensei, my editor is here. Gtg!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And he puts his phone in his backpack and tries not to think about why he's blushing.<br />
<br />
When his meeting is over and he's nearly bouncing with excitement, he checks his phone again to find one new message.<br />
<br />
<br />
Editor? Are you a writer?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen curses internally. He'd been so caught up in his thoughts he didn't even notice the slip. That's just a little more information than he intended to share. He types slowly, biting his lip:<br />
<br />
<br />
In a manner of speaking.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sensei responds quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought you were a performer.<br />
<br />
I wear many hats. In this economy, it pays to diversify.<br />
<br />
It's nothing you'd be interested in, sensei. Trust me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The typing bubble pops up, ellipses rippling for a beat, then disappears. A moment passes before Sensei's reply comes:<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll take your word for it. That's pretty cool, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Relieved, Gen smiles.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you~ but don't be too nice, sensei. I'll get used to it~<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He almost adds a winky face but stops himself. A winky face is a big commitment. He needs to probe a little more to discover how Sensei feels about emojis before taking that step.<br />
<br />
<br />
Noted. And I looked into that guy we were talking about earlier. Even with my limited knowledge of psychology, I can tell you're right. He is a hack.<br />
<br />
Thank you!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that memetics isn't a legitimate field of study.<br />
<br />
You're just saying it's beneath you.<br />
<br />
No, I'm saying it's not as vital as other anthropological fields.<br />
<br />
What is anthropology if not the study of memes?<br />
<br />
Is that a joke?<br />
<br />
Me~? Joking~?<br />
<br />
Memetics in the modern day can't be compared to the study of things like art trends or linguistic analysis. That's just a fact.<br />
<br />
I disagree. It's social language, sensei! Doesn't sending a specific image to someone to denote a particular emotion ultimately serve the same purpose as hieroglyphics? In the 1700s it was common for painters to paint themselves posing in window frames. How is that not a meme?<br />
<br />
Art historians would disagree with you.<br />
<br />
Do you know any art historians?<br />
<br />
Do you? <br />
<br />
That's beside the point.<br />
<br />
Why don't you ask an art historian and get back to me.<br />
<br />
Why don't you ask Neils Bohr.<br />
<br />
Maybe I will.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Little gray box.<br />
<br />
Omg, are you texting me on a brick? You need an upgrade, sensei.<br />
<br />
It's funny--you're not the first person to tell me that today.<br />
<br />
Someone who does as much research as you needs a high-quality smartphone.<br />
<br />
Mine works just fine, thank you.<br />
<br />
Obviously not, if you can't see half of my adorable and super relevant emojis.<br />
<br />
Somehow I think I'll survive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I can see that one.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Leeches? Seeeeriously??<br />
<br />
Yeah, some hospitals still keep them.<br />
<br />
Ewww!!! Why?<br />
<br />
Nobody believes they suck out bad blood or anything. They have a really specific purpose.<br />
<br />
Ensuring that I never set foot in a hospital ever again?<br />
<br />
Yeah, and doctors will sometimes use them after reattaching a body part. If it's something small like a finger or toe and they act fast enough, severed pieces can be reattached without too much damage.<br />
<br />
Oh, that's good to know.<br />
<br />
Skilled surgeons can reconnect arteries, which carry blood from the heart to the limbs, but veins, which do the opposite, are smaller and harder to work with. So what happens is that blood flow can be reestablished to the severed part, but only in one direction, and since the limbs they're working with are usually really small, normal draining methods don't always work.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, to keep the limb from swelling with blood that has no way to get out, doctors will use leeches. They're small enough to only take a little blood and infection isn't a huge worry in such a sterile environment.<br />
<br />
Does the patient just have to stick leeches on themselves periodically for the rest of their life?<br />
<br />
Nah, the veins will grow back on their own after a while.<br />
<br />
That's pretty cool, sensei, but, no offense: <br />
<br />
If you're lucky, you'll never have to see it firsthand.<br />
<br />
Yeah, fingers crossed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No, Houdini didn't go to the seances because he believed in ghosts.<br />
<br />
Then why would he go?<br />
<br />
To disprove the mediums!!<br />
<br />
Wasn't he a magician?<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean he didn't value the truth! He worked hard on his illusions but he never claimed to have supernatural powers and he hated people who exploited the public with lies for money.<br />
<br />
You would have liked him, sensei. He was very methodical. He'd wait until he had definitive proof that the medium was faking and then he'd reveal himself dramatically and out them as a fraud.<br />
<br />
I can see why you like him.<br />
<br />
You can't tell me you wouldn't love to flip a table and tell off a fake medium.<br />
<br />
Fake medium...implying there are real mediums?<br />
<br />
Well~ who's to say?<br />
<br />
Don't tell me you believe in ghosts.<br />
<br />
Fine, I won't tell you.<br />
<br />
Oh my god.<br />
<br />
You can't prove there aren't ghosts!!<br />
<br />
The burden of proof is yours, man. I can't prove a negative.<br />
<br />
Have you ever seen a ghost?<br />
<br />
...no<br />
<br />
-\_(tsu)_/-<br />
<br />
Not yet!<br />
<br />
Do you really believe in that stuff?<br />
<br />
I'm just open to the possibility. There are a lot of crazy things in the world. You should know that better than anyone, Mr. Science Man.<br />
<br />
Nothing exists in the world that can't be explained with science.<br />
<br />
Maybe ghosts and things like that are just a science we haven't figured out yet.<br />
<br />
Doubtful.<br />
<br />
Psychology is a legitimate science, right?<br />
<br />
A SOFT science, but yes.<br />
<br />
But we barely know how the human brain works right now, yet there's no denying there are extensive mental machinations governing everything we do. Just because we don't understand it, that doesn't mean it's not there.<br />
<br />
That's different.<br />
<br />
For now~<br />
<br />
Psychology moves slowly because it's the mind trying to understand itself, but most of it is ultimately testable. Theories involving ghosts or the afterlife, by their very definition, can never be tested.<br />
<br />
So I guess we'll never know for sure!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;As someone who knows so much about human psychology, I would think you'd be quick to attribute supernatural phenomenon to faulty human perception and memory. Isn't that more logical?<br />
<br />
Sure, most of it is, but who am I to dismiss thousands of years of witness testimony? What are the odds they're all wrong or lying?<br />
<br />
High.<br />
<br />
But can you say 100%?<br />
<br />
You know what, yeah. 100%<br />
<br />
Bet.<br />
<br />
Bet?<br />
<br />
If I die, I'll come back and give you some sort of proof.<br />
<br />
IF you die??<br />
<br />
So if you stop hearing from me and then your house gets possessed, that's me~<br />
<br />
You have no way of knowing where I live.<br />
<br />
I assume I'll attain some sort of cosmic knowledge when my soul merges with the universe or whatever. I'll find you ;)<br />
<br />
How's that for burden of proof?<br />
<br />
I can hardly wait.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Being in the entertainment industry at his age is as much a curse as it is a blessing.<br />
<br />
Gen has the means to live on his own and support himself, he's following his ambitions much earlier than most of his peers, and he's doing what he loves every day. It's hard work, to be sure. He writes all his own material and invents his own tricks, which usually take hours of workshopping and testing just to be feasible, not to mention the additional hours spent mastering every little motion and diversion to ensure his acts go smoothly. But even with the late nights, frustrated practice sessions, and pounds of discarded material, he's proud of how far he's come.<br />
<br />
His extensive knowledge of psychology helps him navigate the adult-dominated worlds of broadcast and publishing, but sometimes it's not enough. When you get down to it, Gen is a kid, something people are eager to remind him of when he gets a little too confident.<br />
<br />
He slams his front door with a loud bang and fists his hands in his hair, clutching tight enough to make his eyes water. &quot;I'm a fucking mindreader,&quot; he hisses to himself. &quot;What were they expecting?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's obvious to him now that the host of the talk show he was invited on didn't put much stock in his abilities, so she was ill-prepared when he started reading her. But what was he supposed to do? He'll pull his punches if he's briefed beforehand, but otherwise he's going to give it his all. It's not his fault she has unresolved issues with her daughter and an unhealthy dependence on caffeine pills. But instead of handling it like a professional, she decided to mock her teenage guest live on air when he couldn't even defend himself.<br />
<br />
Gen hadn't even checked his phone afterward, too furious and dreading the reaction on social media. His book is nearly ready for print and this is the opposite of what he needs right now.<br />
<br />
But he has to check in with his manager, who's probably boiling with rage over the whole thing. So he pries stiff fingers out of his hair and reaches into his messenger bag, stalking into the living room.<br />
<br />
His phone lights up with several texts and a missed call from his manager and he groans, but before he can respond, he catches sight of a notification from Sensei. Right, they'd been texting before Gen went onstage. He should tell Sensei he's signing off for the night.<br />
<br />
<br />
And that's why you actually shouldn't drink tea for a sore throat.<br />
<br />
That's super cool, sensei~! But I have to go for tonight~! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When he doesn't hear back right away, he assumes Sensei has moved on. But then, halfway through an explanatory text to his manager, his phone buzzes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did something happen?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen blinks.<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you mean, sensei?<br />
<br />
You went quiet for a long time and now you're saying you have to go. And you used two tildes in one text. So I was just wondering if something was wrong.<br />
<br />
Aww, are you trying to read me? I thought you didn't like psychology.<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with psychology, I just recognize your mannerisms.<br />
<br />
Are you trying to change the subject?<br />
<br />
Of course not~<br />
<br />
Nothing happened, sensei. But I appreciate the concern <br />
<br />
&nbsp;I don't trust that little gray box, but if you don't want to talk about it, fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen makes a face at his phone. Sensei always thinks he knows everything, but when you get down to it, they're both strangers, and Sensei is younger than him. He has no reason to go blabbing about his problems to a high school kid he's never even met.<br />
<br />
After a tense text exchange and a frustrating phone call with his manager, Gen flops down on his bed, not even bothering to change. The room is dim, only illuminated by the street light spilling in through the window, casting a sickly yellow glow across the walls. Gen cups a hand over his eyes, exhaustion weighing him down.<br />
<br />
But he's still humming, buzzing too much for sleep.<br />
<br />
His phone vibrates beside him.<br />
<br />
He gropes for it, uncovering his eyes and squinting at the glowing screen, wondering what else his manager wants to complain about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do me a favor and look outside.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen rereads the text several times, trying to parse it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Just do it. Are you near a window?<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Humor me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sighing, Gen levers himself up and shuffles over to the window. His bed is in the corner of the room under the windowsill so he doesn't have to get up. He peers through the glass but doesn't see anything spectacular.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, what am I looking for?<br />
<br />
Can you see the sky?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen's unit is pretty high up, and he doesn't live too far into the city, so he can see a good swath of sky over the roofs of the low-lying buildings in his neighborhood.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes?<br />
<br />
What do you see?<br />
<br />
A lot of black. A few stars. Why?<br />
<br />
Do you see a short row of stars with a really bright one at the end?<br />
<br />
Well, really bright is subjective in the city, but yes I can see Sirius from where I am.<br />
<br />
So you know what it's called.<br />
<br />
I do horoscopes sometimes~ I can recognize the zodiac constellations and the major stars. You can't see most of them in the city, but they're up there.<br />
<br />
Of course you do horoscopes. Why am I not surprised.<br />
<br />
Is there a point to this, sensei? It's late and I'm sleepy <br />
<br />
I'm getting there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen snorts and settles into a cross-legged position.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sirius is the brightest star in the sky because it's the closest star to earth relative to its luminosity. It would outshine our sun over 20 times. And it's always been the brightest star, so people have been curious about it since the dawn of mankind.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen stares up at the little star speck in the sea of flat black above him. Even with the light pollution, it's visibly brighter than the other stars in Orion's belt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since you're into astrology, I'm sure you know stories about Sirius.<br />
<br />
Of course. Canis Major. The dog star. The Greeks called it Orion's dog. Ancient Persians associated it with Tishtrya, a rain-maker. Chinese mythology calls it the star of the celestial wolf. Native Americans had references to it in their culture as well.<br />
<br />
Yeah, so it's been important for a while.<br />
<br />
Thousands of years.<br />
<br />
Right. People have been charting its path for a long time. But in 1844, a German astronomer discovered that it had been deviating from its path since 1755. He theorized that an unseen mass was affecting the path Sirius had been on for thousands and thousands of years.<br />
<br />
I see.<br />
<br />
It wasn't until 1862 that researches found Sirius B, a white dwarf in Sirius's shadow. White dwarfs are dying stars with low-to-medium mass. So this massive, ancient star was being affected by the gravity of a tiny, dying star that we didn't even know about.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen props one elbow on the window sill and leans his cheek on his hand, peering up at the little twinkle of Sirius in the distance, considering Sensei's words. It's interesting, but he can't figure out why Sensei is telling him this now.<br />
<br />
<br />
And you're telling me all this because...?<br />
<br />
I just thought it was interesting.<br />
<br />
How things can change. Even our perceptions of things.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blinking, Gen rereads the message several times. Is...is Sensei trying to encourage him? Unbidden, a smile curls the corners of his mouth.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess you're right, sensei~ you never know what's gonna come along and change your path. A tiny, dying star, or a bad day.<br />
<br />
Or a wrong number.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It takes a second for Sensei to respond.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't get sentimental on me. I didn't mean anything by it.<br />
<br />
I know, I know~ that would be way too sweet for someone like you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen glances back up at the sky, still smiling softly, and can't help imagining Sensei, somewhere out there, looking up at the same little glowing dot.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I won't say thank you.<br />
<br />
Good. I'll talk to you later.<br />
<br />
Goodnight, sensei.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Just a hard no? Surely there's room for debate.<br />
<br />
Within our lifetime, A.I. will not reach the point of true autonomy, so, no, consensual sex with a robot isn't possible.<br />
<br />
I'm realizing that I forgot you're a high schooler and I shouldn't be discussing sex with you in any capacity.<br />
<br />
I'm not a child.<br />
<br />
You're literally a child!! By definition!!<br />
<br />
Fine, we don't have to talk about it, but I'm only interested in the scientific morality of the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Sex with robots or sex in general?<br />
<br />
Sex with robots.<br />
<br />
If A.I. can't be fully autonomous, then does it matter that it's not consensual?<br />
<br />
Omg, what's wrong with me?? Don't answer that!! This conversation is cancelled.<br />
<br />
You sure? You seem interested.<br />
<br />
I don't really want to get into morality with you anyway, sensei. I get the feeling you and I won't agree about the entire school of philosophy.<br />
<br />
Why? I think philosophy is important.<br />
<br />
But?<br />
<br />
But it bores me.<br />
<br />
There we go.<br />
<br />
It's all talk and speculation. There's nothing in philosophy that can be tested.<br />
<br />
And I know you hate that.<br />
<br />
The philosophers can sit in their ivory towers and talk themselves hoarse. I'd prefer to be on the ground actually figuring things out.<br />
<br />
Of course you would, sensei~ that's what makes you so charming~<br />
<br />
I can sense your sarcasm.<br />
<br />
Me~? Sarcastic~? Never~!<br />
<br />
Anyway, I never said that people weren't going to have sex with robots regardless, but without complete autonomy, the entire question of consent is moot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you MEAN you've never seen Alien???<br />
<br />
Do you want me to apologize??<br />
<br />
Do you have a rabb.it account? Make one. Now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm waiting for this centrifuge to finish spinning. What's up?<br />
<br />
I'm rearranging my apartment.<br />
<br />
Oh?<br />
<br />
The feng-shui was really off. It was blocking all my chakras and I couldn't stand it.<br />
<br />
Oh.<br />
<br />
JK!! I don't really believe in that stuff.<br />
<br />
Ghosts are a maybe but Chinese spirituality is a definite no?<br />
<br />
For me at least. I'm just waiting for a phone call and needed to do something. I'm regretting it now though. I'm tired and sweaty but everything's in the way so I have to finish :(<br />
<br />
Do you live alone?<br />
<br />
I'm a working professional, sensei~! I pay alllll my own bills~<br />
<br />
How old are you?<br />
<br />
Nosy!!<br />
<br />
Sorry, I just didn't think you were that much older than me.<br />
<br />
I'm not, but I'm not in high school.<br />
<br />
College?<br />
<br />
I went right into the workforce. In a manner of speaking.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I see.<br />
<br />
Are you planning to go to college?<br />
<br />
Yeah. I've already got scholarship offers.<br />
<br />
Seeeeriously?? That's great!! Where do you want to go?<br />
<br />
Nosy.<br />
<br />
Sorry~! I got excited.<br />
<br />
Why didn't you go to college? You're perfectly intelligent.<br />
<br />
Wow, high praise from the boy genius himself  but the truth is I already knew what I wanted to do with my life. I can do my own research and my brand of entertainment requires more hands-on experience than I'd be able to get in a classroom. I didn't see any point in delaying my start for several years just to pay money to learn things I can learn on my own.<br />
<br />
That makes sense. And you've clearly had some success.<br />
<br />
You could say that~ what do you want to make of yourself, sensei?<br />
<br />
I'm going to space.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As soon as possible. I'm really only planning to go to college for networking purposes. Getting on a manned space mission requires knowing the right people.<br />
<br />
Oh, I know alllll about networking~ you'll have to do something about that abrasiveness of yours, sensei.<br />
<br />
What abrasiveness?<br />
<br />
Not everyone likes a know-it-all.<br />
<br />
What about you?<br />
<br />
Well, clearly I don't mind, since I've been texting you for a year now.<br />
<br />
Oh, it has been a year, hasn't it?<br />
<br />
Sorry, I don't remember the exact day :(<br />
<br />
February 3rd.<br />
<br />
Wow.<br />
<br />
I have good numerical recall.<br />
<br />
Clearly. I'm touched you bothered to file our anniversary in your enormous brain.<br />
<br />
Don't be. It's not every day I misread my dad's new number and text a complete stranger about Niels Bohr.<br />
<br />
Well, for what it's worth, I'm grateful.<br />
<br />
For what?<br />
<br />
For Bohr-chan of course! He advanced the study of quantum physics significantly!!<br />
<br />
Right. Thanks, Bohr.<br />
<br />
Thank you, Bohr-chan~!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen catches segments of the shuttle launch broadcast on his phone during breaks from rehearsal. He has a big show coming up, so he can't afford to take a day off, but he's determined to watch because he's positive Sensei will want to talk about it later.<br />
<br />
The commentators talk about a lot of stuff Gen doesn't really understand, but he gets the gist of it, and he manages to catch the take-off livestream. He texts Sensei right afterward.<br />
<br />
<br />
That'll be you someday!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Accompanied by a screenshot from the launch. But then he has to return to rehearsal, so he powers his phone off and slides his gloves on.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, on the train home, Gen checks his phone and is surprised to see no response from Sensei. He shrugs it off. It's not like they're in constant contact, after all. Sensei has his own life.<br />
<br />
So he doesn't think about it that evening, or the next morning when his phone is still quiet. By the end of that day, however, Gen can't help feeling a little concerned. He would have sworn Sensei would be all over the shuttle launch, and he certainly isn't shy about texting Gen when he's excited about random scientific minutiae. So why the radio silence now?<br />
<br />
He decides he'll give it another day. He's pretty busy himself, after all: preparing for his show, writing his next book, fielding interview requests, etc. After his first book took off, his career really accelerated, but he doesn't have time to rest. The entertainment industry is always moving and he can't afford to be left behind.<br />
<br />
So he puts his phone away and opens his laptop to respond to some emails.<br />
<br />
Another day turns into two, into three, four--then a week has gone by with no word from Sensei. Gen tries not to feel hurt. It's not like this is the longest they've gone without speaking to each other, but he'd been so sure Sensei would want to gush about the shuttle, and he'd been looking forward to sharing that excitement with him for reasons he doesn't really want to examine.<br />
<br />
Sensei is a student, Gen rationalizes, sitting on his bed, knees to his chest, staring at his dark phone on the duvet in front of him. He probably just got busy with school. <br />
<br />
The sun is mostly gone, nothing but a thin haze of orange on the horizon, but his room is lit by strands of string lights crisscrossing the walls haphazardly, a decision he made when he rearranged his apartment a while back. He kept the bed by the window, though, and every time he looks outside at night, he finds Sirius in the sky, recalling Sesnsei's dry explanation so many weeks ago. It's comforting in a way he can't explain.<br />
<br />
Now, he glances out the window, at the darkness overtaking the sky, and a thought occurs to him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sensei, can you see the ISS in the sky?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He vaguely recalls hearing something about the ISS looking like a star from earth but he can't remember the details. Could something so comparatively small really be visible from the surface?<br />
<br />
After a whole week of nothing, Gen isn't really expecting a response, so when his phone vibrates a minute later, he jumps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, but not for very long.<br />
<br />
What do you mean?<br />
<br />
Due to the way it's orbiting earth, when it is visible, it looks like it's moving very fast. It moves from horizon to horizon very quickly, so there's not much to look at.<br />
<br />
Seeeriously? Can you see it from Japan?<br />
<br />
Not tonight, and probably not from the city. In the suburbs, maybe<br />
<br />
Not tonight? Did you look it up?<br />
<br />
I know the schedule.<br />

Gen can't quite put his finger on it, but something seems off about Sensei tonight. Usually, he'd be chomping at the bit to explain the ISS's orbit in excruciating detail, but he's being shorter than usual. It's hard to get a read on someone who's not physically in front of him, but Gen's been talking to Sensei long enough that he's pretty sure he can tell when something's up.<br />
<br />
That being said, what can he even do about it? It's not his business, not really. But when he factors in Sensei's week-long absence, he just can't shake the concern.<br />
<br />
Fuck it, he thinks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is something wrong, sensei?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He tosses the phone to the other side of the bed and glares out the window. This is stupid. He shouldn't feel this nervous. Sensei didn't hesitate prying into his personal life that one time, did he? They're friends, in a weird way, and don't friends ask about each other?<br />
<br />
All rationalizations aside, he grits his teeth when his phone buzzes a minute later.<br />
<br />
<br />
No. Sorry I disappeared for a week.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing, predictably. Sensei isn't the type to be open with his feelings, Gen knows that much for sure. But something is obviously bothering him. Should Gen push it or let it go?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah I was really lonely <br />
<br />
I thought you'd want to talk about the shuttle launch. I made sure to<br />
watch it just for you~<br />
<br />
I caught bits of it.<br />
<br />
Pretty cool, huh~?<br />
<br />
Of course.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
God, this is like pulling teeth. Gen pushes his hair behind his ear and tries again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Didn't you say your father was studying to go to space? How is that going?<br />
<br />
Pretty well.<br />
<br />
That's great!! Maybe you two will be able to go together!<br />
<br />
Maybe.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen pouts. If Sensei really doesn't want to talk, he c</td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">Izuku Midoriya was exceptionally unlucky when it came to shopping mall outings. <br />
<br />
Or perhaps - and on second thought much more likely - it was just this particular mall which he should have crossed out from his list of places to visit on a slow day way back at the beginning of their first high school year. But Izuku Midoriya was stubborn, or maybe naive, or perhaps even stupid, depending on whom you ask, and the mall had a lovely milkshake place. (It offered student discounts!)<br />
<br />
The dorm buildings at UA were a welcome development. It was easier to train, easier to study for tests or do homework, when your classmates were all just a corridor and a knock away. Yet sometimes - and Midoriya knew for a fact that he wasn't the only one of this opinion - it all got a little too much. Sometimes you just want to not have people looking over your shoulder every waking hour. <br />
<br />
And the mall was nearby, alright? A few streets away, or one bus stop if you were feeling lazy. It had a lovely milkshake place, and an arcade, and enough shops to pass an afternoon distracted from all the work and expectations and dangers a UA student life. So sometimes Izuku would get his permission from Aizawa-sensei - the man wasn't fussy about it - and then slip out of the school gates with the intention to return in a couple of hours with some new All Might merch or a cool shirt. <br />
<br />
But here's the catch: you can only be distracted from the dangers of a UA student life if said dangers don't follow in your footsteps. And when it came to dangers, Izuku Midoriya was exceptionally unlucky. <br />
<br />
(Or, again: naive, stubborn, stupid; underline as applicable.)<br />
<br />
The first time it happened was on a Saturday afternoon. Izuku was sitting in the milkshake shop, at a wrought iron table decorated by flowers whose petals fluttered whenever a new customer opened the door. He heard the windchime tubes sound off, and a husky drawl order a cherry milkshake, and still, he didn't look up from his notebook, too busy doodling Iida's newest upgrade to his hero suit (courtesy of Hatsume Mei).<br />
<br />
That was, of course, until someone pulled a chair up to his table and collapsed down onto it with a huff. <br />
<br />
&quot;You UA students sure like this place a bunch, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, Izuku looked up by then. By then it was also, of course, too late. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shigaraki,&quot; he exhaled. The man raised one finger up, shaking it precariously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-uh. You remember what I told you last time about causing panic? No one wants that. Don't run, and I might not even need to get all close and personal, Midoriya.&quot;<br />
<br />
He set his milkshake down on the table, pink and fluffy and too light against the black of his hoodie. Izuku closed his notebook and shoved it into his bag. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want,&quot; he managed. Not even a question, just a quiet, trembling whisper. <br />
<br />
Shigaraki smiled wider. His eyes were barely visible, hidden by the hood and the hair locks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don't want much. Just to catch up, you know? It's been so long since we had a friendly chat.&quot;<br />
<br />
They never had a friendly chat. <br />
<br />
&quot;We never had a friendly chat,&quot; Izuku said out loud, his eyes dashing around the room frantically in search of possible escape routes which wouldn't leave civilians in danger. &quot;You held me at gunpoint.&quot; <br />
<br />
Metaphorically, of course, for fingertips could hardly count as a gun. No less scary for it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Detail, detail,&quot; Shigaraki waved him off, slurping his milkshake. &quot;They really know how to make these here, huh? A nice place. Would be a shame if some little hero just bolted out of it, leaving the owner in a scary villain's hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Izuku fixed him with a stare. His face was hot, of anger or of fear he couldn't tell, and he found his fist clenching tightly around his plastic straw. <br />
<br />
&quot;Leave her out of this,&quot; he said, quietly. &quot;You want me here? I'm here. Ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ask,&quot; Shigaraki snorted, pitching his voice a few semitones up in an attempt at mockery. &quot;Well, at least you're being polite this time. Should have known earlier that the best way to get little heroes to cooperate is to threaten civilians around them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did that last time too if you don't recall,&quot; Izuku snapped hoarsely. &quot;What are you playing here, Shigaraki? What do you need?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you asked,&quot; the villain snorted. &quot;Currently trying to pass Watch Dogs Two. A fun title, actually, I'd recommend if you're into action games.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midoriya blinked. He couldn't help it, he just blinked, and then stared at the man for a long, long moment, because a video game suggestion was ridiculously low on the list of things he expected to hear. Shigaraki threw his head back and laughed, quiet but sharp, almost like a crow's cawing. <br />
<br />
&quot;What, not an action guy? Can't say I'm surprised. Bet you're into visual novels and all that shit - for the plot, no less.&quot;<br />
<br />
This time Izuku's blush was almost certainly of embarrassment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Listen,&quot; he said, trying to keep his voice level. &quot;I don't- I don't get it. What do you want from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already told you,&quot; the man shrugged. &quot;A catch-up. Not to say anything about my fellow League members, but god, do they ever get on your nerves. You ever tried to stay in the same building as Toga for longer than twenty-four hours? It's hell on Earth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midoriya blinked again. He figured that asking Shigaraki about his intentions for, what, third, fourth, fifth time would be ridiculous, yet he was still no closer to figuring out the answer. He stirred his milkshake with his straw almost absently, eyes focused on the villain's hood. <br />
<br />
Well, if he wanted to play the talking game, at least Izuku could play along. <br />
<br />
&quot;That so?&quot; he hummed carefully. &quot;I'd imagine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you couldn't even,&quot; Shigaraki grinned, clearly delighted that his rules were accepted (even though Izuku couldn't for the life of him figure out rules to what.) &quot;The little gremlin even pisses Kurogiri off, and I thought it was nigh impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kurogiri is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Warp gate,&quot; the man waved him off dismissively. &quot;Really, keep up, Midoriya. I could probably name your entire class at this point. Your school should really think their traditions through - transmitting Japan's greatest upcoming stars on live television every year is hardly the most logical course of action, no?&quot;<br />
<br />
Izuku found himself nodding in agreement - so much for keeping uptight. He's discussed it with his classmates before, probably around the time of the provisional license exam, and they all came to a unanimous conclusion that as far as secrecy goes, especially with quirks such as Shinsou's, even if the boy wasn't in their class (yet!), UA is decisively crappy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you agree,&quot; Shigaraki smirked. &quot;How're fellow aspiring heroes? Studying hard? Sleeping enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't look like you have the rights to talk about anyone's sleeping habits,&quot; Izuku snapped back, and then bit his tongue because, shit, this wasn't a friend on whom he could practice his comeback skills; it was a villain who could kill him with a swoop of his hand.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the villain seemed to have found it amusing. He took a long swig of his milkshake, half-closing his eyes behind the tangled bangs, and then moved the glass aside. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you were wrong,&quot; he said, too solemnly to be serious. &quot;Can't remember the last time I got an eight hour's sleep. Criminal life waits for no man.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And yet you chose it,&quot; Midoriya muttered, finishing his own drink in one long sip. Somehow, out of all things, that was the wrong one to say, because Shigaraki's eyes went dark as he looked away through the shop window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or did it choose me?&quot; he asked, a weak attempt at the mocking tone he wore up to this point. &quot;These things are a matter of a gacha spin, Midoriya. Some of us win, and some of us lose.&quot;<br />
<br />
He clenched his fingers, slowly, then unclenched them, and suddenly Izuku realised with uncomfortable vividness that he knew just what the man meant. If even people like Shinsou were whispered about behind their backs when it came to quirks, then what would come of a kid who destroys anything he touches? <br />
<br />
Izuku wondered what's worse: that, or lacking a quirk entirely. <br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose so,&quot; he said, too late and too quiet. &quot;But then, people still win at poker with shitty hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When they're very lucky, and very good at bluffing,&quot; Shigaraki shrugged. &quot;I'm neither. You would know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Izuku would know. If nothing else, that much they shared.<br />
<br />
Although - well, perhaps not the former. He could, after all, feel One for All crackling under his skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't, actually,&quot; he said instead. &quot;Never played poker.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got him a laugh, and perhaps it was ridiculous to feel even passingly proud for getting a laugh out of a man who just threatened to murder an innocent civilian, but Midoriya did nonetheless. Shigaraki shook his head and looked at his milkshake in consideration before grabbing the glass with four fingers and finishing it at a swallow. He rummaged through the pockets of his hoodie, then threw some crumpled bills on the table between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, count your drink on me then,&quot; he smirked. &quot;Nice chat. We should do that again sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then he turned around and walked back out, just like that, with the melody of windchimes and the air of unease following him all the way out. Izuku looked through the shop window, eyes transfixed on the hooded figure as it made its way down the escalator and through the crowds, masterfully uninteresting. <br />
<br />
If you didn't know what to look for, you would never know you just brushed your shoulders with a villain. <br />
<br />
Izuku knew though. <br />
<br />
Izuku knew. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
They most certainly shouldn't have done it again. And besides, the second time couldn't even be attributed to misfortune, because if you were frequenting a place where a villain would know to find you if he felt like it, it was most certainly due to stubbornness. (Or naivete, or stupidity - same old song.)<br />
<br />
Or maybe you just really liked their milkshakes. I mean, come on - student discounts were definitely worth an occasional brush with death. <br />
<br />
Or so Izuku tried to tell himself, at least, as he pointedly didn't look up at the man who sat himself across from him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do they teach you future heroes?&quot; Shigaraki marvelled, setting a cherry shake atop their shared table. &quot;You know, when I told Kurogiri about our last rendezvous, he was thoroughly disappointment in my general lack of caution.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought only Toga could do that?&quot; Izuku raised one eyebrow. The man snorted, taking a sip of his drink. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah. She's the only one who can piss him off - but disappointment is practically his constant state of being.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Around you? I wonder why I'm not surprised.&quot;<br />
<br />
They sat in silence for a moment, engaged in a game of stare-down in which neither participants quite knew what was on the line. <br />
<br />
&quot;You've got a sharp tongue, Midoriya. Didn't expect it from you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If I had a hundred yen for every time someone told me that, I wouldn't need student discounts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, in that case I'm glad you don't,&quot; Shigaraki shrugged. &quot;Or god forbid you'd stop showing your little freckled face around here, and what would I do with my Saturday afternoons then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't make this out to be a regular thing, Shigaraki. I hadn't agreed to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't recall you agreeing to sit with me either, and yet here we are,&quot; the man shrugged sarcastically. &quot;Wanted to ask you since last time, for the record - you drink your milkshakes purely for aesthetic, or do you actually think matcha and ice cream are a good combination?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would ask you the same, but pink doesn't even fit your look,&quot; Midoriya argued, rightfully offended. &quot;Cherry is the worst flavour you could have picked, and that's rivalling bubblegum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse you!&quot; Shigaraki narrowed his eyes. &quot;Cherry is superior to everything else they sell here, and you with your matcha-coloured hair don't get to make an argument.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure there's a logical fallacy there somewhere,&quot; Izuku muttered. &quot;Besides, you literally do not have a single right to talk about hair. Have you looked in the mirror lately? Do you even know what a hairbrush is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't reflect in mirrors,&quot; Shigaraki told him, so earnestly that Izuku was thrown off for a moment, hands itching for a pen to write it down. Was it quirk-related? A secondary one perhaps, for it didn't quite seem to relate to Decay in any significant manner? Then again, there were people whose appearances didn't really relate to their quirks at all - take Ashido for instance - so perhaps it actually was just a-<br />
<br />
Shigaraki burst out laughing. <br />
<br />
&quot;You should have seen your face, Midoriya,&quot; he managed through wheezy snorts. &quot;You actually believed me, oh my god.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Izuku mumbled, feeling his cheeks and ears heat up again and taking a swig of his milkshake to cool them. &quot;Okay, in my defence, with your appearance, I really wouldn't be surprised!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Petty,&quot; Shigaraki chuckled, his laughter finally settling. &quot;What else can I make you believe, I wonder? What if I tell you that Dabi glows in the dark? Or that Spinner hibernates? That I am Nana Shimura's grandson?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, to be fair, Asui-san-&quot; Izuku begun, and then snapped his mouth shut, his straw slipping out of his fingers. Jokes or jeers can be very elaborate, sure, but they aren't... they don't get so... specific. &quot;Are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I what?&quot; Shigaraki raised one eyebrow. Izuku exhaled in frustration, picking up his straw again and scraping it against the sides of his glass. <br />
<br />
&quot;The last thing you said,&quot; he frowned. &quot;Shimura-san's... you know!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What of it?&quot; the villain smirked, and the smirk was dark now. It reminded Izuku of their first encounter back in this exact mall, and of thin, cold fingers around his neck. &quot;What if I were, Midoriya? She didn't leave behind a legacy, or an inheritance, or even a wise word. Even if I were, what of it?!&quot;<br />
<br />
He banged his fists against the table, and some customers turned their heads to face them. Izuku tried his best to make himself seem inconspicuous; to make it look like he wasn't trembling. <br />
<br />
Oh, but she did, Midoriya didn't say. He didn't say, although he really wanted to, that her legacy was All Might, and One for All, and in a strange, convoluted manner even Midoriya himself. All of that would be a secret, too big of a secret to tell, that much he knew; but it didn't mean that his tongue didn't itch with un-spilled words. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; he shrugged instead. His voice was flat, too flat to be realistic, but it was either that or pathetic quivers. &quot;I don't know what of it, Shigaraki. It's just a really sad joke on universe's behalf.&quot;<br />
<br />
When the man stormed out of the shop, Midoriya didn't even bother watching him leave. Why do it if you expect him to come back regardless?<br />
<br />
(Still - perhaps he could have done the courtesy of paying for himself.)<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
A funny thing about classmates and other friends your age is small talk. It's so easy, talking about the weather, or complaining about training sessions, or nerding out about the latest hero news or debuts. You ask them whether they slept well, and what they got on their last English test, and if they're planning to go home to their parents for the weekend. <br />
<br />
You don't quite have the luxury of that when it came to milkshake dates with your arch-nemesis. (A ridiculous sentence in itself, by the way - certainly not the one Izuku has ever thought he would need to use in regards to himself, if he ever thought about it at all). It's not like he could just ask Shigaraki about homework exercises, for God's sake!<br />
<br />
Shigaraki, for one, had no qualms about interrogating Midoriya on UA with all its daily routines and heroic proteges, but Izuku wasn't stupid enough to answer. Ditto the other way around - no matter how much he tried to elicit from the other man the details about the League's plans or new recruits, Shigaraki kept his mouth firmly shut. So that, in turn, pretty much left them without daily lives as far as conversation topics went, and talking about weather was just stupid. <br />
<br />
(Oh, and hero news were, of course, far too tied up with the former. It's the civilians who had the privilege of discussing recent villain attacks as an unrelated topic - Shigaraki, on the other hand, was probably behind at least a couple of them.)<br />
<br />
One thing they did have were milkshake flavours. <br />
<br />
Izuku would still testify, for the record, even in the court of law, that cherry milkshakes did not have the right to exist. Shigaraki tried to argue that he would do the same against matcha-flavoured ones, but joke's on him, because he wouldn't even dare show his face around a public institution. <br />
<br />
&quot;One day I'm going to force you to try it,&quot; he said ominously. &quot;And then you are going to have to admit that I'm right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not before you try mine,&quot; Izuku argued, leaning back against the glass of the window. They were both, he has come to realise, exceptionally stubborn, but if anything, somehow it made their chats that much more exciting. (Then again - perhaps all the excitement was the adrenaline of being a table's length away from death.)<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna see who's better at being convincing?&quot; Tomura raised his eyebrows, running his fingers down his glass, careful to keep at least one of them away from the cool surface.<br />
<br />
(Case in point.)<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd rather not,&quot; Midoriya laughed, taking a sip. &quot;Agree to disagree?&quot;<br />
<br />
He was, for the record, aware just how bad of an idea this entire thing was. But then, Izuku Midoriya was known for bad ideas when it came to others. He threw himself at villains with nothing but a schoolbag, broke his bones in a seemingly futile bid to convince someone to give a battle their all, and, apparently, hung out with crime overlords in milkshake bars. <br />
<br />
Okay, that was kind of unfair. Shigaraki wasn't really a crime overlord. He was just... He was just... well. <br />
<br />
That was one of the reasons why Izuku found himself going back, wasn't it? Shigaraki was &quot;just&quot; nothing. He was intriguing, and mysterious, and far too dangerous to make for a good coffee date - but then, these weren't dates and they didn't drink coffee, so Izuku was, perhaps, fine. <br />
<br />
And perhaps feeling bad for a villain who seemingly didn't see much wrong in almost-murdering high school students was the stupidest, stubbornest, most naive thing Izuku has done to date. But then - hell. What did he care?<br />
<br />
&quot;Agree to disagree,&quot; Shigaraki narrowed his eyes lazily. &quot;But keep your inferior opinions about berries to yourself, Midoriya.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't cherries technically fruit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, whichever scientist came up with these ridiculous qualifications-&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, he didn't care at all. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Except.<br />
<br />
Except when.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get out of here,&quot; Aizawa-sensei barked at them. He stepped to the front of the class, eyes red, hair locks tossed upwards by his quirk as much as the wind, but even he must have known that a fight like this he couldn't handle alone. Not in an alleyway, in broad daylight, with panicked civilians and enemies surrounding his students from all sides. <br />
<br />
Except when Izuku was reminded just what made a villain such. And that 1-almost-2-A was not allowed field trips - not now, not ever. <br />
<br />
They had their licenses - all of them, by now. They could fight. <br />
<br />
&quot;No offence, teach, but I don't think that's happening,&quot; Kaminari smirked, his hands crackling with static electricity. &quot;I think they need a reminder as to who's the boss here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you need a reminder,&quot; Jirou muttered. &quot;For all I remember, the last time you had to fight, you ended up frying your brains again, and Momo and I had to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough.&quot; A dry, loud, brusque command in a voice Izuku would give a lot not to find familiar - for so many different reasons. &quot;You want to remind us of something? Let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
But then, in a fight you don't really get to think about your regrets, or wishes, or tentative friendships based on a frankly ridiculous lack of small talk. In a fight you get to think about running, and jumping, and not getting killed; and if somehow you have enough brain space to focus on minimizing injuries, that could almost be seen as impressive. <br />
<br />
In a fight, Izuku Midoriya could almost forget who he was fighting against. <br />
<br />
For a bit. <br />
<br />
For as long as he could slam some small fry villains into walls and not come face to face with-<br />
<br />
Well. Face to hand?<br />
<br />
He thought that he should really ask Shigaraki what his deal with the hands was. And then - that perhaps he shouldn't be planning not-quite-coffee-date conversations while on the brink of death. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let him go,&quot; Aizawa-sensei said hoarsely. Shigaraki raised his eyebrow - not visible behind the hand, of course, but still evident in the slight amused upturn of his voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; he said mockingly. &quot;I can hold onto him for way longer than you can keep from blinking, Eraserhead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Did Izuku mention yet that fingers around his neck was a complete and utter deja vu? <br />
<br />
And here he was thinking they were past this step in their relationship. <br />
<br />
&quot;I will kill you,&quot; Aizawa growled. &quot;You hurt my kid, I will kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How... heroic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perhaps if he had a bit more time to think instead of panicking, Izuku would be flattered. Or perhaps he would have thought of a better thing to say, given the situation, given everyone who could hear them right now. Maybe - hopefully - both. <br />
<br />
But alas. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he said instead of thinking, too loud, too brittle, and he didn't quite watch, but still saw the villains and the heroes alike freeze in places around him. Good - who knew what value did a startled Tomura Shigaraki give to their maybe-friendship. &quot;You gonna kill me? Before I try a cherry milkshake?&quot;<br />
<br />
On second thought, maybe he wouldn't have thought of a better thing to say even if he had the chance, because the outright confusion which reflected on Aizawa-sensei's face was completely worth it. It got even better when Shigaraki laughed, like a raven, and dropped his hand to the side, not before running one finger down the side of Midoriya's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You always know what to say, don't you, Izuku?&quot; he complained. &quot;Well, you promised.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that was that.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&quot;A matcha milkshake?&quot; the shop owner smiled at him, her hair up in a braid and her apron tied with a neat little bow at the front. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was actually thinking cherry, this time,&quot; Izuku grinned back, leaning against the counter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. I've already started making matcha.&quot; She rubbed the back of her neck awkwardly, gesturing back to the milkshake machine. &quot;So used to you having it. But it's no big deal - I'll just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fine,&quot; a voice said behind him, a husky drawl. &quot;I'll have the matcha one. And Izuku over here will just have to owe me a favour for the other day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midoriya didn't even need to turn around to see who was speaking. <br />
<br />
He did, however, need to stop himself from smiling - couldn't let Shigaraki know just how irrationally happy he was to see him after having spent the week worrying he wouldn't - not again. Not after messy battles and even messier reminders that they were still on the different sides of this particular barricade of morality and social norms; not after his classmates and teachers drilling him on how exactly did mentioning a fruit-flavoured cold beverage managed to ward off a villain fully intent on killing him.<br />
<br />
(Fully intent on killing him? As if.)<br />
<br />
It seemed, in any case, he also needed to stop worrying for nothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Matcha for Tomura then,&quot; he chirped, turning around anyways to meet the familiar red eyes under a mop of tangled not-quite-bubblegum-blue hair. &quot;Let's see what cherry is all about, huh?&quot;</td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">Eddie Munson is no stranger to hangovers. <br />
<br />
He's practically perfected them, honestly: the ritual of drinking half his weight in water, popping whatever drugstore painkillers he can find in the cupboard, spending the day sleeping it off and becoming particularly well acquainted with the cool edge of the toilet bowl. It's not a big deal, really, and he's used to it: the mouth that tastes like the floor of a public restroom, the acid burning his throat and making his stomach roil all day, the inability to sleep through the pounding in his head. It's just something you have to muscle your way through, the consequences of a fun (or sometimes not-so-fun, depending on whatever dumb shit he got up to) night. Just a fact of life and of inhabiting a body, like getting hungry and needing sleep and having poorly-timed boners. <br />
<br />
Of late, he's been discovering all sorts of fun new things about having a body, like the fact that it's far more fallible than he thought, actually, that it's something that can be lifted into the air and cracked to pieces like dry pasta, like dead twigs, easier than snapping a pencil in half. That it's something that can have weird, heart-fluttery reactions to being near that annoying guy from school with The Hair who he thought he'd never see again after he graduated. That it's something that can feel unfathomable fear and dread and the all-encompassing getoutgetoutgetout of being somewhere wrong, somewhere where particles of whatever the fuck that is get stuck in his lungs and in his eyes, thick and sticky like he's breathing in poisonous spores, a colony of fungi growing in his chest and stomach until he's eaten from the inside out. That it's something that can feel death itself, blood thick in his throat as he chokes it up, his organs failing, his vision swimming, his ears ringing, the fucking kid clutching onto him and crying as he tries to make him feel better, to tell him to take care of the others. He's dizzy with the feeling, almost like being drunk, the knowledge that he didn't run, the fuzzy adrenaline tingling through his extremities and taking the pain away. The sky is vast and black and the world is so far away, too far away to hold onto, everything dim and unreal and honestly kind of funny in a what'd you get yourself into this time, Eddie? kind of way. <br />
<br />
Then, there's nothing at all. For a long time. <br />
<br />
Nothing until the hangover of his  life, that is. <br />
<br />
Eddie thought he knew everything there is to know about hangovers, he really did. This, though, is something  else,  a whole other beast, something that feels less like a hangover and more like a flu-slash-infection-slash-zombie-awakening. He's confused, at first, thinks he's at home in bed, which he  is,  technically. It's all  wrong,  though, everything quiet and heavy and strange  ,  the air thick as he struggles to breathe it in, everything in the trailer broken and sticky and rotten as he slowly blinks his eyes open enough to look around. For a brief moment he wonders what  the hell  he had to drink the night before until he tries to sit up, the violent twinge in his stomach reminding him of everything all at once: the murders, the Upside Down, the feeling of teeth burrowing into his stomach. When he reaches a hand down to touch his stomach, though, it's smoothed over in freshly pink scars, no more open wounds that he remembers spitting blood all over the ground. He's also not  on the ground,  which means that he got here, somehow, back into his trailer. He realizes that Dustin probably dragged him here, tried to give him the closest thing he could to a final resting place. &quot;That's fucking  heavy.&quot; He says aloud, his voice a feeble scratch, his throat thick and dry like he'd swallowed super glue. Just the act of trying to speak is too much, and he rolls over to spend a good ten minutes vomiting bile into an old Upside Down-ified cereal box. This is the part of a hangover he's more familiar with, though he doesn't have any water or food to settle his aching stomach. <br />
<br />
When he can finally stand he stumbles his way to the bathroom, everything around him sharp and tingly, like he can feel it against his skin, every noise amplified. He can  feel  the Upside Down everywhere, the creeping vines and the dying bats and the feeling of something  torn open,  like he can feel this world bleeding out into the one above, jagged and kind of suffocating. He realizes with a muted kind of anxiety that he feels  connected  to it all, like this world really has started to coat every inch of him in weird inter-dimensional death-mold from the inside out. Only, he's not dead despite remembering the feeling of dying, of knowing  without a doubt that that's what was happening. <br />
<br />
He peers at himself in the dingy mirror. Speaking of zombie-awakenings, that's about how he's looking. His skin is dull and grey, his hair is matted with old blood, his eyes gleam sharp and alien, almost red when he tilts his head back to look at himself. &quot;What the fuck?&quot; He mutters, voice still low and scratchy. Something catches the light when he speaks, a glint from his mouth, and he opens his mouth wider to see elongated incisors, sharp and pointy and  definitely  different than they were before. He laughs, a rough sound that sends him into a coughing fit, and leans closer. &quot;No goddamn  way.&quot;  He says, prodding at them with his tongue and feeling the tell-tale prick, the easy way they almost slice his flesh open. He lifts up his shirt again, looking at his stomach. Still no open wounds. There are bite marks where they  had been, but they're all old, like it's been years since he got them. <br />
<br />
Holy shit,  has it  been years? Has he been in a bat-bite-influenced coma? A frozen twilight state while everything carried on above him?  Did everything carry on above him?<br />
<br />
He puts a hand on the wall for support, trying to get back to the living room without falling over, and he forces himself to be brave, to look up. <br />
<br />
It's still there. The tear between this world and the other one, both of them blending together in a way they hadn't before. It's dark up there, like it's nighttime or like this place took over after he didn't-die and everybody up there is already dead. Only one way to find out. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's been nice, and all,&quot; He breathes, lurching towards the tiny kitchen to grab a chair, &quot;--but I really gotta go. Thanks for the, uh,  fangs,  I guess, and the death and the dying and the horror, that was fun, but I'm gonna scram.&quot; He pushes the chair towards the center of the room and, ignoring the way his stomach and vision both swim with the effort, climbs on top. He gives a final bow, ignoring the way it feels like the Upside Down whispers around him, asking him to  stay, and jumps up to grab onto the edges of the tear and haul himself up into the land of the living. <br />
<br />
He lands on the floor on his back with a  wham  and has to spend the next ten minutes puking into a  normal  cereal box, this time, eyes squeezed tightly shut to avoid seeing whatever's become of his old place, his old stuff, of his uncle. When he finally opens them, digging his blunt nails into his hand to manage it, it seems like it  is  night time, everything still and silent and empty around him. There's still police tape and shit everywhere, but he doesn't care. He's going to have a fucking  shower.  <br />
<br />
The water still works, even shittier than it usually is but still usable, and he scrubs layers of grime and blood off of himself that coat the plastic floor and swirl around his feet. He uses what's left of his old soap out and coats himself in it, scrubbing at his hair and praying that the lack of good shampoo doesn't dry it out too much, the cold water making him shiver violently like all of the warmth in his body has long-since-left. He tip-toes to his room to find clean clothes, wrapping them around himself with reverence and newfound appreciation for clothes that aren't covered in bat juice, and ignores the lump in his throat at the sight of all of his belongings rifled through and broken and forgotten. Even his baby his gone, her usual spot on the wall empty. Did the cops take his guitar? Did his uncle? Does he think he's dead? That's a stupid question. Of course he does. <br />
<br />
He doesn't linger, just grabs a blanket to wrap around himself and a pillow to bring to his mattress. He's too tired to move it but the thought of sleeping under that  gaping maw gets under his skin, makes it itch with the way the grey-scale world seems to whisper for him to come back. He decides to eat something before sleeping, this gnawing sort of hunger buzzing in his bones, so he pulls out some crackers and tries to get them down, the salt wicking away every last bit of moisture from his mouth and making him choke. He almost immediately throws them up in the sink, his body wracked with powerful convulsions like the crackers themselves are poisonous. Okay. Water, then. He turns on the sink and tries to drink from cupped palms, the water a balm for his ashy throat, but his body doesn't seem to like that much either, the water coming back up less than a minute later. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's just a hangover it's just a hangover it's just a hangover it's just a hangover.&quot; He mutters, teeth starting to clack as he begins to shiver again, moving away from the sink. It's getting hard to focus on anything at all, to think of what to do next, and all he wants to do is collapse into darkness and  rest.  The mattress still won't do, still too open and vulnerable and  wrong.  He needs something darker, something more confined, so he goes back to his room, throws the blanket over his desk and crawls underneath it, curling up into a ball on the old carpet and, the wall pressed firmly against his back, feels slightly less panicked, slightly more  right.  He doesn't ponder it, doesn't ponder  anything, just shuts his eyes again and lets himself drift away. It's just a bad hangover. He just needs to sleep it off. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Steve probably shouldn't be doing this. <br />
<br />
It feels like the right thing to do, though, as misguided as it might seem to ride his bike out to the all-but-abandoned trailer park in the middle of the night, a bat shoved into his backpack just in case. <br />
<br />
It's just... Dustin,  man. He's been so down the past few weeks, prone to long lapses of staring off into space, of trying to make jokes that his heart clearly isn't in, of wandering off to be by himself while the others talk and clean and catch up, all wrapped up in each other. Nancy and Jonathan, Joyce and Hopper, Eleven and Mike. Lucas and Max, too, over at the hospital, though Max hasn't woken up yet. Now Robin and Vickie, too, over at the high school. Dustin seems lonely. Will, too, but he's always kept to himself. <br />
<br />
So, Steve thought it might be nice to...do something for Dustin. Bring him something to remember Eddie by. He'd mentioned it the other day, seeming choked up: that it's bullshit that Eddie doesn't get a funeral, that Eddie doesn't get to be remembered for what he was, a hero, that Eddie's uncle isn't even allowed to live at his trailer, just to pop in to grab a few things and leave again. Eddie's death is hitting Dustin the hardest, sitting heavily on his shoulders, and Steve can see him whisper to himself sometimes, like he's imagining what Eddie might say. Something theatrical and sarcastic and bizarre, no doubt. <br />
<br />
He knows there's a chance that his uncle has already taken it, that most likely he  did take it, since Eddie's guitar was his greatest possession, but he wants to look for it anyway, fueled by picturing the look on Dustin's face when he brings it to him--that excited, puppyish smile, an attempt at strumming a few artless chords with his fingers. Just something to hold onto, something to help him mourn.<br />
<br />
It's creepier out here than ever, a ghostly breeze stirring the dying grass, the weathervanes still stuck onto caved-in roofs. The forest stretches beyond, so dark these days that it might as well be the upside-down.<br />
<br />
He swallows and makes his way to Eddie's trailer, finding the front door unlocked and creeping in. It'll be easy. Just pop in, grab the guitar or some other memento if the guitar's gone, and pop out. He won't even have to look up, to stare into the abyss that drips down into the trailer, into the air itself. Nope. He can feel it above him, can feel the chill that seeps underneath his clothes, and he shuts his eyes until he's away from it, until he's at Eddie's room. It's empty, from the looks of it, old posters and beer bottles and records and clothes strewn everywhere, evidence that Eddie had once  existed, had lived and breathed and listened to records and played D&amp;D and read stacks of novels despite failing in school. Steve glances around but sees no guitar anywhere, not in any of the obvious spots where one might be. He'll have to take something else, then. <br />
<br />
He steps over a pile of books to get to his desk, looking for anything that might make a good memento. There's a blanket draped over the top, covering it, so he frowns and tugs it down, scanning the desk. Nothing much to go off of, just more nerdy shit that he figures Dustin  might like but doesn't know enough about to really judge. He's about to grab a clay wizard when suddenly there's a vice grip around his ankle, one that makes him jump and let out a high pitched scream, flailing backwards and thrashing to try and get it off. Nails are digging into his skin, the grip impossibly strong, and he falls backwards onto his ass, landing on a pile of records with a crunch that he thinks is his back, at first. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell, dude?&quot; A voice says, rough and tired. &quot;You couldn't have fallen a foot to the left? You crushed my records!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't land on my Zeppelin, did you? Can you check?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT IS HAPPENING?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop yelling, dude, I'm hungover!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're dead!&quot; Steve blinks, rubs at his eyes, blinks again. That's it, he's officially lost it. He's seeing things. Maybe Vecna's back, or something, making him hallucinate, because why else would he be seeing a very much alive Eddie Munson right now? A very much alive Eddie Munsom who's staring at him from where he's hunched under his desk, his hair everywhere and his eyes strangely liquid, yelling at him for breaking his records, of all things. <br />
<br />
&quot;Evidently not.&quot; Eddie says, gesturing a lazy hand over himself and trying a sharp-toothed smile but mostly just looking exhausted and scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um.&quot; Steve slowly stands. &quot;Are you...is this real?&quot; <br />
<br />
Eddie sighs. &quot;I've been asking myself that since I woke up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You. You woke up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. In... there.&quot;  He jerks his head to the ceiling. &quot;On my mattress. Then I came here. Then I slept some more.&quot; His eyes are heavy and wavering. &quot;I'm  exhausted,  actually, I could fall asleep again right now even though I objectively know that you being here is, like, a  thing  that I should probably do something about.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But...your wounds. Dustin said you bled out, that you died.&quot; <br />
<br />
Eddie pats his stomach, strangely unbothered by what Steve assumes would hurt like hell based off of his own still-healing bite marks. &quot;Yeah, um. That did happen. Then it...un-happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie lifts up his shirt, enough to see pink scars stretching over his stomach where angry purplish-red marks should be. Something about the move feels strangely intimate, the way that he holds his shirt up, watches Steve watch him. Steve clears his throat. &quot;That doesn't make any sense. Mine haven't done that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing makes sense anymore.&quot; Eddie says, clunking his head against the wall and pulling his knees up. &quot;You should be used to it by now, you've had  years to get used to weird shit happening. I've only had...&quot; He trails off. &quot;How long has it been?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A few weeks.&quot; Steve says. &quot;You...you don't know anything that happened, do you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope!&quot; Eddie tries to sound chipper, like it's funny, but he glances anxiously past Steve, at the window, like the very thought of going outside terrifies him beyond all reason. <br />
<br />
&quot;....Okay.&quot; Steve slowly lowers himself to the ground, avoiding the broken records. &quot;How about I go then you go, yeah? Everything we remember from the last few weeks.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a plan, Harrington.&quot; Eddie says, talking through a yawn. &quot;But I might fall asleep again if we don't hurry it up.&quot; As he yawns Steve notices something...different, something stretching out over his teeth. Or  two somethings. <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you always had those?&quot; He asks weakly, pointing to his own teeth. <br />
<br />
Eddie just smiles, his sharp canines gleaming. &quot;Had what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Those...those...&quot; He doesn't want to say the 'F' word. He really, really doesn't. &quot;Those teeth.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We can't  all afford braces, Harrington.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, man.&quot; <br />
<br />
Eddie's face drops, suddenly slightly more vulnerable. &quot;No. They're....they're new. I'll tell you all about it, but you have to talk first. It's only fair.&quot; <br />
<br />
Internally, Steve's brain is mostly just Well that can't be good but externally he just nods, crossing his legs and taking a breath to begin speaking like any of this makes any sense at all. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thirty minutes later and they're both caught up, the watch on Steve's hand telling him it's four AM and Eddie barely able to prop himself up against the wall. &quot;So, Max is just...in a coma?&quot; Eddie asks, voice muffled where his face is mashed into his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Not like yours, though. She didn't get bitten by anything, she got...&quot; Steve doesn't finish. <br />
<br />
&quot;Vecna.&quot; Eddie whispers. &quot;Who's still out there somewhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve winces. &quot;Yeah, pretty much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can feel him, I think.&quot; Eddie says, refusing to meet his eyes. &quot;I can feel  all of it. The ash, the storms, the trees, the vines. Like it's breathing, like it's alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Steve says, scrubbing at his hair. &quot;That's how it is for Eleven and Will, too. Once you're marked...you're marked.&quot; <br />
<br />
Eddie perks up. &quot;So they know what I'm going through?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...no. Nobody's ever...died there and come back, before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie sighs, knocking his head harshly into the wall. &quot;So what you're saying is that I'm a zombie?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not a zombie, more like a vam--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't say it.&quot; Eddie says, shutting his eyes with a hysterical laugh. &quot;I really can't bear it right now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We have to consider it.&quot; Steve says. &quot;I mean...they  were bats.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but  you  didn't get weird teeth or skin or senses or an inability to eat regular food and they bit  you, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They didn't kill me, though. You can't eat?&quot; <br />
<br />
Eddie shrugs. &quot;I just throw everything up, even water. But I'm  starving.&quot; <br />
<br />
Steve tries to stay calm despite the part of his brain that can't decide if he should take Eddie to the overloaded hospital or keep him very far away from any other humans, just in case. He seems mostly normal, behind his appearance, but there's something in the way he watches Steve from the darkness, barely blinking, that feels almost  predatory, different from the way he'd looked at him before. Not that he'd been paying attention before. &quot;Okay, and the weird senses? Is that just from feeling the Upside Down?&quot; He's trying to be systematic about this, to gather the data to go off of the way that Nancy might. Calm, rational, not freaking out or jumping to reckless conclusions. He's not very good at it. <br />
<br />
Eddie swallows, eyes dropping to Steve's neck. &quot;I can hear your pulse. I can hear the grass moving outside. My skin is all sensitive, like everything makes it prickle. I can...I can  smell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calvin Klein.  Obsession. It's new.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not your fancy cologne, asshole, your...your skin.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My  skin?&quot; <br />
<br />
Eddie looks slightly embarrassed, which is a look Steve is not used to seeing on him at all. It's all wrong, like someone's replaced him with a slightly different version. &quot;Yeah. And your...&quot; He sighs, rolling his neck in an agitated motion like he can't believe he's saying it. &quot;And your blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit.&quot; Steve breathes. He leans forwards. &quot;Do you... vant to drink my blood?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck off.&quot; Eddie throws a book at him, which he narrowly dodges. His dark eyes narrow, almost red. &quot;Or else I  will.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Steve scoots back on instinct, the way someone might react to a predator in the wild, and Eddie throws his head back in a laugh. &quot;Hah! You're scared!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not  scared.&quot; Steve huffs, standing up and brushing off his jeans. &quot;Come on, we can't leave you here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wh--where else would I go?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Somewhere where you aren't a room away from an open doorway to the place that's making you like this, for starters. Not that outside is much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know if I should be around people, Steve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pshh, don't be so dramatic.&quot; Steve says, waving a dismissive hand like he isn't also worried about bringing this version of Eddie around other people. He marches over to where he's under the desk, grabbing his hands to pull him up. His skin is cold, far colder than he's felt on another person, even  after the effects of the Upside Down, but he doesn't say that, just leans back to yank him to his feet. &quot;Come on, big guy, out of your coffin.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ha ha.&quot; Eddie says humorlessly, letting himself be pulled up but doing nothing to help. Steve gives a final yank back and Eddie ends up tumbling into him, caught in Steve's arms where he's trying to hold him up, face mashed into his neck. His breathing is suddenly fast and shallow, and Steve can feel it puffing against his neck, making his own pulse rise in panic. Eddie isn't letting go, hands curled into fists in his shirt, and he makes a pained sound low in his throat, mouth smearing against his neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Eddie? You're slobbering on me, dude.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can't...&quot; He says, still not letting go. He sounds dazed. <br />
<br />
Steve gets both of his hands on his shoulders and pushes him back, watching Eddie stumble backwards. When Eddie looks at him, his eyes are shining red and his lips are pulled back, his fangs (let's face it, they're fangs) bared. <br />
<br />
Steve jumps back, hands held up. &quot;Dude!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie covers his mouth, shutting his eyes and shaking his head around like a dog trying to shake off water. When he opens them he's almost normal, again. &quot;Oh my god, man, I was totally about to--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were going to bite me, weren't you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A little bit, yeah.&quot; Eddie says, his earlier joking gone as he stares down at his hands like he doesn't recognize them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, yeah, so, we're going to have to call this what it is.&quot; Steve says, trying to push past the waver in his voice. &quot;This isn't a hangover, Eddie. You're a vampire.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;...Yeah.&quot; Eddie croaks, taking a frightened step backwards. &quot;It's starting to look that way.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Once they're on the same page about the vampire thing, it's actually easier to deal with. Steve can't be afraid of Eddie, not really, but Eddie still doesn't want to be anywhere near him or other people, so they try to work out a compromise. Steve suggests that Eddie stays at Steve's house in one of the guest rooms (&quot;One of? How many do you need, Harrington?&quot;) but Eddie refuses, alluding to a fear of being in a rich suburban neighborhood that doesn't seem entirely related to his fear of attacking anyone. <br />
<br />
Eddie suggests staying put despite the way that he keeps glancing up above him like he's terrified by the way that he can sense the Upside Down hanging above them, which Steve immediately vetoes. They decide to meet somewhere in the middle: Eddie can stay in one of the abandoned trailers at the edge of the park, the furthest away from the rift cracking through the highway and from the treeline. That way he's not too close to roads and other people but also not to the Upside Down or the woods. <br />
<br />
&quot;This was old Betsy's trailer.&quot; Eddie says over his shoulder, forcing the door open. &quot;She was always nice to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That crazy bible lady? She was nice to  you?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Eddie shrugs. &quot;I helped her weed her garden and let her talk about her grandkids. She only tried to get me to pray the gay away, like, twice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve freezes where he's standing, eyebrows raised, as he tries to decide what to do with his face. <br />
<br />
Eddie blows his hair out of his face. &quot;What, you can handle that I'm an undead creature of the night but  that's too unchristian for you?&quot; He says it casually, like it's a joke, but he seems slightly nervous, again, watching Steve like he's afraid he's going to insult him or worse. <br />
<br />
&quot;N-no, man, it's completely fine with me! Both things! Well, maybe not  both things, obviously the vampire thing is something we need to try to fix, but the other thing. The gay thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you can say the word.&quot; Eddie says. &quot;Robin's a good influence.&quot; <br />
<br />
Steve blinks at him. &quot;Robin? How do you...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Call it a sixth sense.&quot; Eddie says, finally getting the door open and tumbling into the trailer. He drops his bag of clothes on the floor and turns in a slow circle, taking in all of the crosses stuck to the walls. &quot;I guess I probably shouldn't be near shitloads of crucifixes, huh? D'you think that one's true?&quot; <br />
<br />
Steve is still having trouble forming full sentences. &quot;There's no way that one's true.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie picks up a crucifix thoughtfully, but it doesn't burn his skin or seem to bother him much beyond making him wrinkle his nose in distaste, which Steve thinks probably has more to do with a dislike of organized religion than any actual crucifix-inflicted discomfort. He tosses it over his shoulder, ignoring it crashing against the wall and leaving a dent. &quot;Well, this'll do nicely! Say what you will about old Betsy, but she keeps a clean home.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;...Right.&quot; Steve says. &quot;So you're just going to hide out here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And sleep some more.&quot; Eddie confirms, yawning again. &quot;I'm ready to fall over.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;...Okay, then.&quot; Steve's suddenly not entirely sure what to do. &quot;And you're okay here for the rest of the night?&quot; <br />
<br />
Eddie gives him a look. &quot;Yeah. I should probably find a bed to hide under in case the sunlight burns me to a itty bitty pile of ash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going to sleep  on the bed?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;...Nah. Not confined enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve lingers by the door. &quot;Okay, well, I can come see you tomorrow and we can figure something out, okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, Harrington.&quot; Eddie's wavering where he stands, looking exhausted. &quot;Sorry about the, uh, trying to bite you thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just don't do it again.&quot; Steve says, trying not to notice the way that Eddie's gaze falls onto his neck and stays there. <br />
<br />
&quot;No promises.&quot; Eddie says, flashing his fangs again and making Steve jump, which makes him cackle. &quot;Too easy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Steve doesn't get much sleep that night. He feels like he needs to tell the others, knows that keeping secrets  never  ends well for any of them,  especially secrets like &quot;Hey, you know the friend you've been mourning for the past few weeks? Well, he's alive but also not.&quot;<br />
<br />
He could also use their help navigating this, because he's not entirely sure if he  should be around Eddie at all considering the biting attempt and he also has no idea where to go from here if Eddie actually can't eat human food, if he's actually allergic to sunlight now, if he's going to turn into a bat and rampage what's left of the entire town, etcetera. It's a lot of question marks and not a whole lot of answers, especially when it comes to what to do next. <br />
<br />
He knows he isn't going to tell them, though. Not yet. Not until they can figure out more, do some Nancy-esque scientific testing to get some concrete information. The last thing everybody else needs on their plates right now is...whatever the hell  this is. <br />
<br />
The next day he waits until sunset to sneak away from the Hawkins relief efforts. He brings Eddie some water and some food in a plastic bag even though he said he can't eat, hoping that maybe that's just a temporary symptom. He creeps past the trailers that are still inhabited, sprinting back to old Betsy's. It's dark inside, all of the curtains drawn just in case, and he finds Eddie in the living room curled up in a fold-out couch that he's left folded up around him like a taco. It looks unbelievably claustrophobic, but he's sleeping soundly like it's actually comfortable, his head poking out. He looks intact in the weak sunlight coming in through the thin curtains, which is good, but he also looks like he's been sleeping since Steve left, which might  not be good. Steve slowly approaches him, and, deciding that abruptly waking someone up who tried to bite him isn't a good idea, decides to throw things at him from across the room instead. <br />
<br />
It eventually works when Steve tosses a particularly heavy crucifix and, as if he magic, Eddie's hand launches out and catches it before it can hit him. His eyes aren't even open yet. &quot;What the--&quot; He says, blinking them open and taking in the scene. &quot;You threw this at my face?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I was trying to wake you up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are  so lucky  I'm more focused on the badass reflexes that I just displayed, Harrington, because I'd throw this back at you if I didn't suddenly have a dexterity score of twenty.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I have literally no idea what that means.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you don't.&quot; Eddie does some complicated maneuvering to get out of his couch-prison, sitting up. His hair is messy, his eyes softer than they were the night before. &quot;Thanks for coming back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I came back.&quot; Steve scoffs. He throws the bag of food at him. &quot;Here, I brought you some food to try just in case.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie looks nauseous just at the mention of trying to eat again, but pours the bag onto his lap anyway. He pulls out the package.  &quot;Raw meat?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah! That's how you'll know if you crave blood!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie states forlornly at the packaged steak for a long moment. &quot;I'm a vegetarian.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Really?&quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, really! Geezer Butler doesn't eat meat, man, it's metal!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie shakes his head at him, disappointed. &quot;Black Sabbath.&quot; <br />
<br />
Steve keeps his distance but moves to sit down. &quot;Well, you have to at least try it, Eddie, otherwise we're not going to be able to know what to do next. Didn't seem very vegetarian when you tried to gnaw off my neck yesterday, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie glares at him, but slowly rips open the package regardless, sniffing at the package like he's afraid it's poisoned. He lifts the raw steak to his mouth, pulling the  tiniest piece off with his teeth before chewing it slowly. &quot;That's--not terrible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not terrible?&quot; Steve is thrilled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not terrible.&quot; He confirms. &quot;Not great, either, though. Especially when you know what happened to the poor cow who gave its life just for us to--&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve doesn't let him finish. &quot;But you not immediately spewing chunks is a good sign, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie sighs. &quot;Yeah, it's a good sign.&quot; <br />
<br />
Over the course of the evening he gets through the rest of the meat and water and keeps it down, though it only seems to give him a little bit of energy, and he's still blinking slowly at Steve and stifling yawns every few minutes as they try to think of a gameplan. They're in agreement that they can't tell anyone else, at least not yet, and Eddie seems reluctantly on board with trying to do small tests so that they can better figure out his newfound...condition. First up is a pain test, which Eddie insists upon. &quot;Alright, watch this.&quot; He says, holding up a large, heavy book. &quot;I'm going to drop this on my hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so.&quot; Steve says, arms crossed. <br />
<br />
Eddie looks confident, holding the book up high with one arm and dropping it onto the other without any hesitation. He instantly yanks his hand away, shaking it out. &quot;FUCK!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still hurts, huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.&quot; He mutters. He holds his hand up. &quot;No bruise, see? That's gotta count for something. We need something sharp.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve doesn't like where this is going, but rummages around until he finds a pair of scissors, tossing them over. &quot;Please don't cut your finger off.&quot; <br />
<br />
This time Eddie seems slightly hesitant, but opens the scissors and uses one side to slice into his palm anyway, hissing through his teeth at the pain before holding up his hand, which is bleeding. Before Steve's eyes he watches the thin stream of blood dry up, the cut slowly knitting itself back together over the course of the next few minutes. &quot;Okay, that's nuts.&quot; He breathes. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fucking  invincible.&quot; Eddie yells up at the cieling, punching the air. &quot;Built in invulnerability spell, you goddamn tentacle bats! Try and get me now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve hides a smile behind his hand. &quot;Wow, you're warming up to the vampire thing quickly, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's called finding a  silver lining.&quot; Eddie digs around in his pocket until he pulls out a lighter. &quot;One more injury test.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don't know about fire, man, every other creature from the upside down really  hates fi--&quot; <br />
<br />
But it's too late, Eddie is holding the lighter under his tongue, grinning at him like a madman as he flicks it on. <br />
<br />
He can't speak for the next thirty minutes, tongue stuck to the side of a bag of frozen peas to soothe the burn, which clearly isn't super-healing the way that the other injuries did. Even though he can</td>

<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Clark asked. He walked towards Barry and Hal who were standing in front of a very closed door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, our security codes aren't working,&quot; Hal explained, typing in his code again only for the screen to flash &quot;ACCESS DENIED&quot;. Clark frowned, trying his own code only to receive the same message.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something must be wrong with the computer,&quot; he said with uncertainty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, could you just like, super strength the door open? I have monitor duty so I kinda need to get in there,&quot; Barry said, shifting from foot to foot. This used to not be a problem. A couple years ago Batman installed anti-speedster precautions into the tower. Trying to phase through the doors now would just result in him getting shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; Clark faced the door and slowly started prying it open. Thank god Bruce hadn't installed anti-super precautions yet, but, knowing him, it wouldn't be long.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're on monitor duty then why is Green Lantern here?&quot; Clark asked as the trio stood in the now open doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause monitor duty is boring&quot; Barry complained. &quot;Not all of us like watching nothing happen for four hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm here to keep him company,&quot; Hal said. &quot;And because he promised me food if I joined him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of us are trying to work in here,&quot; A voice called. The three heroes jumped turning to see a pair of legs sticking out from under the main computer. Barry sped over, pulling the man, the kid really, out from under the computer. He was small but looked to be in his mid to late teens. Over his eyes was a black domino mask that did not feel like an appropriate match to the sweatshirt and pajama pants he was wearing. The kid glared at them and reached for the coffee that was on the floor next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you? How did you get in here?&quot; The boy scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, like it was hard?&quot; The heroes shared a confused glance<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but what are you doing here?&quot; Hal asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fixing your pitiful security system.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Flash, will you go get Batman?&quot; Clark requested. Hopefully the 'world's greatest detective' would be able to figure out where this kid came from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you got it Supes,&quot; Barry said slowly before zipping out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know calling him using the comms would be just as effective. You guys really don't like using technology, huh?&quot; Hal and Clark didn't know what to say as they watched as the boy pulled an energy drink out of his bag and pour half of it into his coffee.<br />
<br />
&quot;We use technology,&quot; Clark defended weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And our security is not 'pitiful'! It was updated pretty recently actually,&quot; Hal added on.<br />
<br />
&quot;When, 1970?&quot;<br />
<br />
Clark and Hal just stared. Faintly they could hear Flash talking to Batman as they walked down the hall. &quot;He just popped out of nowhere and started insulting our security system. Please tell me you know who he is.&quot; As they appeared in the doorway Batman paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Red Robin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey B&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Batman crossed the room and crouched in front of the boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fixing the security system. You were right about it needing updates. It was ridiculously easy to get in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Names, B.&quot; Bruce sighed, rubbing a hand over his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;They already know, Tim. You know they already know.&quot; Red Robin, Tim, as the other three heroes had just learned, just stared at Batman. The whole interaction seemed strangely. . . domestic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, professionalism then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim,&quot; Bruce said again. &quot;Why are you fixing security?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were just complaining about it last night,&quot; Tim said, looking confused as to why Bruce was asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- Tim I just mentioned that in passing. I wasn't even talking to you. I was going to do it myself.&quot; Bruce sounded like-- well, he sounded like a tired dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but you have a bunch of cases right now. I finished all of mine last night so I decided to do this for you. I did all I could from home but I needed the main computer to finish up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're fixing security then why did our codes stop working?&quot; Hal interrupted. Tim looked annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I needed to focus so I cut access to this room. You'll find that your codes still work for everything else.&quot; Was- was that sass? Was this tiny kid that broke into the watchtower sassing heroes?<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you go to bed last night?&quot; Bruce asked, bringing Tim's attention back to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Dick got home after you and tried to send me to bed. So I changed to trick him but then I went back to work cause I wasn't tired and fuck Dick, he can't tell me what to do.&quot; Tim declared righteously, ignoring Bruce's &quot;language&quot;. &quot;Besides, I'm almost done anyway.&quot; He slipped back under the computer. &quot;Also, Bruce you should really stop using our birthdays for your codes. It's way too obvious.&quot; Batman watched, clearly exasperated by the boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Bruce what the hell. Who is this kid?&quot; Barry asked, finally saying what they were all thinking. Bruce sighed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's- this is Tim, he's my son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a son?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How- When?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just one,&quot; came Tim's muffled voice. &quot;I can't believe you don't talk about us, B. Dick will be so offended.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don't mention this to him.&quot; The heroes watched as Tim blindly felt around for his coffee cup before Bruce picked it up. He sniffed it, took a sip, Batglared at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim what's in this?&quot; He asked as his son wigged back into their field of vision, making grabby hands at the cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Life juice.&quot; He said and Bruce gave him a flat look. &quot;Coffee. . . and monster&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How many of these have you had?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have you been awake?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Not more than 78 hours?&quot; Bruce paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you say it like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I mean, I'm not really sure how long, but I haven't started hallucinating yet so I know I haven't hit 78.&quot; Hal, Clark, and Barry shared a look of genuine concern. Why did he know 78 hours was his hallucination limit? How often is he up for that long? How is that allowed to happen?<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim, I told you not to do that anymore. It's not healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No buts.&quot; Bruce stood offering his hand to Tim. &quot;You're finished, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tim said, taking his dad's hand and letting himself get pulled up. He swayed as the too-long legs of his Wonder Woman pj pants pooled around his ankles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are those Jays?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but if he didn't want me wearing them then he should stop leaving his stuff at my safehouses.&quot; Tim said as Bruce picked up his bag and led him towards the exit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that's true,&quot; Bruce said quietly, guiding him out the door. He paused, turning back to the trio before following his son. &quot;I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to anyone else. You can get back to monitor duty now and Clark, please be sure to fix the door.&quot;</td>

<br />
Prompt: &quot;You know s/he's just going to hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me who,&quot; Arthur growled, his fingers pressing gently to the warm bruise marring half of Merlin's face.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tripped coming up the stairs,&quot; Merlin mutters, trying to push Arthur away, &quot;I'm clumsy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Arthur agrees, pulling him back, &quot;you are, but not that clumsy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I really am that clumsy, and if you don't believe me--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't.&quot; Arthur takes Merlin's elbow and pushes him down into a chair, hovering by his side and using one hand to tilt up his jaw. &quot;And I don't think you expect me to either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin's jaw tenses under his hand but there's something else brimming alongside the anger in his eyes. Arthur gentles, cupping the uninjured side of Merlin's face and letting his concern show plainly. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm supposed to be a king one day,&quot; he murmurs, fingers ghosting over the bruise again, &quot;I'm supposed to be able to protect a kingdom and I can't even protect you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't need your protection,&quot; Merlin mutters. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clearly you do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur regrets it as soon as the words come out of his mouth. Merlin's expression closes off and he pulls his face away. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just--is it--what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The note of panic in Arthur's tone must do something. Merlin's shoulders slump and when he speaks he's not angry. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn't matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't tell me it doesn't matter, it does! Tell me what happened, Merlin--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur growls in frustration as Merlin turns his back on him, making to go finish his chores. Something about seeing Merlin hurt yet so willing to just brush it off like it's nothing makes his hackles rise. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin, I'm your prince,&quot; he says through gritted teeth, &quot;if I want you to tell me something, you tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so you're throwing around orders now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't mean--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's too late. Merlin's turned away again. Arthur wants to scream, to roar, to cradle Merlin close in his arms and never let anything touch him away. A horrible feeling swallows his throat that this might've happened before. How many times had Merlin come to him or gone away, nursing wounds no one else knew about? <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; Arthur tries, &quot;tell me. As your friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He thinks he's done wrong again when Merlin's back goes ramrod straight until he looks over his shoulder. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;As your friend might be the problem,&quot; he says, barely audible, &quot;I'm a servant, you're a prince. I should know my place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Know your place, what--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur freezes. Oh, gods, that was why, wasn't it?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur's no fool. He knows he lets Merlin get away with far more than any other master would. Merlin talks back to him in private and in public. He lets him spend days in that blasted tavern with not much other than a scolding and some more unpleasant chores Merlin was going to have to do anyway. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He's risked his life for Merlin. He's committed treason for Merlin. He's risked war for Merlin. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Because this brave little servant with no regard for social customs and an inability to put up with Arthur's shit stumbled his way through all the walls and armor being the Prince of Camelot built him and sat right next to Arthur, determined to be his friend. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need your clothes to be washed today, sire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
No. The title sounds wrong in Merlin's mouth. Normally when Merlin uses any time of formality it's alongside a snide remark that makes Arthur laugh as much as it shouldn't. Hearing it now, the cold detached voice of a servant should reassure him. It should be a welcome change. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Instead, Arthur feels like he's been punched too. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arthur,&quot; he corrects softly. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Arthur,&quot; he repeats, watching a storm of emotions rush across Merlin's face. &quot;If I wanted a normal servant I'd have one. I don't want a normal servant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The uncertain look on Merlin's face turns daggers in Arthur's stomach. He helped put that there. He stands up, crossing slowly to take Merlin's shoulder and set down the laundry basket with his free hand. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't do this,&quot; Merlin mutters as Arthur finishes setting it aside, &quot;don't do this to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur's heart drops. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin,&quot; he murmurs, trying to keep as much fear out of his voice as he can, &quot;look at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin does. All Arthur can do is hold him tightly and try and communicate everything he can't say out loud through eye contact. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not worth it,&quot; Merlin says finally, &quot;you can't go against--them for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So it's a knight or another noble. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;And who was it,&quot; Arthur says, &quot;that marched right up to me and told me every life was worth protecting, servant or otherwise?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He can't deny the glimmer of pride makes his heart soar. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;And credit me with a little subtlety, Merlin,&quot; he continues, &quot;don't you remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At Merlin's faint smile he knows he does. &quot;'S one of the few times I've seen you and Morgana get along.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she hated Lord Jerlon as much as you did. Humiliating him on the training grounds was as much a service to her as it was for you.&quot; Arthur smiles when it makes Merlin giggle. &quot;I think she likes you more than she likes me most days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like that's hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur claps his other shoulder lightly even though he doesn't make an effort to hide his smile. &quot;Clotpole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's my word.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it suits you perfectly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This. This he wants. This he needs. Merlin smiling and keeping up with him word for word. There's no fear in Merlin's eyes now, no uncertainty. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But the smile reaches the bruise and Merlin winces, huffing when Arthur's hand flies to it, checking it over for the third time. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does somebody know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin frowns. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm hurt you won't tell me,&quot; Arthur confesses, &quot;but does somebody know what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Sir Leon saw.&quot; Merlin lets Arthur turn his head to examine the bruise. It's a nasty thing, already turning Merlin's cheekbone purple. If it'd hit anywhere else, it'd have broken Merlin's nose. &quot;Probably a few others did too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
His eyes narrow. &quot;Are you going to ask him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone put their hands on you,&quot; Arthur insists, &quot;someone hurt you. Don't you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Merlin ducks his head and lets Arthur pull him close. &quot;Yeah, I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not that big a deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not like I'll get out of helping him too, he's--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur tightens his grip on Merlin's middle. The fact that he's not looking at Arthur seems to loosen Merlin's tongue.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...he's one of your knights, Arthur. I have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know he's just going to hurt you,&quot; Arthur murmurs, clutching Merlin tighter, &quot;don't put yourself through that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you like me there when you train.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do. I also like you unbruised.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Judging by the way you throw things at me, I hadn't noticed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur pulls back. He's pretty sure Merlin was joking but it's too close to serious for him to leave it hanging. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never,&quot; he mutters, staring at Merlin, &quot;ever do something like that to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin's eyes go wide and he nods. Arthur nods too. The idea of striking Merlin with the intent to hurt, to bruise like that, is horrible. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There's a knock at the door. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enter.&quot; Arthur keeps one hand on Merlin's shoulder as he turns toward the door. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Morgana sweeps in, followed closely by Sir Leon. Her eyes widen and she rushes to their side, her own hand brushing over Merlin's face. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you poor thing,&quot; she says, &quot;I had hoped Leon was exaggerating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never, my lady,&quot; the knight says, locking eyes with Arthur. &quot;Sire, I assume Merlin has told you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur glances at Merlin who's reassuring Morgana he's alright. &quot;Not exactly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Leon looks to Merlin who nods. Morgana turns to face Arthur with a furious expression on her face. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me, Arthur,&quot; she says icily, &quot;is it common practice to strike sparring partners across the face with a staff when they aren't wearing a helmet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Arthur growls, &quot;no it is not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;In that case, I believe Sir Tordwin requires further instruction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Leon confirms the story with a nod. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur glances outside. It's too late in the day to hold a proper training session, they're going to have to wait until tomorrow.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin,&quot; Morgana says, drawing Arthur's attention back to the pair, &quot;I think I'm going to join them tomorrow. Won't you come to help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur doesn't bother to hold back his smile when Merlin agrees. Morgana nods sharply and sweeps out the door again, followed by Sir Leon who ruffles Merlin's hair as he goes. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur stops Merlin from picking up the basket. &quot;You're mine, Merlin,&quot; he murmurs, stroking Merlin's cheek, &quot;in whatever way you choose to be. That means I protect you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin nods, not pulling away from the contact. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;He won't touch you again. None of them will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I'm sure there are better things for me to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Prat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clotpole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dollophead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arthur.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He wouldn't have it any other way. </td>

<br />
&quot;This isn't fucking happening,&quot; Kacchan growls, glaring at Izuku like he's wondering if his Quirk can go as far as burning him with a simple look, knuckles white as he grips his huge red suitcase.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They're both standing in the middle of the two-person room in the east wing of the residential building U.A. has adapted for its new boarding school system. The rooms are three times the size Izuku's one in his mom's apartment, and they all have their respective bathrooms, with a spacious wardrobe. He'd been pretty happy when he'd seen it, before he had a chance to check out who his roommate was.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.&quot; Izuku gulps, shuffling his feet and not meeting the other boy's eyes, swallowing hard, &quot;I mean, we don't have to interact much or anything, it's just for sleeping, really, and that's just -&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut  up  , you fucking nerd,&quot; Kacchan snaps at him. He sets his stuff on the bed near the window. &quot;This is my side of the room, got it? Don't you  breathe  near me, or I'll fuck you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Izuku agrees quickly, grabbing his yellow All Might back pack and biting his lip before saying, hesitant, &quot;I'm just gonna, uh, go, now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He runs out of the room before Kacchan can give him another set of third degree burns, trying not to imagine the likely scenario of the other boy killing him in his sleep to ensure that Izuku doesn't do something annoying, and realizes, dread pooling in the pit of his stomach, that maybe managing to convince his mom to let him come was a bad idea.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ochako is rooming with Yaoyorozu, and they both look not too excited but fine with the arrangement. Iida shares with Yuuga, which, eh, looks challenging, but not life-threateningly, and Todoroki apparently rooms with Tokoyami. Izuku idly wonders if there's going to be too much brood in that room for either of them to function, and almost grins despite his rapidly-rising pulse.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Because not only is he going to be sleeping  meters  away from his ex-childhood best friend, who can conjure up fire in his fingertips and holds a widely known grudge towards him, filled with anger issues and brimming with the need to take Izuku out (is Aizawa actively  trying  to kill him?). Oh no. To make matters worse, Izuku is going to see him  shirtless .<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He's not sure how he's going to survive this.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Kacchan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot; What ?&quot; the other boy snaps at him, pushing up his elbow to glare at him from a better angle from his bed, spiky blond hair falling into his eyes. He blows it away from his face, and puffs of smoke come out. Yikes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, just, um. You're using my part of the wardrobe, too. And,&quot; he takes a deep breath, hoping he won't get punched, letting it all blurt out, &quot;Your stuff is all over the bathroom! And your dirty socks are on the windowseat!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For a second, red eyes settle on his, neutral, and silence reigns in the room. Not a speck of dust moves out of place. A gust of wind hits the window, making him flinch. Izuku's pretty sure Kacchan can hear his ragged breathing from the other side of the room.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And then it all goes to hell.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kacchan lunges at him, leaping from his bed and landing on Izuku's making a low noise in the back of his throat, fists first, grabbing hold of Izuku's shirt collar and throwing him on the bed, placing each leg at either side of his hips, and hisses, &quot;Are you fucking kidding me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, sorry, sorry!&quot; Izuku whimpers, trying to get out of his hold and wishing that All Might's training had covered being immobilized under a much stronger guy who's pissed at him, &quot;I won't do it again, sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regardless, he walks into the dining hall with bruises all over his shoulders and feeling more beaten up than when he'd gone up against the Hero Killer, hobbling until he sits in their usual table, staring sombrely at his plate. He absently notes that Todoroki and Tokoyami seem to be locked in a brooding contest, checking to see who can hold that pouty &quot;I don't want any  friends , I am one with The Night, and my Tragic Past haunts me&quot; look for the maximum time.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Izuku groans and buries his face in his hands, accidentally soaking his sleeve with soup. Great.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;There, there,&quot; Ochako soothes, patting his back softly, &quot;You can always request a transfer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he moans, &quot;Aizawa told us  that the room configurations were final, and if I cause any trouble or complain my mom will know, and that's a bye-bye to Hero School.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rotten luck,&quot; the girl murmurs sympathetically, &quot;Yaoyorozu and I played cards yesterday. Maybe bonding exercises would help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Right when Izuku's opening his mouth to reply, Iida sits down next to him. There is a clean circle cut in his uniform, letting everyone see his abdomen. He glares down at his plate and angrily attacks the soup (which Izuku didn't even know was possible).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't ask,&quot; he says between gritted teeth, &quot;Laser Boy and I are mortal enemies now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ochako and him share a glance that clearly says &quot;Uh-oh, trouble is brewing, we must make Yuuga pay for his evil deeds&quot;. At least, that's what Izuku's pretty sure it means.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; he tries, looking at Iida from the corner of his eye, &quot;At least you didn't get held down on the bed by  your  roommate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he asks, bewildered, when both of his friend send him flabbergasted expressions and Mineta spits out his juice from the other table, &quot;I'm telling the truth!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The next day,  Kacchan turns on the cold water while Izuku is showering, resulting in a screaming match that the whole floor gets involved in, and soap bars starts flying everywhere,  while Mineta throws his purple balls so that people can grab onto them and not slip on the wet floor, earning a &quot;You're not that bad, dude,&quot; from Kirishima, which is a complete lie. Momo makes sure to lecture that thought out from him. Aizawa punishes them all by making them run laps for an hour the next morning.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Two days later, Izuku retaliates by lowering the thermostat until Kacchan can't summon fire to burn his clothes, and Iida appears in the doorway holding a flag and shouting, &quot;JUSTICE FOR CLOTHES! NO MORE DESTRUCTION OF FABRIC! WE MUST FIGHT THIS STRIKE AGAINST THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY, COMRADES!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kacchan rips the thermostat from the wall with his fire cannons and burns the flag, half of Izuku's wardrobe, and his bed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Aizawa doesn't even bother with punishment, just makes All Might frown at them disapprovingly for a few minutes. Izuku's stuck replacing the bed because he &quot;provoked him&quot;, and winds up sleeping in his desk chair for two days while the furniture company brings him a new one.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But eventually, when a week has gone by and  their room resembles a war room more than two high schooler's living space, after Todoroki has been called five times to freeze whatever Kacchan set on fire and Yaoyorozu has had to Create all the stuff Izuku broke with his accidental super strength, long after the Microwave Disaster of Epic Proportions, Izuku sits on the bed, looks at Kacchan, takes a deep breath, and says, &quot;Okay, this isn't working.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Kacchan raises a sarcastic eyebrow (which, yeah, Izuku knows eyebrows aren't sarcastic, but Kacchan's just  are , okay?), &quot;Wow, nerd, you're a fucking genius. I wonder how you realized that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kacchan,&quot; Izuku tries, pleading, &quot;I don't want to be kicked out of school, and I think you don't want to, either. So we've gotta lay down some ground rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
That makes the other boy snort, &quot;Rules? No,  thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot; Please  ,&quot; Izuku insists, looking up to meet angry red eyes, &quot;Just, no messy stuff everywhere, we divide stuff equally, we  don't  put replace toothpaste with glue,&quot; Kacchan smirks smugly and chuckles, &quot;and just try to stay out of each other's way. Maybe we can write down shower times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, right. What's the alternative?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Izuku lets a smile draw across his face, &quot;Bonding exercises, as suggested by Ochako. I have Monopoly and Uno in my bag.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kacchan narrows his eyes and scoffs, &quot;That's not bonding, that's called 'being humiliatingly defeated at board games'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Somehow, that makes him snort, &quot;I'm pretty good at Monopoly, you know.  I figure I could beat you one or three times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, in your fucking  dreams , nerd. Fucking nerds like you have no sense of strategy, you know. Bring it on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Izuku wins three times out of three. Kacchan burns the board and throws the box out of the window. In his anger, he sets Izuku's bed on fire again and manages to take out his duvet before Todoroki freezes it. He's supposed to feel disappointed and irritated, like the roommate situation is going to continue to suck, but something about the other boy sitting there and rolling the dice, scoffing and getting Regular Person Level irritated when he screwed up, makes his heart flutter in a very embarrassing way.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Well, at least he didn't burn the whole bed this time.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you didn't even -!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I  said ,&quot; Kacchan crosses his arms over his chest, &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;But  look  at it!&quot; Izuku pleads, gesturing at the puppy in his arms, melting when it lets out a little yelp and bumps his head against his stomach, &quot;It just wants  love , Kacchan!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's not going to get it here, nerd,&quot; the boy declares, &quot;And anyway, pets are against regulations, and  you 're the goody-two-shoes in this room, so fuck off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor thing,&quot; Izuku coos at him, petting it carefully, &quot;How can you  say  those things, Kacchan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
His roommate finally looks at him, glaring, and opens his mouth to shout more abuse, probably, when his eyes land on the brown labrador puppy, lifting its tiny paw to crawl up Izuku's chest. His eyes narrow, and he glares at Izuku.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh,&quot; Kacchan says finally, wrenching his gaze away, &quot;Go and ask the Eraserdick, then. And if it shits on the bed I'm going to burn it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're so nice, Kacchan!&quot; Izuku beams at him, and runs towards the office. All Might's, of course. No way in hell the Homeroom teacher is going to let him keep it. But a mellow hero with a weakness for strays? He's got a pretty good chance.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The puppy stays.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kacchan names it &quot;Exploding Cat of Doom&quot;.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Izuku just calls him Totoma.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deku!&quot; Kacchan growls, and Izuku groans, burying himself in blankets and turning away from the noise, &quot;Come  on , nerd, we've got class!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too...sleepy...&quot; Izuku mumbles, &quot;G'away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He got to their room late last night, after being stranded in the infirmary for over two hours because of the latest fighting exercise that they had done that afternoon, and all of his body  aches  . His left arm is throbbing in its entirety, and he's pretty sure that he got a nosebleed in the middle of the night. Izuku just wants to  sleep .<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, fuck,&quot; his roommate curses, &quot;If you don't get your lazy ass out of bed Aizawa will just make me come here anyway, so save us both a trip and get up, you nerd.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It  huuuuuurts  ,&quot; Izuku whimpers, clutching the duvet and struggling as Kacchan tries to wrench it away, &quot;Noooooooooo, lemme  sleeeeep .&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're even more annoying when sleep deprived,&quot; Kacchan scowls, &quot;How am I going to deal with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...chocolate,&quot; Izuku mumbles, feeling his eyelids close, &quot;Kacchan could be nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Totoma sneaks his way under the covers, and he cuddles it,  letting out a soft sigh and snuggling into his fur. Everything feels so heavy...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When he wakes up, it's three hours later and no one has shown up banging on his door.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There's a cup of hot chocolate kept steaming by a small flickering flame at the bottom of the cup, and a note right next to it,  Don't be fucking nerd and come to class before Eraserdick busts your ass out of here. Or, you know, don't come, and let me have the room all to myself. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;-The Exploding Fire Badass <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Izuku smiles, almost without meaning to, and puts the note in his drawer, stretching lazily and petting Totoma before getting dressed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Izuku's putting his pants on, biting his lower lip and wincing about how awkward jeans on wet skin are, when the door to the bathroom bursts open.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Izuku says, because he's  in his boxers .<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Kacchan replies, looking suspiciously red and very pointedly Not Looking at anything, &quot;I'll just, er,&quot; he clears his throat and hisses, &quot;Put some clothes on, you fucking nerd! Save your troubling exhibitionist tendencies for that weird floaty chick! Exploding Cat of Doom is young and impressionable!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He slams the door and leaves Izuku standing there, one leg frozen mid-air, feeling like his heart is about to jump out of his chest. Was Kacchan...embarrassed? He feels kind of sick and kind of happy all at once, like he's going to throw up but for a good reason, like eating way too many sushi rolls, and he can't help but wonder what Kacchan thought about him. Does he still look skinny and lanky? He knows that All Might's training and U.A.'s physical programme have helped a lot, but he was never buffy to begin with and -<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Izuku loses his balance and falls on his face on the bathroom floor, groaning. He's going to be late for dinner.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um,&quot; Tooro hesitates, and Izuku wishes he could see her face to guess what she's asking about. She clears her throat, and then blurts out, &quot;Is it true you've got a tattoo on your chest?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot; Kacchan !&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, Deku,&quot; Ochako says uneasily, &quot;Bakugou is glaring at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Izuku looks up from his homework, glancing around until he catches sight of Kacchan, staring at him, and the small silver of worry melts away, &quot;Ah, no, that's just his Nice Glare. That just means he's grateful I did his laundry but doesn't want to admit it. Usually followed by me finding hot chocolate somewhere and Kacchan refusing to acknowledge he brought it from the kitchens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ochako stares at him, &quot; Dude.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, it's right here,&quot; Izuku bites his lip and searches until he finds what he's looking for. Satisfied, he makes a small noise and sets his notebook  Kacchan No.3  on his desk and quickly flips to the end, until he finds the page that's marked by a small drawing of Totoma, &quot;See?  The Many Faces of Kacchan  . I thought it'd be useful to learn how to  interpret his frowns, seeing as we're living together-&quot; (&quot;That sounds so wrong,&quot; Iida whispers,) &quot;- and so I kept chasing him with a camera until i got them all.&quot; He points to No. 12,  The Nice Glare , &quot;Check it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ochako looks him up and down and says, &quot;You need help, Deku.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I keep  telling him,&quot; sighs Kacchan from the desk near him, &quot;Can't believe the kid is such a fucking nerd. Stop stalking me and take your girlfriend out properly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's not my girlfriend!&quot; Izuku hisses, closing the notebook and hoping he isn't blushing as much as he seems to.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have to sound so scandalized,&quot; Ochako mutters, and looks back to her textbook.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Kacchan sneers at him, and burns his pencil with a flick of his fingers.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Exam season creeps on Izuku before he notices, and then it's suddenly time for cramming and studying until his eyeballs fall off. U.A. has a library with tons of places for quiet, relaxing study...except this is a hero school, and the library is usually filled with people shouting and random bursts of Quirks that make concentration more impossible than the off chance that Todoroki smiles at anyone.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So Izuku gathers all of his textbooks, tells Iida and Ochako that they're not to bother him, explains to All Might that he's going to be too busy to continue with personal training these next weeks, makes his mom take care of Totoma for a while, and locks himself in his room.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Locks himself. In his room. With Kacchan.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yeah, great idea.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Somehow, the first day of studying, they don't cross paths, because Kacchan can be kind of arrogant sometimes, without meaning to, and doesn't really take studying that seriously. But on Tuesday, shit goes  down .<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop  muttering !&quot; Kacchan hisses, and throws one of the pillows at his head. Izuku manages to duck in time, but hits himself with the edge of his desk, wincing and rubbing the back of his head, &quot;It's making me go fucking crazy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't help it!&quot; Izuku mumbles, feeling guilty, &quot;I usually study alone, so one was bothered about it before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to go to the Common Room,&quot; Kacchan declares, grabbing his stuff and sulking out of the door, slamming it for dramatic effect. Izuku sighs and emphatically does  not  pout because Kacchan left. He does  not .<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later, Kacchan is back, one of Mineta's balls stuck to his bag, and frost on his clothes. He glowers at him and growls, &quot;Shut up,&quot; before sitting down at his desk again and continuing studying.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The silence is so awkward it's  painful .<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Kacchan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; the other boy asks curtly.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you studying? I'm doing maths.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kacchan bangs his head against his desk, &quot;Can you  please  just concentrate? Not all of us are fucking nerds that get everything immediately, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Right after he says it, the boy freezes, and Izuku stares at him.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-not like I don't, you know!&quot; Kacchan adds quickly, color rising to his cheeks, &quot;I'm much smarter than you, fuck off, okay?! Just shut up so I don't have to tolerate you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Izuku tries, setting down his books and swinging his chair so that he's facing his roommate, &quot;Do you want to study together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Where'd you get that stupid idea, fuckhead?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could use some help with my English homework,&quot; Izuku lies, because anyone can see that Kacchan's struggling and refusing to admit it. &quot;And I'm sure you're a great tutor, oh mighty Kacchan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Almost like it sneaks up on him, the corners of the other boy's lips curl up, and he rolls his eyes and grits out, &quot; Fine . But only because I feel sorry for you, nerd.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; he agrees easily, and grabs hold of the other's desk to pull himself to Kacchan's side, swallowing a bit at how close they are. He glances down at his notebook, and frowns, &quot;You're studying Latin? I didn't know you were in Latin class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I  am ,&quot; Kacchan mutters under his breath, and covers the pages with his hands, cheeks going pink, &quot;I like languages, okay? Even dead ones. Shut up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it's cool,&quot; Izuku blurts out, &quot;And-and you're a language nerd. So, there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Red eyes glare at him, Latin forgotten, &quot;Who you calling nerd,  nerd ?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kacchan's leaning into him, his left elbow propped on the arm of Izuku's chair, and he smells like that ugly black bottle of sports shower gel that he always leaves around in the shower, and somehow that makes Izuku's breath escape his lungs, and he feels terribly, terribly small. His heart's pounding, and he's pretty sure he's blushing. If he looks down, he'll see down the collar of Kacchan's t-shirt.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I'm n-not -&quot; he stutters,  moving his leg up to get a little away from the other boy and  maybe  get some air, but he accidentally pushes Kacchan's chair, and he yelps and loses his balance, falling squarely on top of Izuku and making their desk chair topple to the floor. Izuku hits his shoulder and hisses, looking up and -<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kacchan's laying on his chest, rough and callused fingers holding his sides almost painfully tight, as if he's still falling and clinging to Izuku is the only thing that can keep him stable. His forehead is pressed against Izuku's stomach, warm, and his legs are settled between Izuku's, beltbuckle digging into his pelvis.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;K-Kacchan?&quot; he whispers, almost terrified that he'll brush it off, that he'll shout at him, that this isn't what he's thinking, that -<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And then, suddenly, terrifyingly, exhilaratingly, Kacchan's lips are on his.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They're chapped, and feel a little warmer than his, and they taste (surprisingly) like sugar and sweat mixed together, which shouldn't work but it  does , and Izuku makes a small noise of pleased surprise, hand instinctively going up to bury itself in unruly blond hair. He senses a tongue prodding furiously at his lips, and he opens his mouth instinctively and -<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kacchan's running out of the room.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Izuku's just lying there on the ground, eyes wide, fingertips to his bottom lip, feeling his heart race, and he doesn't know whether to go after him or hide under his duvet or drink fifty bottles of orange juice so he'll die of liquid intake.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deku?&quot; his head snaps towards the door, that's still open from when Kacchan almost blasted the thing off its hinges, but it's just Ochako, looking a bit uneasy, &quot;Why are you on the floor? Anyway, I know you told us not to bother you, but  -&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ochako,&quot; he cuts her off, and he must sound wrecked, because she actually stops short and blinks at him, cocking her head to one side, &quot;Is it possible that I just hallucinated the last few minutes? You room with Yaoyorozu, right? Can she make a machine that erases memories? Oh, man, that would be  really  useful right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ochako bites her lip, thinks for a second, and then declares, &quot;I'm getting Iida.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Izuku ends up blabbering about it for thirty minutes while Iida and Ochako buy him ice cream and pat his back awkwardly, feeling like an idiot for actually starting to cry halfway through and sniffling noisily. The other boy shares a glance with Ochako, and they both unanimously decide that he deserves some pampering.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They buy him another All Might poster for his room, because they're great friends, dammit, and  no , he didn't tear up, Iida, clean your glasses; and get him the latest issue from his favorite manga. The cashier looks very unimpressed at the miserable teenager lounging in his shop.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Eventually, though, Iida makes a tactical retreat, and the only one brave enough to stay is Ochako, who sits next to him and asks, very gently, &quot;Deku, did you want him to do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-I don't know,&quot; Izuku mumbles, wringing his hands togethers and not meeting her eyes, &quot;I mean, it wasn't  unpleasant , or anything. I just, I don't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It sounds lame. Oh god, it sounds so lame.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He's pretty sure he's managing to have an even more emotionally stunted conversation that what must go on in room Todoroki-Tokoyami (oh, idea time: the double T room) every day. For a second, the image of those two boys kissing gets in his head and - no . No, he's not going there.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you liked it, Deku,&quot; Ochako tells him softly, touching his hair fondly. It feels nice, comforting, but nothing like the trail of blazing fire that Kacchan's hands sparked, &quot;I think you're just a bit shocked now, is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does this mean-&quot; he takes a deep breath, &quot;does this mean I'm  gay , now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The girl shrugs, handing him another tissue, &quot;Who cares? Just do whatever you want for now, okay, Deku? You may be a hero, but you're still a teenager.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ochako,&quot; Izuku realizes, dread creeping up on him, &quot;How am I going to sleep there tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
She winks at him, &quot;Well-&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Izuku throws the used tissues at her. She just makes them levitate and throws them back.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kacchan is lazily sitting on his bed when he opens the door  after dinner, highstrung and blushing (but just a little bit!), and he almost jumps when he sees him.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Kacchan growls, closing the textbook he was looking at, cheeks definitely red, and lifts his chin up, almost as if daring him to say something, &quot;It's  you .&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm, yeah,&quot; Izuku admits, caught off guard, &quot;We  are  roommates, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that!&quot; Kacchan snaps, and little puffs of smoke come from the textbook. He glances at it, a little nervous.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I  know  it's great! I don't need a fucking nerd to tell me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just-!&quot; Kacchan makes a frustrated noise in the back of his throat and stands up, waving his arms around, &quot;You make me want to hit things! Lots of things! Many times!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Izuku takes a step back, scratching the back of his neck and hoping that he survives the night, &quot;Um, sorry? I don't...mean to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot; Stop  it!&quot; the other boy shouts, and moves until he's holding Izuku's wrists, hands tightening around them, and he looks wild, like nothing's holding him back this time, like he's going to tear Izuku  apart  and no hero is going to save him, because -<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Kacchan  pulls   , and Izuku stumbles awkwardly into his arms, arms going up to rest on the other's boy's chest, flushing immediately and trying not to meet his eyes, murmuring, &quot;Just, er, let me -&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know why I  like  you,&quot; Kacchan chokes out. Izuku's head snaps up, and he's sure that he looks completely mental, eyes so big they could probably have their own gravitational field, mouth open, hands going immediately still. &quot;I don't know, god help me, you fucking nerd -&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Izuku kisses him, because fuck it, he's fifteen and he's pretty sure he just got a confession, so he's going to go for it. He puts his arms behind Kacchan's neck, a little shy but a little more turned on and kind of excited, and the other boy responds eagerly, hungrily, like he's been waiting for this since the first day they got paired together in this heavenly room, hands going to rest at the small of his back, making Izuku hum contentedly, even drifting lower, which just makes him blush and cut the kiss to bury his head in the crook of Kacchan's neck, feeling his heart race, panting even though they've barely done anything.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like you too,&quot; he confesses, and he doesn't think he's imagining the way his roommate's grip on him tightens.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't let it go to your head, nerd,&quot; Kacchan mumbles, but he doesn't sound as pissed as he usually does, so Izuku smiles and pecks his lips again, feeling almost giddy. &quot;You're still a pain in my ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;That...acquire new meaning, in context,&quot; he smirks, and feels the way Kacchan stiffens and groans.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did this happen to me? I hate the fucking world, I'm going to demand a refund.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're...not, are you?&quot; Izuku asks, biting his lower lip, because he still can't believe it entirely, &quot;I mean...are we boyfriends now? Or are you just...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He pauses in the middle of his mini-breakdown, wrinkling his nose, &quot;Hey, Kacchan, doesn't it smell like -?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Izuku takes one minute to take in his roommate's panicked expression, red eyes wide, and the smoke coming from his hands, and the smell of burnt  wood and -<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my  god , Kacchan!&quot; Izuku gapes, taking a step back, &quot;Did you just set fire to our room?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The bed is  burning  . It's  burning  where Kacchan touched it when they moved a few steps back. Kacchan set fire to the  bed  .  Again . For a moment, they both just kind of stand there, watching the duvet be consumed by small flickering flames that slowly get bigger, with that odd calm that comes with being a teenager and trusting that the adults will take care of everything.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And then -<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to put it out!&quot; Izuku realizes, turning to stare at Kacchan, &quot;Get Todoroki,  right now !&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's at home studying! Fuck, where's that annoying popsicle when you need him?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Izuku breathes, a lump in his throat, &quot;Oh my god, we're going to die because I asked you out. This is awful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just get some fucking water from the toilet!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;How am I going to  carry  it, though?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Use  something , I don't fucking care! Use your fucking head, it's empty enough of a brain as it is!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't  talk  to me like that! That's disrespectful, Kacchan!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to fucking burn to death, and you're worried about  manners ?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm trying to have a healthy relationship!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's been all of ten seconds of this fucking relationship!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAhhh!&quot; Izuku screeches, &quot;I don't want to die like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate you both,&quot; Iida declares from the door, and sprays the tiny fire with a fire extinguisher. Oh, yeah. Because there's a fire extinguisher. Pretty much everywhere near Todoroki and Kacchan. Yeah. That makes sense. &quot;Please go and be useless somewhere else.  Some of us  are trying to study.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kacchan throws a fireball at him, and Izuku starts to scold him, because, &quot;You can't keep hurting people because they disagree with you, Kacchan!&quot; until the other boy just makes a frustrated noise and kisses him.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Izuku whispers as Mineta and Yaoyorozu exchange some yen. She makes sure to wipe her hands clean afterwards.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I was betting on next week, after exams,&quot; the girl says defensively, crossing her arms over her chest, &quot;I thought it was a very useful exercise for practicing reading people and their emotions and -&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I  woooooon  ,&quot; Mineta sing songs, &quot;I  wooooon  the Bakugou-Midoriya pool!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kacchan burns the yen, and, for once, Izuku doesn't shout at him for it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He actually moves a little closer to him on the table, which makes Ochako giggle and Iida sigh, long-suffering.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;WOOOHOOO BAKUGOU, MAKE OUT WITH THE NERD!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Oh. Okay, uh, I didn't think you'd go for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...I'm just going to...go...now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Kacchan,&quot; Izuku starts, a bit uncertain.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; his boyfriend murmurs, hair brushing Izuku's forehead. They're lying on Kacchan's bed, because Izuku's is covered in stuff and he's too lazy and warm to want to clear it all out, so right now he's just using Kacchan as a pillow. Hmmm, he's soft.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;My, uh, my mom wants to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kacchan? Kacchan, is that okay? I just, I mentioned that we're closer now, I didn't  tell her -&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...is that-? Oh my god, Kacchan, are you burning the bed  again  ?! Todoroki!  Todoroki !&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Kakashi is standing in front of the memorial stone in his usual slouch with hands in pockets, large white Hokage robe billowing in the wind where it hangs open, the motion morphing red lettering dripping down the back. He rubs his eye, Sharingan prickling as it activates, spinning to red when its partner tries to find it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need something, Obito?&quot; Kakashi complains.<br />
<br />
ANBU Ox warps out of mid-air, drops the red Hokage hat on Kakashi's head, warps away again in a swirl.<br />
<br />
Kakashi sighs as the eye deactivates and adjusts the thick cloth covering draping from the hat. He turns and blinks when he sees Gai wheel himself down the road towards Kakashi.<br />
<br />
&quot;My Rival!&quot; Gai bellows, still too far out but too enthusiastic to wait for a proper greeting. &quot;You're looking particularly Youthful today!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; Kakashi muses. &quot;Did they really send you to hurry me up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gai laughs loudly, coming to a stop beside Kakashi and striking a pose with his hands now freed. &quot;Your Hip and Cool attitude is appreciated by all, but the-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Kakashi cuts in with an eye roll. &quot;Being late by a whole day doesn't even classify as late anymore, Hokage please stop making the council mad because someone's going to snap and try to kill you and it's making the ANBU twitchy, you're throwing out everyone's schedule.&quot; Kakashi shrugs. &quot;You'd think they'd be used to it by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Gai admits. &quot;But I've been bribed so I'm here anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bribed with what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gai gives him a vigorous double thumbs up. &quot;Youthful Friendship!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I walked into that one,&quot; Kakashi mutters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come!&quot; Gai cries and pats his lap. &quot;I shall escort the Rokudaime Hokage to the gates and see you off on your Youthful journey to our Kumo allies!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maa, I guess I can't say no to that.&quot; Kakashi pulls the Hokage robes tight around him and takes a seat, legs hooking around Gai's, hands gripping the arm rests. He braces himself.<br />
<br />
Naruto steps out of Ichikaru's and turns to look down the road as the faint sound of Youth is carried downwind. &quot;Huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear they made that illegal,&quot; Sakura tsks as she steps up beside him.<br />
<br />
Several civilians are already hustling out of the way as Gai drifts his wheelchair around the corner of the street, a blur of Hokage white and Gai's enthusiastic green racing down the road, a cloud of dust kicking up behind them.<br />
<br />
Gai zig-zags around an old man and the motion is finally enough to throw off Kakashi's Hokage hat. Kakashi flashes through hand signs and the chakra conductive wheelchair transmits it to the ground, earth sliding over itself as everything on the road is shunted to either side.<br />
<br />
Some civilians stagger from the sharp motion and start complaining. Naruto waves and Sakura deadpans a stare as Gai speeds past, Kakashi flashing them a smile with his curved eyes.<br />
<br />
Gai zooms up and across a wall to avoid a cart coming in from a side road, careens back down, does a donut around Kurenai to say hello, and Kakashi makes a ramp just for some airtime where Gai does a double backflip then they both disappear around a corner.<br />
<br />
An ANBU drops down, picks up the abandoned Hokage hat, leaves again.<br />
<br />
Gai stops at the gates with a clean sideways skid and Kakashi slips off his lap, smoothes out the robes and nods at the guards calmly.<br />
<br />
One of the chunin on watch is sitting at the table, her chin in hand. &quot;That thing you did, when you went up on one wheel, that was impressive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, my Youthful Comrade!&quot; Gai responds brightly.<br />
<br />
Kakashi doesn't even complain when Dragonfly drops the Hokage hat back off onto his head. &quot;If I was just a little more corrupt, I would make you my full time guard and force you to take me everywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I spoil you too much as it is, My Rival,&quot; Gai answers but flashes a grin and a glorious sunset appears behind him despite it being ten in the morning. &quot;But know that if you need me, I will always be there for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasuke, having come back from a long trip outside, is standing at the table having his papers checked. Staring judgmentally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maa, Sasuke,&quot; Kakashi drawls, flipping his hat's cloth drape over a shoulder. &quot;Don't be jealous, you know you're my favourite Uchiha.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kakashi does an exaggerated double take towards Ox like he just noticed the ANBU, gasps, fakes a nervous laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate this place,&quot; Sasuke deadpans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you grumpy because Naruto and Sakura aren't here to welcome you back?&quot; Kakashi tsks. &quot;You said you'd be coming tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I lied deliberately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Next time we'll welcome you back with confetti,&quot; Kakashi says, talking over Sasuke. &quot;A parade. Something flashy that's gold - or is gold tacky?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasuke rolls his eyes. &quot;Make it gold, modesty is for the poor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kakashi purses his lips. Smiles anyway. &quot;As always, your humour is about as pleasant as your personality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasuke grunts, takes his papers back from the gate guard and walks past, pointedly slapping Kakashi with his armless sleeve. &quot;Good luck out there, it would be such a pity if Kumo killed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bury my Icha Icha with me,&quot; Kakashi calls out right before Sasuke takes to the rooftops.<br />
<br />
ANBU Koala steps up. &quot;Hokage, preparations have been made to head out whenever you're ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's very passive-aggressive of you,&quot; Kakashi mutters, checks the time with the clock resting on the chunin guard's table. He's already three hours late. &quot;Bye, Gai. Tell Naruto that Sasuke was sad he didn't get a proper welcome back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kakashi usually has six ANBU on him at all times, the captain being ANBU Ox because quite frankly no on else wants Obito and Kakashi had to bullshit something about keeping a 'close eye' on the man with way too much power and who almost succeeded taking over the world.<br />
<br />
But really, what else does Kakashi do with him? Put Obito back in the T&amp;I jail cell that can't even hold him because he can teleport? And wow, what a fun discovery that was, learning that if they sealed Obito's eye Kakashi gets the knockback.<br />
<br />
So now Ox is Kakashi's private ANBU (and who knows why Kakashi let Sasuke out of prison too) along with a rotation of five other ANBU. Since it's peacetime, Kakashi basically just picks the ones recovering from injuries to make sure they have a steady income when ANBU missions have already declined so sharply.<br />
<br />
For an excursion out to Kumo, however, Kakashi shuffled things around to pick the five ANBU that would compliment him and Obito best in a fight. Also, they can keep a straight face when Kakashi starts bullshitting other Kages about oh yes, Obito is under control - who, Sasuke, oh yes very obedient - by the way, super glad you trusted Konoha with two horribly unstable Uchiha.<br />
<br />
And so -understandably- on the way to Kumo, Kakashi tries to stall a bit.<br />
<br />
He stops to have a staring contest with a lizard on a tree, loses his hat, hi-fives a passing ANBU squad, stops for tea, loses his hat again-<br />
<br />
&quot;Bakashi, I swear, did you see what I did to Madara? Because I'm about to do that to you.&quot; Ox drops down in front of Kakashi and blocks off his random wandering.<br />
<br />
Kakashi rolls his eyes because wow, Obito really takes it seriously. Obito is single handedly the reason why Kakashi didn't frisbee the Hokage hat at Naruto as soon as Konoha was stable after rebuilding from the war.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll take a day to Kumo at our full speed, we won't be late,&quot; Kakashi dismisses.<br />
<br />
Ox takes a deep breath. &quot;I know you hate being stuck in your office, and we can do whatever the hell you want on the way back, but this trip has been planned for months. All the diplomats are already over there-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a paperwork ninja,&quot; Kakashi complains. &quot;I'm atrophying, Obito.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ox pauses, the white mask staring into Kakashi's soul. &quot;You get one more dumb thing and then we go to Kumo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One thing,&quot; Kakashi promises and points sideways. &quot;Something smells weird over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don't,&quot; Koala chimes in because she remembers what happened last time Kakashi followed his nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;You,&quot; Ox begins, roughly pulling the robe onto Kakashi properly. &quot;Stay in the middle like a good Hokage. I'll lead.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the brief second before Kakashi's Mangekyo rips through the fabric of reality with it's forced activation, Kakashi realises that the fallen stone pillars and rocks were in fact a large seal.<br />
<br />
Tobirama's head snaps up with the sudden influx of chakra and it's so strong he winces, making Hashirama's explanation stutter to a stop.<br />
<br />
The Hokage leans across the table to his brother. &quot;Do we need to send someone out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Madara drops the papers to the table in front of him and stretches his arms up with a groan. &quot;Let's go ourselves, I need a break.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tobirama's gaze is still focused on something off in the distance. &quot;There is...hm, yes I think we need to be the ones to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
The trees are carved open, the ground lashed apart. It takes a moment to realise that the markings form a massive spiral, centred on a man curled on his side and lying in a nest made of his white robe.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's not wearing armour,&quot; Hashirama points out as they pause shortly in the tree branches after they come across the scene. Not any kind of plated armour Hashirama is used to.<br />
<br />
&quot;None that we can see,&quot; Tobirama corrects. &quot;It could be under his clothes. Or he could be from a clan that doesn't wear armour.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madara peers around a tree to glare at Hashirama. &quot;If you try to help him up and he tries to stab you like the last time-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know!&quot; Hashirama interrupts with an eye roll. &quot;Okay, fine, you two are as bad as each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tobirama and Madara start stalking over each other about how Hashirama keeps leaving himself open and it's fine if he wants to be friendly but some caution is needed-<br />
<br />
Hashirama just jumps out of the tree and approaches the unconscious man. The man has silver hair instead of white, so probably not albino like Tobirama, with a mask and a headband that has a stylised leaf that looks pretty cool. Hashirama wished he'd thought of that one first.<br />
<br />
Navy pants and top, a black and grey vest with a high collar that is definitely reinforced. Fingerless gloves, hightop sandals, a weapons pouch. There's nothing really defining, not like the Senju or Uchiha clan symbols splashed over everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a Hatake,&quot; Madara guesses, crossing his arms. &quot;We're going to have to reinforce guard patrols if those animals are nearby. Strange that he's alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're never alone.&quot; Tobirama looks around at the massive spiral. &quot;Was it a fight or some kind of ritual?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do the Hatake even believe in gods?&quot; Madara scoffs, couching down to flip open the weapons pouch on the man's thigh and hoping for a convenient scroll with mission parameters. &quot;I'm quite certain cannibals aren't welcome anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three leap back, weapons snapping into their hands even before they land as another figure hurtles from the surrounding trees and lands in a low crouch above the Hatake with red lines painting a wide grin across the man's mask. Another in the same uniform bursts from the trees in the opposite direction and lands in front of the partner, taking up a stance.<br />
<br />
Hashirama scans the odd clothes -black skin-tight inner layer beneath white armour, smiling masks- and assumes they might have been the ones to run the Hatake down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're trespassing on Konoha territory,&quot; Tobirama calls out. &quot;Which clan are you from?&quot;<br />
<br />
An earth wall is pulled up and sent flying towards them, Madara cutting straight through it while Tobirama and Hashirama vault over.<br />
<br />
The Hatake and the two others are gone.<br />
<br />
Kakashi wakes slowly on the ground, a headache pounding through him, loud enough that it takes a while for Kakashi to hear the voices of his ANBU.<br />
<br />
&quot;-left him alone!&quot; Ox snaps.<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a second group coming from the north,&quot; Lizard explains evenly. &quot;I didn't know if I could move the Rokudaime, you saw the patterns, I didn't - I led the patrol away and got back as fast as I could.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were touching him when I got there, no one should be able to get that close.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was touching me?&quot; Kakashi slurs.<br />
<br />
The ANBU mercifully go quiet and Kakashi blinks his eyes open to an afternoon sky bracketed by trees, lying on the dirt with Ram sitting above him on a tipped over log, the man's legs stretched out either side.<br />
<br />
Ram reaches down and pulls Kakashi up by the upper arms, sitting the Hokage back against the ANBU's stomach. Kakashi hooks his arms over the man's thighs and accepts the water passed to him.<br />
<br />
Ox is pacing around in agitation. Lizard is tense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Report,&quot; Kakashi orders after he pulls his mask back up and hands Ram the canteen.<br />
<br />
Ox and Lizard drop to a knee.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Kakashi interrupts. &quot;I don't care. My head hurts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ox levers himself back up but Lizard drops lower onto her hands and knees in apology.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hokage,&quot; Ox begins. &quot;According to Ram's check up-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Skip,&quot; Kakashi says because Ram is the medic so it's all going to be information Kakashi doesn't care about right now.<br />
<br />
Ox switches tracks immediately. &quot;We're in the woods of Fire country, between the Nara and Akimichi clans who are currently moving into a newly made Konoha, the timeline approximately at the end of the Warring Clans Era. Dragonfly and Koala are currently maintaining patrol around the perimeter, Badger has left to gather more information.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lizard speaks up next. &quot;I was closest when we arrived in this timeline, and located you. I then saw a patrol group coming towards us and made the decision to lead them away instead of moving you from the large Kamui spiral centred around you. The - the Shodaime, Nidaime and Madara found you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that why you're still on the ground?&quot; Kakashi muses. &quot;Because I think it'd be more helpful if you were collecting information with Badger instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ox tenses. &quot;Hokage, in light of her actions taking care of you, I made the decision to detain Lizard until-&quot;<br />
<br />
Kakashi lifts a hand and Ox shuts up. &quot;Are you the captain of my personal guard, Ox?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Hokage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why are you wasting time berating a solid decision, to the point where you overlook the fact that Lizard is a Nara, and we are next to the Nara compound.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;She left you vulnerable in front of Madara!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Kakashi sighs. &quot;Lizard, go meet up with Badger. You have four hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lizard nods and disappears into the trees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Obito,&quot; Kakashi says, leans his head back against the solid armour on Ram's stomach. &quot;I understand why you're overreacting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not overreacting,&quot; Ox mutters, starts pacing again. &quot;The motherfucker was touching you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you honestly telling me that Madara Uchiha was molesting me while Hashirama and Tobirama were watching on in perverse enjoyment-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Ox snaps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Were they tying me up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Were they messing with our eye? Suspicious of my clothing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...no.&quot; Ox stops and crosses his arms. &quot;I don't want him close to you. I'm gonna go kill him later,&quot; he mutters petulantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would ruin the timeline,&quot; Kakashi points out. He blinks and rubs a hand over his eyes with a wince.<br />
<br />
&quot;According to Ram's check up,&quot; Ox says, firmer this time. &quot;There were no injuries sustained by the transport here -what we assume to be a seal- but we all blacked out and our Sharingans show signs of trauma.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both of them?&quot; Kakashi asks, slumping down as Ram massages his temples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you tried going back to our time with Kamui?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and I was thrown out and started bleeding from my eye,&quot; Ox admits. &quot;You shouldn't try it, not until I have more information. Koala tried summoning her possum contracts too, it didn't work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember the seal?&quot; Kakashi asks, pulling out a scroll where he keeps miscellaneous supplies.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can draw most of it but I don't know how well,&quot; Ox admits, coming to sit beside Kakashi and gathering paper and ink towards himself. &quot;Oh, and by the way, congratulations. You've lost the Hokage hat for good this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kakashi does a little fist pump.<br />
<br />
&quot;That does not mean you stop being Hokage though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea what this part says,&quot; Kakashi tells his ANBU after deconstructing as much of the seal as he can, several scrolls of paper now lying beside him with maybes and what-ifs. &quot;Also this is definitely wrong, and that one I can't tell if it's to throw me off or if it's a vital part of the seal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could have drawn it wrong,&quot; Ox allows, sitting on the ground next to Kakashi while everyone except Ram still on his log forms the rest of the ANBU circle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are Uzu still alive?&quot; Badger wonders. &quot;We can steal a seal master. I'm great with torture.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard Mito Uzumaki is going to be heading to Konoha soon,&quot; Lizard volunteers in an even tone. &quot;We can kidnap her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And piss off the Shodaime by stealing his wife?&quot; Koala points out logically. &quot;If we're going to go that far, we might as well grab the Nidaime himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kakashi stares down at the seal on the paper written in Obito's shaky hand. &quot;We're going to be late to Kumo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck Kumo anyway,&quot; Badger scoffs. &quot;I want to kill Madara.&quot;<br />
<br />
Badger and Ox hi-five.<br />
<br />
Dragonfly tilts her head. &quot;Wait, why don't we just walk into Konoha and demand a seal master take a look at it? Like we have the Rokudaime right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We might upset the future,&quot; Koala points out.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can all dress in ANBU gear, not give away our identity, that kind of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might snap and kill Madara,&quot; Ox admits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, can we kill Zetsu right now?&quot; Badger asks. &quot;Or like the ten-tails statue?&quot;<br />
<br />
Koala sighs heavily. &quot;I don't know how that could work, but I'll put it on the list if we have time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dragonfly turns to Kakashi. &quot;What do you think, Hokage? Willing to throw down with the Shodaime?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kakashi doesn't answer in time and the silence drags out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Badger asks, leaning forward. &quot;Come on, there's no Yamanaka here, we're not going to pick at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kakashi sighs but it still takes a while to put the words together. &quot;I'm so weak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dragonfly splutters. &quot;If you're weak, I'm a career genin. What do you think of ANBU, huh? Are we nothing to you, senpai.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm the weakest Kage in history,&quot; Kakashi corrects.<br />
<br />
&quot;You,&quot; Koala tries. &quot;I mean, you rebuilt a hidden village damn near from scratch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kakashi sighs again, slumps forward with his elbows on his thighs. &quot;I just...need to mentally prepare myself for how humiliating it's going to be when I'm inevitably asked to spar and the Shodaime puts me on my ass in under a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ANBU captain at thirteen-&quot; Dragonfly continues.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Kakashi cries, sits back against Ram. &quot;Fine, I'm really incredibly strong. If I had tried a little harder I could have slapped Kaguya back to the moon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dragonfly didn't mean it like that,&quot; Badger soothes. &quot;But also, you deserve to be gaslighted because your opinion is wrong and your feelings aren't valid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kakashi drags a hand down his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to fight the Shodaime,&quot; Ox declares, and continues right over Kakashi's protests. &quot;No, Kakashi, you need to fight him so you know how strong you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't use our Sharingan,&quot; Kakashi points out. &quot;Which means I'm even weaker - and if I pass out from chakra exhaustion in front of him, I'm going to have to dishonourably discharge myself from being the fucking Hokage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dragonfly clears her throat but it still sounds like a laugh. &quot;Alright, we won't force you. It's fine. You're allowed to be upset.&quot;<br />
<br />
Upon venturing further out, more towards the coast, Dragonfly finds a rather small (but for this time period a relatively large) merchant town to gather supplies and information.<br />
<br />
Kakashi walks the streets with Badger at his back, his other ANBU all in civilian gear that they've stolen, already spread out through the crowd. The civilians stare, a couple with grimaces on their face, more tense and backing away, watching Kakashi like he's liable to snap.<br />
<br />
Kakashi stops at a meat vendor to point at a package because protein bars only go so far and ANBU don't carry anything else.<br />
<br />
The seller scoffs, his arms crossed. &quot;I sell beef.&quot; He leans forward with a sneer. &quot;I ain't got nothing you'll like, Hatake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kakashi keeps his expression bland, doesn't laugh like he wants to. &quot;It's not for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man glare for a moment longer then wraps it up, charges far too much.<br />
<br />
Kakashi hands over the (stolen) money and takes the paper package before walking off until he can duck into a quieter place between two stables.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck was that?&quot; Ox hisses, dropping down beside him, wrestling slightly with the uncomfortable civilian clothing that does not lend itself to ninja movement. He's wrapped in a cloak as well to hide his scarring because it makes him stand out too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should go,&quot; Kakashi says. &quot;I'll wait near the river with Badger, the rest of you collect the supplies we need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do they hate you because you're Hatake?&quot; Ox asks, confused and pissed off and he makes an interesting expression at the mix.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maa,&quot; Kakashi looks up and sighs. &quot;Hatake are nomads that...hm, how do I put this? My clan's white chakra is capable of absorbing...ah...&quot; Kakashi looks back at Ox. &quot;I could have eaten your eye instead and still had a chance of developing a Sharingan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ox pauses. &quot;If you eat my plant half, will you get mokuton?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd probably have to eat a lot, the likelihood varies significantly depending on what part you eat and what ability you're after,&quot; Kakashi explains blandly. &quot;Dad made me eat a lot of Kumo to develop my lightning release further, and I accidentally got a small bloodline ability that makes me extra flexible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck,&quot; says Badger who does not want to be a part of this conversation.<br />
<br />
A group of civilians turn the corner, make-shift weapons in hand and looking scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's my cue,&quot; Kakashi mutters and puts on a show of angrily shoving past Ox, storming off and launching himself over another row of market stalls, disappearing into the forest with Badger.<br />
<br />
Ox has to wave off the merchants by insisting he just wanted to start some shit with the Hatake, and then he leaves before he punches someone for insulting Kakashi.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to talk about the Hatake thing,&quot; Koala points out while they all take inventory. &quot;Because I'm not sure if we can just walk into Konoha now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can dye my hair,&quot; Kakashi offers up. &quot;I'm already hiding a Sharingan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dragonfly shrugs. &quot;Maybe someone else can play Hokage and Rokudaime can be a normal ANBU?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ox scoffs. &quot;We're not hiding Kakashi just because every part of him is offensive to people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Obito,&quot; Kakashi deadpans. &quot;May I remind you that this is our eye? It takes two to tango, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Badger shrugs. &quot;We're already planning on walking in there and fucking with people, we might as well bring our cannibal Hokage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ram just shakes his head. This is going to be a disaster.<br />
<br />
There's nothing else coming for this story, I just really wanted to write long-suffering ANBU Obito and Gai drifting his wheel chair.<br />
<br />
Also cannibal Hatake which is my favourite.<br />
<br />
<br />
(See the end of the chapter for notes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
The current Konoha is still noticeably split into clans that don't quite mingle unless necessary, still a bit worried about people taking their secrets. Konoha doesn't have civilian merchants and certainly not ninja with civilian background either at this time, otherwise it would have been easy to just slip in and wander around when needed.<br />
<br />
The game plan of this last week has been for Lizard and Koala to infiltrate the baby Konoha to keep an eye on the situation. As two of the calmest ANBU Kakashi has on hand, and as clan shinobi, they blend in well to the background and it no longer matters if Tobirama can sense them.<br />
<br />
They sent a scroll straight to Tobirama - through the proper channels because they're trying to be as non-threatening as possible and paperwork is as amicable as ninja get.<br />
<br />
Tobirama took one look at the request for a seal master to assist and then rejected it outright. They send one more each time Tobirama rejects the previous, escalating it to leaving scrolls on his office desk in his house.<br />
<br />
Tobirama is definitely on high alert and is investigating anyone who came into contact with the request scroll but it's not his fault there are, at most, a handful of people ANBU-capable.<br />
<br />
The infiltrators Lizard and Koala have been relaying their sparring against other clan members and so far it's been interesting...in how weak everyone is. And how surprised they are when one of Kakashi's ANBU pulls out a very simple parry with a kunai, which apparently just can't be defended against in this time?<br />
<br />
It makes sense in hindsight because three ninja wars later (and the boost in techniques and tactics that accompany an entire continent's struggle to make mass slaughter ever more efficient) means Kakashi's ANBU have an incredibly unfair advantage.<br />
<br />
It's several generations of progress in making the lower limit of genin higher than most of the average ninja in this era. Most average ninja here have two dozen jutsu at most, with maybe a total of thirty clan jutsu and nothing else because there's very little trade between clans, even with allies like Ino-Shika-Cho.<br />
<br />
They haven't been pushed to be faster or stronger and don't have the taijutsu knowledge to be able to combat techniques Academy kids should know. They don't have statistics but it would be interesting to see how many can use anything other their base elemental nature in ninjutsu - do they even know they can build up experience with others natures?<br />
<br />
This disconnect between timelines is also a major reason why they're not being as subtle as they could be - but there is a difference between average ninja and the damn Shodaime so they're not exactly kicking the door down either.<br />
<br />
Or at least that's the plan.<br />
<br />
Tobirama does a hard double take when a scroll suddenly appears on his office desk in what is being called the Hokage tower.<br />
<br />
He lurches out of his chair and whips around, concentrating on the chakra in his area but there's nothing noticeable in the usual chaos of the Hokage tower - no one moving quickly or forming jutsu or even suppressing their chakra.<br />
<br />
He grits his teeth and snatches up the scroll, ready to just hurl it out of the window but pauses as he realises the scroll is much lighter, not as tightly wound. He rips it open and it's coordinates, a day out of Konoha as well as a message.<br />
<br />
[Come alone and your brother won't be hurt.]<br />
<br />
Tobirama pauses and immediately tries to locate the bright burn of his brother's chakra but Hashirama is out of the village to scan through the large perimeter around the village, to grow more trees and set up clearly denoted lines for their territory.<br />
<br />
Tobirama tries to find Madara next but who knows where that man has gotten off to. Tobirama is absolutely certain this is a bluff, there's no possible way they've caught Hashirama - who only Madara can match even across all the clans they've gathered so far.<br />
<br />
But to threaten Konoha, to threaten Tobirama's brother, is a bold and very dangerous move. The scrolls were acceptable as it only affected him, but this is going too far.<br />
<br />
Tobirama shoves open his door and looks across the floor to where Madara's and Hashirama's offices are. &quot;Where is Madara?&quot;<br />
<br />
Madara's assistant looks up and he blinks. &quot;He's stepped out for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't sense him,&quot; Tobirama snaps. &quot;When did he leave?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Uchiha purses his lips. &quot;He isn't here, would you like to leave a message?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Senju in front of Hashirama's office bristles and the Nara sitting in the desk beside Tobirama's door raises an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
Tobirama slams the scroll down on the Nara's desk. &quot;Give this to Madara when he gets back. I'll be leaving the village.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kakashi -dressed in full ANBU Hound gear just in case he gets recognised and yeeted out of Konoha as a toddler in the future from disrespecting the Shodaime- is standing with his arms crossed in a small clearing they've fixed up for themselves, uncaring about leaving evidence as it's common practice for small family merchant groups to move by in this era's unregulated Fire country.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can someone please explain to me how we fucked this up so badly?&quot; Kakashi demands.<br />
<br />
Kakashi stands in the middle of the flat ground. On each side of the camp is a Konoha founder, tied sitting up against a tree with ninja wire around their wrists and chakra seals pasted over their foreheads, still unconscious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so to begin,&quot; Ox tries, kneeling with the other ANBU except for the village infiltrators, in front of Kakashi. &quot;We did follow the plan to watch Hashirama, except he finished too early and started heading back so I made the decision to engage as a distraction to stall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, why did you then turn 'engage' into 'kidnap'?&quot; Kakashi demands.<br />
<br />
&quot;He went down really hard,&quot; Badger admits. &quot;Like maybe we went in too enthusiastically.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ox shrugs. &quot;And I couldn't leave him there in case someone came by to kill him - and then Madara showed up as we were dragging Hashirama off, and we couldn't just leave Madara because he'd run back to Konoha and it'd be a whole situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kakashi sighs. &quot;If this is a plot to get me to fight the Shodaime, I will demote all of you to genin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pinky promise it's not,&quot; Ox swears as the other ANBU are shifty-eyed behind their masks.<br />
<br />
Kakashi rolls his eyes. &quot;When Tobirama comes, we'll split off - Ram, Badger and Dragonfly, get these two back to outside Konoha, release them and just run. Get back here and we'll pretend threatening Tobirama's brother was a bluff and hopefully he won't find out until after he's made us a seal to get home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Koala bursts out of the trees, dropping onto the ground panting hard. &quot;He's two minutes out - I forgot he had hirashin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck - scatter!&quot; Kakashi snaps.<br />
<br />
Tobirama slowly makes his way closer across the ground, locked onto the three chakra spots in the space up ahead. Two are muted, a bit more contained than he's ever seen them, and the third is a blank whiteness of the few Hatake Tobirama has seen.<br />
<br />
Hashirama is tied to a tree, arms pulled back and wrists tied by something thin but glinting, maybe metallic. His head has fallen forward and he seems to be uninjured - and not low on chakra, so it must have been an ambush that caught him.<br />
<br />
Madara is tied across from Hashirama and why the hell is Madara this far out of the village without warning?!<br />
<br />
Tobirama has the sudden thought that he should have made sure Madara was in the village. Now it's undefended, possibly being attacked right now by people who are strong enough to take down these two powerhouses - and fine, Tobirama can admit he panicked reading the note but he should have had more control than to run off.<br />
<br />
The man crouched on the ground going through a pack stands up, his back to Tobirama, a familiar shock of silver hair and dressed in the tight black clothes and white armour of the two Tobirama remembers seeing earlier. They were on the same side then.<br />
<br />
The man, Hatake, starts forming hand signs and his chakra weaves, focused on the pack and not the two shinobi so Tobirama waits, hidden behind the trees and tense.<br />
<br />
The chakra expands at first like a widespread jutsu, maybe an earth style, but slowly spirals as it condenses. Tobirama follows it closely, tensing every time it flickers suddenly toward Hashirama's direction. It grows tighter and Tobirama closes his eyes to focus better because it seems like it might be-<br />
<br />
Kakashi knows six jutsu to overload a sensor.<br />
<br />
Madara wakes up, sees Tobirama and Hashirama tied to trees in an empty camp, can't access his own chakra - and promptly throws a fit that wakes the other two.<br />
<br />
To be fair, ninja wire hasn't been invented yet. But Madara keeps yanking at his wrists as he rises up to a knee and the thin but incredibly strong wire just cuts straight into his flesh. Tobirama sees this and wraps the minute slack around his fingers, scraping it back and forth so it starts cutting into his tree behind him despite it also creating tears into his fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Madara, your wrists!&quot; Hashirama cries in worry, pressing his hands to the tree he's tied to and pauses in shock when he realises that his chakra is sealed as well and mokuton won't help here.<br />
<br />
Madara and Tobirama are genuinely just a few seconds from brute forcing their way out when Kakashi drops down beside Hashirama, one hand grabbing the man's (luscious) hair while he holds a kunai to the Shodaime's throat. The other two go still as Kakashi's hound mask tilts in warning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ram, would you mind?&quot; Kakashi asks.<br />
<br />
Ram appears to fix Madara's wrists because the man is bleeding out but doesn't seem to feel it through the rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don't make this difficult, I won't have to escalate,&quot; Kakashi states. &quot;My friends and I have been displaced in time and we need a seal master to assist us - as we stated in our request form to you, Tobirama. Nice to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hashirama scans the clearing, spotting another two masked people up in the trees and there must be more he can't sense with his chakra blocked. He keeps his voice soft and even. &quot;I'm sure you didn't need to go this far. If you'd explain your si</td>

<br />
The raspy, high-pitched voice made Harry freeze in place, his body bent over and his fingertips brushing thin paper. He looked up and blinked across the hall, sleep dust still lingering in the corners of his eyes. <br />
<br />
He studied the short, crumpled man slouching against the doorframe opposite his flat. His tight, black skinnies sagged off his round arse, a slate grey long-sleeved tee clinging to his lean torso. He wasn't even wearing shoes or socks on his pudgy feet, scuffed black Vans dangling from dirty shoelaces tied around the strap of his band button-covered rucksack.<br />
<br />
In the split second of study, Harry tried to remember if he'd pulled pants on before opening the door that morning to retrieve his newspaper. A cool breeze confirmed that, luckily, he had pulled on plaid pajama bottoms and a baggy Rolling Stones t-shirt, his nipples prickling against the thin material.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; he rasped, his voice heavy. &quot;I'm a person.&quot; He stood up straight, his right hand pushing his long waves off his face. &quot;I'm a Harry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Small lips quirked upwards, sleepy eyes crinkling at the edges.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a Louis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you, a Louis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis' smile grew, his arms crossing over his chest. His rucksack strap sagged off his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Louis is fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry tapped his newspaper against his opposite palm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Louis then,&quot; Harry said, Louis' rapid-fire chuckle bouncing around the empty hallway. &quot;Well,&quot; Harry jutted his head back into his flat, the warmth of bed beckoning him, &quot;I'll see you around, Just Louis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, definitely.&quot; Louis made no move to leave, his tongue toying with the simple silver hoop pierced through the left side of his bottom lip. &quot;Sorry if I startled you, by the way. Totally didn't mean to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't realize anyone had moved in across the hall.&quot; His mouth twitched into a smirk. &quot;You're a quiet neighbor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I, erm...Sorry.&quot; Harry squeezed the rolled newspaper between his hands. &quot;I'm not much of a morning person on weekends. Usually I'm a lot more polite. I'm kind of out of it right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same, except,&quot; Louis rubbed his hand over his face, stubble scratching under his palm, &quot;it's every day that I'm not a morning person, not exclusively weekends. Working nights was the only option. I'm gonna sleep for, like,&quot; he yawned and stretched his arms up, &quot;twelve hours straight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're getting in now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. I own the tattoo shop down the block and we're open crazy hours on weekends. Tattoo Zou, if you've seen it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry tried to remember what anything looked like besides the inside of his bare flat and the direct path to work. He drew a blank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; he murmured. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry leaned his shoulder against his doorframe, doing another quick glance over Louis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not many tattoos for a professional.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis quirked an eyebrow as he tongued his lip ring, pushing his sleeves up to his elbows. It revealed a multitude of ink, mostly black outlines, but some pieces coloured in with red, his tattoos varying from detailed, shaded birds to the simplest of stick figures. The slivers of his bare, un-inked skin were lightly tanned, his muscles wiry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; Harry said, nodding, studying a skull and bones on Louis' delicate wrist. &quot;Cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any ink for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; Harry said, rubbing his hand over forearm. The downy hair that dusted his skin stood up at attention; their hallway was very drafty. &quot;I'm not much for needles and I work with kids. Don't think it would work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I'm a teacher. Early years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis smiled and tapped his fist against his doorframe. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww,&quot; he drawled, his pitch fluctuating. &quot;Cute!&quot; Harry's face flushed at that comment, Louis hurrying to add, &quot;And you're not alone. With the needles thing. I had to close my eyes for my first few tattoos. But then...&quot; He licked his lip ring and hitched his bag higher, his shoes clunking against the wall. &quot;You get used to it.&quot; His eyes shimmered. &quot;The pain is kind of addicting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have boring addictions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry smiled and ran his fingers through the back of his hair, his socked toes digging into the cool tile floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing special. I, uh, should,&quot; he gave Louis one more small smile and gestured back to the open door of his flat, &quot;I'll see you around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure, enjoy your weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry heard Louis' door unlock and creak open, both of their doors mere inches from closing when Louis called, &quot;Oh, hey,&quot; across the hall. Harry turned back to him. &quot;How long have you been here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just about a month.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A month!?&quot; Louis laughed, his eyes bulging. The movement drew Harry's attention to Louis' eyes, electric blue and sparkling. &quot;Shit, man. I had no idea. Sorry I didn't introduce myself. I've been working a lot. My business partner got married and I've been covering the shop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries. I've been sort of...Ghosting around, myself. Still getting settled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I should have gotten you, like, a casserole or something. Well,&quot; Louis bobbed his head side to side, &quot;I could have learned to make a casserole and then given it to you. That's neighborly, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fine. I don't even like casseroles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry studied him for a long beat, the back of his neck heating. Louis stared at him with such warmth, such rapt attention, that it caused his insides to tremble a touch. Ghosting for a month and focusing on work almost made him forget what it felt like to be chatted up by a stranger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um,&quot; he chuckled again, breathier, his eyes cast at the ground, &quot;I'll, uh, answer that when I'm more awake. I'm sort of fading fast. Haven't been sleeping well in the new space.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis smiled easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing. Get lots of sleep.&quot; He held up one hand. &quot;See you around, mate. Let me know if you need any help settling in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, thanks,&quot; Harry said, mirroring his motionless wave. &quot;See you.&quot;<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
One thing Harry learned about his new home was that the lift was a sacred space not meant for loud noises and chit chat. Early mornings were near silent, people still half-asleep as they rode the lift to start their long, exhausting day. Those same people usually rode the lift eight hours later, even quieter and more braindead.<br />
<br />
Harry preferred to doze off in the corner of the lift with his earbuds in and his hood pulled over his head. Maybe that was why he'd only met one neighbor for approximately five minutes since moving into the building.<br />
<br />
He returned home after a long day and saw a white box resting in front of his door. He looked around the hallway and bent over, picking up the box. There was no postage on it, only his name scrawled in elegant, looping black calligraphy, a red heart drawn around his name. The heart was lopsided, the right peak slightly higher than the left. <br />
<br />
His eyes rolled around the hallway, checking for any sign of a delivery person. The hallway was empty, not even the sound of a television on from behind a closed door.<br />
<br />
Harry pulled the top of the box off, the calming smell of vanilla and milk floating to his nostrils. He smiled with furrowed brows and lifted the round white candle out out of the box. The candle was poured into what looked like a vintage milk glass, the scent warm and soothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sleep,&quot; he read aloud, thumbing over the printed label. The paper was bumpy and cream coloured, a shade darker than the pure white candle. &quot;Huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked around one more time before he opened the door to his flat. That night, he lit the surprise candle while getting ready for bed. He slept the full night for the first time since moving in.<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
Harry was roused from sleep a few days later by a single bang on his front door. His eyes shot open, his hands clutching the pillow under his face. He blinked at his alarm clock and frowned, pushing his face deeper into his pillow. Then the bang came again, Harry huffing a breath out of his nose.<br />
<br />
He pulled himself out of bed and stomped to the door. He looked out the peephole and saw nothing. Something was blocking his view. He unlocked the door, pulled it open two inches, and peeked out the gap. <br />
<br />
There was a note taped to the front of his door. <br />
<br />
<br />
Traffic. Crazy delays. Better get an early start! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Harry's sleep rumpled face grew ever more wrinkled, his lips pursed forward. He sighed and shut the door, shuffling into the kitchen. He was up already; might as well give up on sleep and get ready for his day, even if he'd arrive at work very early.<br />
<br />
Later, after a jam-packed drive to school that delivered him a comfortable fifteen minutes early, he sat in the teacher's lounge and sipped his vanilla latte, watching other frantic employees running in late. He thought of the little note and smiled, running his tongue over the vanilla-sweet inside of his bottom lip.<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis turned away from his door, his keys clutched in his hand and his rucksack hanging off his shoulders. A big smile brightened his face, his tongue swiping once over his lip ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, man.&quot; He adjusted a full grocery bag balanced against his chest, glancing over Harry's body. Today, he was wearing a pale blue Oxford tucked into his dark, skinny jeans, his chocolate brown boots spotless. &quot;What's up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much,&quot; Harry drew small circles in the back of his hair, &quot;just,&quot; he seemed lost for words for a moment, &quot;uh, settling in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis leaned back on his door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tired of being a ghost?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something like that. Hey,&quot; Harry said, softer, stepping closer. &quot;Um, this is probably a weird question, but have you seen anyone, um, lurking around my door?&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis' standard smirk slid into a full-blown, wildly amused grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lurking?&quot; he said, drawing out the word. He made a spooky motion with his fingers. &quot;Luuuurking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, like, uh,&quot; Harry ran his hand over the top of his head, stifling a smile, &quot;people dropping packages off? Or leaving notes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis shook his head, his mouth pursed forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, sorry, man. I haven't noticed anything. I haven't been here a lot, though, so maybe I'm not the best person to ask. I've been sleeping at the shop most days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. Alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll keep an eye out, though. If I'm around, I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry nodded, &quot;Thanks. Sorry to even ask. That's--That's such a weird thing to ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, it's alright. Our building is kind of quiet most of the time. It's weird you can't hear them coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right!&quot; Harry said, his eyes widening. &quot;That's exactly...That's what...&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis' brows furrowed, his head tilting.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry tore his eyes away from Louis' chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot; He nodded again, jerkier. &quot;That's what I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis looked down his own body, a smile working its way onto his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, this?&quot; he asked, pushing the grocery bag into his right arm. The motion caused his black Skate Tough tank to stretch further across his chest, revealing a sliver of his chest not covered by his tank or black hoodie. &quot;Not much for piercings, either?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry's face shook while he blurted out, &quot;No, I don't care, I just wasn't expecting it. Your nipples are your business.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis smirked wickedly, his nipple, and its shining silver barbell, on full display.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of guys get their nipples pierced these days. It,&quot; his tongue teased over his lip ring as he smiled, &quot;has many benefits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I'm sure,&quot; Harry said, laughing out the words. He put his hand over his lips to muffled the honked sound, Louis laughing loudly across the hall. &quot;Alright, well, thanks, um, yeah.&quot; He smiled at Louis, who was still smiling and leaning against his doorframe. &quot;I'll see you around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis winked and gripped his grocery bag, letting his shirt slide back across his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna have a beer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um,&quot; Harry said, nibbling his bottom lip. &quot;I should...I have to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis held one palm towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise to keep my nipples to myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
A sudden smile broke across Harry's face, his head ducking down and his hair falling in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, okay, sure,&quot; he said, looking up at Louis, who cried, &quot;Hells yes!&quot; in response. Harry smiled crookedly, smoothing his hand over his Oxford. &quot;Yours or mine? I need to neaten up a bit, if you want to come to mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis pushed his door open with his bum.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can probably smell my flat from here. I'm the last man on Earth to give a shit about cleanliness, unless I'm putting a needle in you. Then I'm Mister Clean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry sniffed the air as if he was a sommelier testing the bouquet of a fine wine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a combination of Cheetos, feet and weed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Close enough,&quot; Louis grinned, his lip ring shining. &quot;Come to think of it,&quot; he jostled the grocery bag in his arms, &quot;I just bought a sixer of this amazing Belgian beer and it's so fucking tasty. I can host this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, definitely. Then we can start drinking immediately, no tidying needed. If you can stomach my flat, that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, okay. Cool. Thanks,&quot; Harry huffed on a chuckle. &quot;Lemme just,&quot; he thumbed over his shoulder, &quot;grab my phone and keys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at you,&quot; Louis said proudly, his voice teasing and light, leaning back on his doorway. &quot;Making a non-ghost friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha,&quot; Harry said, his throat clucking the sound out. He stepped into his flat, the door slowly closing. &quot;I'll be over in...One second, just need to...&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice trailed off, the sound of an iPhone ringing filtering through the cracked door. Louis waited for him to come back, but he could only hear Harry's voice speaking quietly in tight tones.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already switched that one to you, I told you that. I did that before I even moved out.&quot; Harry paused for a beat, Louis' ear leaning closer to the sliver of open door. &quot;I paid you for the last month I lived there, and even gave you extra as a courtesy, but why--Why would you assume that? I haven't lived there in over two months. Why would I still owe you for...&quot; His voice dropped. &quot;No, of course not. This isn't about money, I just...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry sighed heavily, papers shuffling around behind the door. He was silent for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it's hard,&quot; he murmured, the private tone making Louis step backwards. Harry continued, &quot;It was hard at times for me, too, but it would really help if you'd do your part. I asked you to let me know if any of my mail was...&quot; <br />
<br />
He sighed again. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I'm not. I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm just saying, my mail's been forwarding perfectly fine to my new address for weeks, yet you always seem to have to meet to give me a magazine or a catalogue or something that you know is rubbish. It's not good for you and it's not good for me because--Because,&quot; he repeated, tension twinging his tone, &quot;I'm doing well, you're doing well, and it's not good for either of us to keep harping...&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice rose in volume. He was not even close to shouting, but spoke with more firmness than Louis could remember hearing in their short conversations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well, why am I still getting emails from Melly about the flat? You handed in the revised lease, yes? That's why we had that coffee meeting with her, so we could both....&quot; Harry sighed even heavier, Louis practically able to see him pinching the bridge of his nose. &quot;Then why didn't you tell her to contact you for future issues?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a quick clicking sound, as if fingertips were tapping on something, Harry's shoes slapping over the hardwood floor.<br />
<br />
Harry barked out a humorless laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn't you update the email on file to your email? I don't live there anymore and--And I'm trying to be patient, I'm trying keep things friendly, but I can't keep getting dragged back into things with you that have nothing to do with me. It's not healthy for either of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis' grocery bag wilted in his arms, discomfort from snooping weighing him down. He took a step forward and knocked gently on the door frame. <br />
<br />
The door swung open and Harry appeared, his eyes frazzled and his hair standing outwards in tufts. He had his phone balanced against his shoulder and an open laptop cradled in his arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Harry gasped, his eyes widening. He shifted his phone and whispered, &quot;Uh, just a--&quot;<br />
<br />
He gently placed his laptop on a small white table beside his door, switching his iPhone to his other hand. He held up one finger towards Louis, the sound of another voice buzzing through his phone loud enough for Louis to hear. Harry winced and held his hand over the bottom of the phone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he said quietly to Louis, clenching his teeth. &quot;I'll have to take a rain check on that beer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry's face fell and his eyes darted to the side to focus on whatever the person was saying on the other end. He blurted out, &quot;No, no, that's not--&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked back to Louis and clammed up, his mouth bobbing silently, the phone's voice buzzing again.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's cool, man, no worries,&quot; Louis whispered, giving him a small smile and two thumbs up. &quot;Another time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, thanks,&quot; Harry said, relieved but distracted, his eyes not even landing on Louis' face before he was turning away. <br />
<br />
Louis reached into his grocery bag and pulled out a bottle of beer. He looked up, holding a beer out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, how about I donate a beer to--&quot;<br />
<br />
The door closed in his face before he could finish his sentence. Louis froze for a second, staring at the door. He sucked on his lip ring and rolled back on his heels, tucking the beer back into his bag. <br />
<br />
As he turned back towards his flat, he could hear Harry's voice saying, &quot;Nobody. It was just the guy from across the hall,&quot; through the door, Louis sucking a touch harder on his lip ring.<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
The next morning, Harry woke up to three origami frogs sitting on his doormat. After the long night of back and forth conversations via phone, email, and eventually Facetime (with a person he didn't really care to see their face at all), he slept terribly. Waking up to cheerful paper frogs sitting in front of his door didn't quite bring a smile to his face, but he let out a quiet breath, the corners of his lips twitching upwards.<br />
<br />
He picked up the frogs and carefully tucked them into the front pocket of his leather messenger bag. He pulled a gray beanie over his hair and went towards the lift. There was one person waiting for the lift already, that person yawning loudly and stretching his arms high above his head, a sliver of his tan lower back revealed beneath his black leather jacket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Harry said softly.<br />
<br />
Louis tipped his head backwards, then whipped it sideways, smiling sleepily at Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, mate, alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I'm...I'm so sorry about last night. I was really rude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis burped, &quot;Nah,&quot; and swung his hand in the air. &quot;Not at all. You got busy.&quot; He shrugged, metal safety pins clinking together on the sleeves of his jacket. &quot;It happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I should have...Are you,&quot; Harry squinted and brought his face closer, &quot;wearing eyeliner?&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis' eyes fluttered in Harry's direction, the blue extra electric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, okay, right,&quot; Harry said, nodding quickly. &quot;What I meant to say, was that I shouldn't have made you stand in the hall and listen to me and my ex dealing with stuff over the phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, it's alright,&quot; Louis said on an easy laugh. He crossed his arms over his chest, glancing at the lit numbers above the lift. &quot;It's fine. You don't have to apologize.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I shouldn't have shut the door on you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Louis' neck flushed beneath his warm leather collar, his smile faltering for half a second. <br />
<br />
&quot;Harry--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Harry said softer, his throat bobbing. &quot;I was distracted, though that's no excuse for rudeness.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lift pinged on their floor with their eyes locked. The sleek metal doors sliding open. Louis held his arm out, Harry stepping first inside the crowded space. <br />
<br />
They ended up standing next to each other, wedged in the front left corner of the lift. Other riders sighed around them, the lift continuing to the next floor down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry to have disappeared like that,&quot; Harry whispered, mindful of the cranky crowd around them. He tried to angle his face towards Louis' ear just as the lift lulled, earning him a noseful of vanilla shampoo. &quot;I normally hate phone calls, but I had to take that particular one to straighten some things out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's totally cool, mate,&quot; Louis whispered back. &quot;Don't worry about it. I fully accept your apology.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry watched Louis' head bob as he spoke, his eyes dropping down below Louis' chest. Louis' phone was cradled in his hands. He apparently was playing some sort of pizza related game on his iPhone, his lips pursed forward and his pointer finger poking at his screen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, fuck,&quot; Louis muttered, a cheesy pizza exploding on his screen. He pocketed his phone and looked up to Harry with a smile. &quot;I always lose when the pepperonis come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure we're okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis' smile remained on his face, but his eyes clouded, a mix of concern and seriousness deepening his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry. You've just said more words to me in your apologies than in the actual conversations we've had. Was I bummed I didn't get to read another chapter in the Just Harry mystery series?&quot; His smile widened, his bottom lip pinched in his teeth for a beat. &quot;Yeah, of course. But, we're, like,&quot; he see-sawed his hand in the air, &quot;teetering on the brink of being friends. Friends understand that, sometimes, friends are stressed and have the unfortunate aspects of life to deal with. And that's fine. I'm just sorry you had a bad night.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lift landed one floor lower. The door pinged, people shuffling inside and pushing them even closer. Harry could smell the spicy nip of Louis' cologne, whatever product he had in his bed head scented like oranges. <br />
<br />
The lift started to move again. Harry brought his lips closer to Louis' ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though last night was kind of not good, I got another ghost gift today,&quot; Harry whispered. <br />
<br />
Louis gasped and turned his head as best he could, his arm stuck in a curled, cramped position against Harry's ribs. <br />
<br />
&quot;What'd you get?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry pulled one frog out of his bag, resting it in his palm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Three of these little guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Froggies!&quot; Louis cried, unbothered by the chorus of tired groans from the other people in the lift. &quot;Are they the jumpy kind? I think those are harder to make. Very impressive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Harry laughed softly, his brows furrowed. &quot;Jumpy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, like,&quot; Louis pressed his finger on the back of the frog and said, &quot;ah ha!&quot; He lifted his finger and the frog soared up to bounce into Harry's chin. &quot;They are! How cool.&quot; Louis plucked the frog from the collar of Harry's shirt and replaced it on his palm, making it jump again. &quot;Origami is an art, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Harry lifted the jumpy frog from the bottom waves of his hair, &quot;definitely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey, dunno if you saw this,&quot; Louis said, knocking his knuckle against a flyer taped to the lift wall. &quot;They do a little happy hour thing downstairs in the lobby once a month.&quot; Harry scanned over the flyer as Louis talked, the corporate flyer complete with misspellings and the obligatory clipart of a wine glass. &quot;I haven't gone for a couple of months, but they usually put out a pretty good spread.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. It starts at seven, and if you're not there by seven-oh-five, you'll likely go home empty handed. Cheese will literally fly off of the trays. But,&quot; he shrugged his shoulder, resulting in a warm slide of their outer arms, &quot;it's kind of fun. This building is huge, but most people who live here are really nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're nice when you're not blabbing at half seven in the bloody morning,&quot; came a grumbled, high pitched voice from the other corner of the lift. &quot;Insane skater boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hush, Gretchen. You love me,&quot; Louis said, grinning and lifting his head to wink her direction. &quot;Anyway,&quot; his smoky eyes landed on Harry's face, &quot;if you want to come, I'll be there. They have wine and sad beer, but it's free alcohol, nonetheless. And, hey,&quot; he nudged Harry's ribs with his elbow, his eyebrows wiggling, &quot;maybe your ghost will be there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha. Yeah, maybe,&quot; Harry said, a rush of heat pinking his cheeks. He placed his frog back in his bag, the lift pinging. &quot;We'll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
Louis ran down his hallway. He reached the lift in time to flail his arm at the closing doors, his fingers just missing the shrinking opening. A large hand flattened on the left door, pushing it open for him. Louis tumbled inside, landing with his back on the right wall. He peered at the person attached to the hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Louis said, blinking once. He smiled wide. &quot;Hi, neighbor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry smiled at him and quietly said, &quot;Hey,&quot; as he looked down at his tan boots. He smoothed his hands down his neat, red and white checkered shirt, which was tucked into his spotless black skinnies. His hair looked extra shiny and freshly brushed, shimmering in waves down to his shoulders.<br />
<br />
Louis noticed the ground level button was already lit up, his hands sliding into his pockets. He relaxed against the wall. He jutted his chin at the flyer taped to the lift.<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting there five minutes early?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I, um,&quot; Harry started to smile, glancing sideways at Louis, &quot;heard you need to be prompt if you want cheese.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like you're talking to the right people, Just Harry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Harry chuckled, biting his bottom lip. &quot;Sounds like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
For the next couple of weeks, Harry's surprise ghost gifts were small, thoughtful additions into his daily life.<br />
<br />
One evening, he came home with groceries. Upon entering the crowded lift, he realized that he forgot to buy milk, muttering to himself in the tight space while rifling through his grocery bag. Five minutes after getting inside his flat, there was a brisk knock at his door and a fresh bottle of milk on his doorstep, but no delivery person around long enough for him to catch them.<br />
<br />
He came home to a variety of presents left every other day or so. A small bundle of wild flowers left on his doorstep. A dark chocolate bar propped against the door. A fresh pair of cozy socks with smiling frogs on them wrapped around his door knob. An origami crane family balanced on top of his newspaper. <br />
<br />
One of his favourite ghost gifts was a steaming cup of tea and a hot blueberry scone from the bakery down the block on a Sunday morning, left far enough away from his doorway so as not to spill when Harry opened the door.<br />
<br />
All gifts were accompanied by the normal, lopsided red heart scrawled on some part of the present. Some even included a handwritten note in boxy, strong handwriting. The notes varied from lyrics to songs he'd never heard before to random daily thoughts to jokes that were so silly he couldn't help but laugh as he read them in the privacy of his flat.<br />
<br />
A part of him wondered if he should alert the building's management that someone had been sneaking in to leave gifts on his doorstep, but so far, the gifts were harmless. And sort of sweet. Each gift knocked away a brick in the wall surrounding his brain, letting out some of the sad, hazy smoke that had pooled in his skull.<br />
<br />
One morning, Harry woke to big, fat flakes of snow tumbling outside. He wrapped himself in his duvet and scooted to the side of his bed, peering out the foggy window. The entire city was coated fluffy white from the surprise storm, cars slowly meandering down the roads.<br />
<br />
He checked his phone to see if school was cancelled, but he had not received any sort of call or notification. He groaned and fell face first down to his pillows, pressing his face into the puffy clouds. <br />
<br />
He pulled on the warmest clothes he could find. He bundled up to the point of walking like a toddler in a stiff, over-stuffed snowsuit, his long limbs almost unable to bend at his knees and elbows. He'd have to use his mittens to push snow off his car windows and hope his wheels could handle the icy roads; he didn't take any shovels of car brushes from his old flat in the rush of moving.<br />
<br />
He reached his car and blinked, snow fluttering down to rest on the ends of his curls not covered by his moss coloured beanie.<br />
<br />
Every car parked on the street was still covered with snow, but his was completely cleaned off, save for a small heart of snow that had been left over the driver's side window. <br />
<br />
Harry stepped up to his car, snow crunching under his boots. He touched the fluffy snow shape with the end of his mitten, afraid to disturb the lopsided heart. His phone vibrated in his pocket and he fumbled to lift it with his snowy mittens. He clicked on the new text from one his school colleagues, a perky physical fitness teacher named Liam.<br />
<br />
<br />
snow dayyyyyy!!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
An email from his school popped up as he read the text, confirming that their school was closed due to poor weather. Harry huffed out a foggy breath, smiling down at the screen. <br />
<br />
He pocketed his phone and pulled his right mitten off. He used his pointer finger to write, &quot;Thanks! :)&quot; in the snow heart, his whole body buzzing. <br />
<br />
He waddled back into his building, rode the lift up to his floor, and waddled faster down the hall. He stood outside Louis' door and knocked, his mitten causing the sound to be muffled and dull. He pulled his mitten off with his teeth and knocked again.<br />
<br />
The door slowly opened to reveal Louis slouched over, a striped, knit blanket draped over his bare shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I under arrest?&quot; Louis croaked, his eyes still shut. &quot;At least let me make a cuppa before you haul me away, that's only polite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi!&quot; Harry chirped, clasping his mittens in front of his stomach. &quot;Do you want to make snow angels with me? As my only friend in this city, you're sort of obligated to.&quot; His green eyes glowed brighter. &quot;It's snowing, by the way! Oh, and, no.&quot; His voice simmered to a calmer tone. &quot;You're not under arrest, as far as I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis' eyes blinked open, his posture straightening. The blanket fell off his shoulders, revealing the lean muscles of his tattooed torso. His wiry frame was softened by a thin layer of pudge that lingered on his stomach and hips, a tiny silver ring pierced through the top of his navel. <br />
<br />
Harry's full body flush must have been due to the multiple layers of sweaters he had pulled on, not the sight of Louis topless in a pair of sagging gray and black Adidas sweats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Louis said, sounding a touch more awake. &quot;Can you come back in, like,&quot; he checked his watch, &quot;four hours?&quot; He squinted at Harry, itching his shin with his bare foot. &quot;Can we do it then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, c'mon, you're up already,&quot; Harry said, letting out a little laugh. &quot;If we wait, the snow might melt. And I have no school today, so I want to make the best of the whole day.&quot; He crooned, &quot;I'll buy you breakfast,&quot; and wiggled his eyebrows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, you're so fucking chipper, and a little bizarre, in the morning,&quot; Louis grumbled, though a smile licked at his lips. &quot;But I can't resist a free breakfast burrito and your froggy face.&quot; <br />
<br />
Harry gasped happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a place that sells breakfast burritos around here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have much to learn,&quot; Louis yawned, motioning for him to come inside. &quot;C'mon in. I'll put clothes on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry stepped into Louis' flat, Louis walking ahead of him with his blanket dragging along the floor. He closed the door and looked around. <br />
<br />
Louis' flat looked much like his own, a moderately sized one bedroom with a small sitting area and kitchen, though Harry's flat did not have clothes and dirty dishes dropped all over every available surface. <br />
<br />
The majority of Louis' kitchen appliances looked brand new, as if he'd never even turned on the oven. The only evidence that the kitchen had ever been used was a beat-up tin tea kettle on the stove and a collection of mugs in the sink, some tea bag labels hanging over the edges of the mugs.<br />
<br />
Sketch pads and an array of markers and coloured pencils were spread over his tiny kitchen table, crumpled papers and half completed sketches covering the surface. An old looking stereo system was propped on a shelf beside the table, CDs and CD cases balanced like a paused waterfall trickling from the top of the shelf and onto the messy table.<br />
<br />
&quot;You draw a lot?&quot; Harry asked, pushing a few pieces of paper aside.<br />
<br />
Louis' voice called back, &quot;Yeah, stuff for work. Ideas. That sort of thing.&quot; His words dropped to a low mumble of, &quot;Where are my bloody boots?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry continued to poke around the piles of sketches until Louis emerged from his bedroom. Louis stood in front of the table with his hands on his hips, his chest puffed out, an enormous white puffball bobbing on top of his knitted beanie. He had on polka-dot rainbow wellies, water squelching under the soles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhmm,&quot; Harry hummed, a pile of bird sketches fluttering to the kitchen table. &quot;Let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll warn you, wee snow angel. I'm a merciless snowball fighter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry's cheeks burned as he grinned, his boots tripping over themselves.<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
The next mysterious delivery came days later in the form of a burned CD slid under his door. There were handwritten lyrics on a folded piece of white paper tucked into the clear case, a lopsided red heart drawn in Sharpie on the face o</td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">&quot;Gross,&quot; Miruko says as she looks over his shoulder at the magazine spread. They have a TV appearance together about a job they just finished, and he's reading through an advance copy of a magazine interview to make sure everything looks okay while they wait. Hawks frowns down at the pictures of himself, wondering what problem she sees that he doesn't. There's a lot of wing and eye focus, but that's pretty standard. They are his most striking features, after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I don't think it came out too badly,&quot; he says. She makes a face at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want your ego stroked, get one of your fans to do it,&quot; she says mercilessly. &quot;They're so...fetish-y.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!&quot; he squawks, alarmed. He actually looks down at the pictures to check that they still look the way he remembers. He has no idea what she's talking about; it's not like he's tied up or wearing a questionable outfit, or anything. He's shirtless, sure, but he's wearing pants. He's done way worse photoshoots.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're practically naked except for the wings. Don't know why you let them pull that kind of thing so often.&quot; Hawks shifts uncomfortably on the couch, and Miruko reaches over to flip to the next page. More wing focus. &quot;If anyone tries to focus on my ears or tail that much I tell them to shove it,&quot; she says, like it's that easy. He frowns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your tail doesn't help you do your job, though,&quot; he argues. &quot;The wings are my entire appeal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't tell if you're fishing for compliments or just being an idiot,&quot; she says, poking his cheek. &quot;Look, I'm a bunny girl, I think I know what I'm talking about.&quot; Hawks grimaces. Even if he admits there's an issue with the way photographers shoot him--which he's not doing--there's a world of difference between the kind of treatment he gets and what she must deal with. Rabbits are the classic 'sexy' animal, except for maybe cats. Birds don't even rate in comparison. She's a woman, too. That has to make it worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;They don't tell me to take my shirt off because of the wings,&quot; he says patiently. Well, as patiently as he can. &quot;They tell me to take my shirt off because I'm in good shape from all the flying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miruko raises a skeptical eyebrow at him. &quot;Uh huh.&quot; She does not sound convinced.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is not photoshopped, I will have you know,&quot; he says, gesturing to a picture that has his back muscles on display.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good for you,&quot; she says flatly, barely glancing at it. &quot;This isn't, either.&quot; She holds up one arm and flexes, and he's privately impressed. She probably has more muscle mass for her height than he does. &quot;Doesn't mean that's what people are focusing on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They aren't--what does it even matter to you?&quot; he asks, and she pauses to consider that seriously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just thinking that something like that would really make me uncomfortable, that's all.&quot; She shrugs. &quot;Not my business if you want to be just a set of wings to the world, I guess.&quot; As if he has any choice which shoots to do or what they entail. He fights the urge to roll his eyes at the naivete of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're making me uncomfortable,&quot; he says petulantly, turning the page so he doesn't have to look at the spread anymore. She snorts out a laugh, wild and surprisingly loud, and he's oddly charmed by it. &quot;It's a demographic thing, too. Teenagers and twenty-somethings are a big percentage of my fans. You're mostly popular with little kids and housewives having a gay awakening.&quot; She cackles again, looking surprised. He gives her a lazy smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're alright, Hawks,&quot; she says, nudging him with her elbow. &quot;Think we're up, but we should have lunch after.&quot;<br />
<br />
The idea doesn't sound like a bad one. It turns out to be slightly awkward, at first, because of their different dietary needs. Hawks doesn't actually realize Miruko is a vegan until they're trying to pick a restaurant. &quot;It's not something I chose,&quot; she explains, surprisingly patient about it. &quot;Meat and dairy make me sick. You're an obligate carnivore, right?&quot; The way she says it is so casual that it takes him a moment to process.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh. I can eat plants,&quot; he finally supplies. Whether he does is another question--he should probably eat vegetables a bit more often. Avoid scurvy, or whatever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so we'll try for somewhere that has vegan options but doesn't focus on that entirely.&quot; That proves to be kind of tricky, but through a combination of web searches and a review app they settle on a place.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you so shredded if you only eat salad,&quot; he hears himself say after they order, and she laughs so hard he's worried she'll fall out of her chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;They make vegan protein powder, you know. And I could ask why you weigh next to nothing when you mostly eat meat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that's the bones.&quot; She looks at him blankly. &quot;Birds have hollow bones? I do, too, or else I'd be too heavy to fly. All my feathers combined are heavier than my skeleton.&quot; Her expression has turned vaguely horrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck,&quot; she says, and he shrugs.<br />
<br />
&quot;They'd make pretty bad weapons if they didn't have some heft to them,&quot; he says easily. This does not make her relax. &quot;Also, I have a lot of feathers,&quot; he says, fanning his wings out about halfway in demonstration. He folds them up again quickly so he won't block anyone from walking by or pulling out their chairs. She rolls her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I noticed. Grooming all that must be a nightmare,&quot; she says, and he shrugs.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is, I guess, but I wouldn't be able to fly very well if I didn't maintain them. And I love flying.&quot; She smiles at him, and it's softer than he's seen from her before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you take me flying sometime?&quot; she asks, and he raises his eyebrows. She absolutely strikes him as the adrenaline junkie type who would enjoy it, but most people are more restrained about asking. &quot;I've always wondered what it's like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, of course,&quot; he says, and she outright beams. &quot;Everyone should try it at least once. And hey, maybe we could make a move out of it. I drop you in and you kick the poor sucker into next week.&quot; She laughs again and slaps him on the arm in a bro-y kind of way, which actually really hurts. Yikes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought you didn't like team-ups,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought you didn't, either,&quot; he counters.<br />
<br />
They stare at each other for a moment before breaking into near-identical grins. &quot;I think it has potential.&quot;<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
When Hawks wanders into League headquarters he finds Dabi and Spinner sitting on the couch. No one else seems to be around. He walks over to join them, only to find Spinner curled up half on top of Dabi, pressed against him shoulder to knee. Dabi looks resigned to his fate. Spinner looks up at Hawks like he's daring him to make a comment. &quot;He may be a jerk, but he's warm,&quot; he says, and Hawks lets out a surprised laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;That so? You know, I get cold, too. Maybe I should join.&quot; Spinner's expression loses the sharp edge. Dabi rolls his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just like me for my body,&quot; he drawls as Hawks settles in against his other side. He is warm, just the right temperature to make the muscles in Hawks' back loosen. His wings flex a few times absentmindedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That a problem?&quot; Hawks teases, leaning his head on Dabi's shoulder. Dabi, for some reason, allows it.<br />
<br />
Spinner laughs. &quot;Damn, reduced to just a heating lamp booty call,&quot; he quips. &quot;That's a downgrade from a regular booty call.&quot; Dabi flips him off. Hawks wonders briefly if the League actually thinks there's something between them or if that was just a joke. He decides it doesn't matter; at worst it won't change anything, and at best they'll trust him more for being close to Dabi. (Not that he thinks they're particularly close, but whatever.)<br />
<br />
Toga waltzes in from the other room, spotting them and making a beeline for the couch. &quot;Cuddle pile! Why wasn't I invited?&quot; she asks. She's mostly looking at Dabi, who gives her a pained look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely not. This is not a fucking cuddle pile and no one is joining.&quot; Toga looks at Spinner and Hawks again skeptically. She then proceeds to sprawl across all their laps like a spoiled cat. Her face is suddenly very close to Hawks, who does his best not to jerk back in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you're really handsome up close! And you look good in red,&quot; she says, her eyes lingering over his wings in a way that makes him feel like she's going to rip them off. &quot;Bet you'd look good in even more red.&quot; Her voice has gone low and dangerous, and she may be a tiny teenage girl, but Hawks feels like he's about to be pounced on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oi, you can't eat our pet bird,&quot; Dabi says, and then proceeds to swat her on the ass like she's a misbehaving child. She squirms in protest and Dabi takes the opportunity to dump her onto the floor. She whines a bit and then sits up, facing them like nothing happened. Hawks watches with absolute fascination.<br />
<br />
Whether because this is a common occurrence or because he has other things on his mind, Spinner completely ignores the spectacle. &quot;Don't call him a pet. Do you have any idea how offensive that is?&quot; Hawks is oddly touched. Spinner normally avoids him, and he's not sure if it's clashing animal instincts or clashing personalities. Bit of both, maybe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, it's okay, I've heard worse,&quot; Hawks says, waving it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet.&quot; Whatever response he was expecting, it wasn't that. He leans around Dabi to stare at Spinner. &quot;You're the number two hero, yeah? Seems like a job where you encounter a lot of people.&quot; Hawks nods, bewildered. &quot;And how much anti-mutant bullshit did you encounter on the way?&quot;<br />
<br />
It takes him a moment to process this. He's a bit ashamed of himself for disregarding Spinner up to this point. He seems like a born follower, but he's surprisingly passionate about this. Granted, that's because it affects him directly, but Hawks doesn't see a problem with that. Lots of people only care about things that affect them directly. &quot;It's been growing lately. Don't know why,&quot; he muses. &quot;Could be that since me and Miruko are both in the top ten, heteromorphic quirks are really visible right now? 'Course, we both have the 'right' kind of mutations, right? Human faces.&quot; There's respect in Spinner's eyes, suddenly. Probably because it's coming out too easily for it to be entirely for Spinner's approval. &quot;Gang Orca gets so much shit. He should be ranked higher.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gang Orca is a badass,&quot; Spinner agrees easily. Hawks is surprised to hear anything positive about a hero in League headquarters.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a real softie, too. Gives me advice from time to time, since we both have predatory animal quirks.&quot; Toga lets out a little 'aww' sound. &quot;There are some things he just understands better than other people, you know?&quot; Spinner nods thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't spend much time around anyone but my family, before. Reptile quirks are kind of rare, and with my face...&quot; Spinner says. Hawks nods sympathetically.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're lucky you don't have a tail,&quot; he says, and Spinner looks confused. &quot;People get grabby.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spinner's expression darkens again, but interestingly enough, it's Dabi who speaks. &quot;That's fucked up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks shrugs. &quot;Part of the job,&quot; he says blandly, stretching out a wing and fanning out the feathers. They all look at it. &quot;Eye-catching, right? So it's understandable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's no excuse,&quot; Dabi says, surprisingly vehement. &quot;People shouldn't touch you without your permission. And you should be able to say no.&quot; Yikes. Hawks didn't even say anything about that aspect of it, but of course Dabi picked up on it. He's uncomfortably sharp. Maybe he's noticed the way Hawks never pushes people off when they touch him out of nowhere, even when he reasonably could. Wouldn't be good to build that up into a habit, not when he's so popular with the public.<br />
<br />
Toga is nodding, her expression serious and a little sad. &quot;Did you not like me touching you before? I'm sorry! I'll say something first next time,&quot; she says solemnly.<br />
<br />
Hawks' wing curls back in defensively and he waves his hands around. This conversation has really gone sideways. &quot;No, no, no. That's not necessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it fuckin' is,&quot; Dabi insists, and Hawks shoves a wing into his face in his desperation to make him shut up. Quite a few feathers end up in Dabi's mouth. His primaries hit Spinner in the face, too, but he just laughs. Dabi's hands start visibly smoking. Hawks takes his wing back, fighting the urge to hide his face behind his coat collar.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys aren't strangers, so it's fine,&quot; he says grudgingly. The thing is, he means it. The League is strangely comfortable to be around. More comfortable than they should be, probably.<br />
<br />
Toga coos. &quot;Aww, Hawks! That's so sweet!&quot; She shifts so she's kneeling in front of him, resting her arms on his knees and laying her head on them. For lack of knowing what else to do, he reaches out to pat her head. She looks thrilled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not touching him lasted a long time, I see,&quot; Dabi drawls, and Toga sticks her tongue out at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;He said it was fine, right?&quot; She turns back to Hawks, who nods. Apparently satisfied, she rests her head against his knees again. It's actually pretty cute. Since she seems to like it he keeps petting her hair absentmindedly. &quot;And you're touching him,&quot; she points out, sounding smug.<br />
<br />
Hawks is indeed sitting close to Dabi, just shy of snuggling, their hips and shoulders pressed close. He watches with interest as the healthy parts of Dabi's cheeks go pink. &quot;He asked me to, you little-- And Spinner is always using me as a space heater, it's the same thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm cold-blooded, asshole,&quot; Spinner adds without any real bite. &quot;It's not a choice.&quot; It sounds like an argument they've had hundreds of times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why you're not cinders by now for clinging to me,&quot; Dabi says easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not cold-blooded,&quot; Hawks says, and he's not entirely sure why he's explaining this to them. &quot;Bird metabolism doesn't mesh well with not being completely covered in feathers. I get really cold if I'm not moving.&quot; Spinner nods in understanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes I just fall asleep if I don't move for a while,&quot; Spinner says, and Hawks nods vehemently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too! My sidekicks give me shit for falling asleep on my paperwork all the time, but sitting makes me sleepy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure you don't just hate paperwork, Birdie?&quot; Dabi teases. Hawks makes a face at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't actually have eyelids,&quot; Spinner announces, apropos of nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have three,&quot; Hawks admits, flicking his nictitating membrane over his eyes in demonstration. &quot;Useful for flying.&quot; The other three process this for a moment. Then Spinner holds up his hand, and Hawks looks at the textured pads on his fingertips with fascination. He's aware of Spinner's quirk, of course, but he's never seen the mechanism that makes it possible up close before. Wordlessly he takes off a glove and shows him his talons. They flex a little upon exposure to the air, and Spinner's eyes are wide. Then again, that could be the lack of eyelids.<br />
<br />
&quot;Built-in knives,&quot; Toga says reverently, taking his hand in both of hers and poking at them gently. He has to wrestle down the raptor instinct to grab so he won't claw the hell out of her. His talons flex again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy,&quot; Dabi says, sounding amused. &quot;He's going to take your arm off if you do that.&quot; As if to prove his point Hawks' talons curl in a bit reflexively as Toga nudges at one fingertip.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will not,&quot; Hawks grits out, carefully pulling his hand out of Toga's grip. She looks disappointed, watching as he puts his glove back on. &quot;But it's probably better for the gloves to stay on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they're so pretty,&quot; Toga whines. Hawks feels his eyes widen in surprise. 'Pretty' is not the adjective that comes to mind for most people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thanks. Don't want to hurt you, though,&quot; he says with an embarrassed chuckle. Dabi snorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'd be her own fault.&quot; He does not sound concerned about the idea of Hawks mangling his teammate in the least. Hawks' chest feels oddly warm over it. He's spending too much time with villains. &quot;We just talked about this. You ever had a cat, Toga? Grab a predator with no warning and you're gonna have a bad fuckin' time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks frowns, shifting a little against Dabi's side in discomfort over the description. He's not a wild animal, he can control himself, he's been trained to control himself--<br />
<br />
Dabi turns to look at him seriously, and there's a beat of silence before he breaks into a wide, dangerous grin. &quot;You're a villain now, Birdie. You can defend yourself from wandering hands however you want. No one's gonna complain, not even Toga. Not even if you do take her arm off with your pretty claws.&quot; He turns to Toga as if for confirmation, and she's pouting but doesn't argue. Hawks' wings flutter in surprise and maybe a touch of pleasure. He's definitely spending too much time with villains.<br />
<br />
&quot;I. That's. Kind of you,&quot; Hawks stammers, and Dabi throws his head back and laughs. Hawks cuffs him in the back of the head with his wing. &quot;Still going to do my best not to cause severe blood loss, though,&quot; he adds dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you actually take my arm off? All the way off, I mean,&quot; Toga wonders, also looking unconcerned by the possibility. Not like Hawks didn't know there was something wrong with these people, but there's really something wrong with these people.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've never tried,&quot; he says with no small amount of alarm. If they ask for a demonstration, he's out. &quot;I don't use them in combat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't?! But they'd be so convenient.&quot; Toga sounds downright scandalized that he's not going around mauling his enemies. Somehow Hawks thinks that would affect his popularity. &quot;You'd never have to carry a knife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean,&quot; Hawks says, stretching out his wing and sharpening all his feathers at once. Toga squeals in delight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God,&quot; she says dreamily. &quot;You're basically made of knives. I think I'm in love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks makes a face. &quot;I'm flattered, but you're, like, five,&quot; he says, and Dabi and Spinner both start laughing. Toga pouts and opens her mouth to say something. &quot;The answer is still 'no' when you're older,&quot; he adds. She shuts her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're no fun,&quot; Toga whines.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were in love with me,&quot; Hawks deadpans. Spinner is now laughing so hard he falls over into Dabi's lap, and Dabi lets him stay there because he's laughing too hard to shove him off. Toga makes an 'ugh' noise and flops down onto the floor dramatically. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he says, voice still dry. &quot;You're not the first sixteen-year-old girl to confess to me out of nowhere, and I doubt you'll be the last.&quot; There's a despairing noise from the floor. &quot;Dodging it is basically my second job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought we were your second job,&quot; Dabi says, managing to calm down enough to push Spinner upright again. He's surprisingly gentle about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, you're my third. Or fourth?&quot; he muses, looking up at the ceiling as he thinks about it. &quot;I also model.&quot; He grins at Dabi, who looks unamused. Right, he disapproves of all the publicity stuff. It would look seriously weird if Hawks just stopped that out of nowhere, though, and his popularity helps the League.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, that's right! That one that came out last month was so good,&quot; Toga says, her tone close to gushing. The excitement over things that aren't blood or knives, for once, makes her seem more like her own age. &quot;I think I still have it! I'll be right back.&quot; The rest of them watch, nonplussed, as she runs off. When she comes back it's with a magazine he recognizes immediately, and it makes him groan and cover his face with his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't tell me you want me to sign that,&quot; he says, despairing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Of course I do! You're the only celebrity I know!&quot; Hawks drags his hands down his face, just in time to see Toga open to the right page and reveal way more of his body than he had initially agreed to show in that shoot. Dabi whistles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, Birdie, I didn't know you did porn,&quot; he says gleefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to formally request that one of you kill me immediately,&quot; Hawks says, flat, and Dabi cackles.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be a waste of a great ass.&quot; Hawks groans again and leans his head back against the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have signed so many copies of that stupid magazine since it came out,&quot; he tells the ceiling. &quot;And getting asked to sign people's asses is expected, at this point, but I usually don't get asked to sign my own.&quot; Toga grins at him and he makes a face. &quot;Please don't make me sign my own ass again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; she says, looking at the pictures critically. &quot;Your abs are pretty nice, too. How about those?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marginally better,&quot; he says dully. &quot;I'll take it.&quot; She produces a pen from somewhere and he signs his stomach for her--God--personalizing it 'to Himiko' because why not really go for it? When she gets it back she squeals in excitement, so apparently that was the right choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm keeping this forever,&quot; she says reverently, looking starry-eyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yikes,&quot; Hawks says, and Dabi chortles again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess we know now why all those teenage girls are confessing to you,&quot; he says, and Hawks gets the feeling he's going to be getting teased over this for as long as they know each other. As if Dabi wasn't annoying enough already.<br />
<br />
&quot;This one was much more popular with men,&quot; he says before he can think to filter himself. When he realizes what he just said he pinches the bridge of his nose.<br />
<br />
Dabi very deliberately looks at the ass picture and then back at Hawks. &quot;Understandable,&quot; he drawls. This fucker. Hawks is getting ready to retort when he catches sight of Spinner out of the corner of his eye. Unlike the other two he's been weirdly quiet, and he seems like he's trying to avoid looking at the pictures as much as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Toga, you're making Spinner uncomfortable with my nudity,&quot; he says. There's an awkward moment where he and Spinner stare at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do they usually fetishize you like that?&quot; Spinner finally asks. He sounds surprisingly distressed about it. Dabi and Toga abruptly go quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do people keep saying that?&quot; Hawks asks, feeling tired. &quot;Miruko said the same thing, but this stuff is just...&quot; He waves a hand around vaguely. &quot;Normal? I mean, it's embarrassing, but it's just. The way it is. Has been since I debuted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you're not listening, I guess,&quot; Spinner says with a frown. &quot;You said earlier that you have the 'right' kind of mutation. What exactly did you mean by that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks blinks, unsure where he's trying to go with this. &quot;Just what I said. I have a human face, mostly. So people think of me as an exception to the rule. With the rule being 'mutants suck,' I guess.&quot; Spinner looks like he's expecting more than this, but Hawks is at a loss.<br />
<br />
&quot;The same people who think I'm ugly think you're pretty,&quot; Spinner says simply. &quot;Even though you're a mutant and they hate mutants, you're okay because you have a 'sexy' mutation. And so they objectify you. Fixate on your wings. That's what I mean by fetishizing.&quot; Hawks stares at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; he says slowly, still feeling like he missed something somewhere. &quot;And that connects to the ass pictures because...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was a whole lot of focus on your wings.&quot; Hawks frowns, wondering how this somehow bothers everyone but him.<br />
<br />
&quot;My wingspan is more than twice my height. It's hard not to focus on them.&quot; Spinner does not look impressed by this argument.<br />
<br />
&quot;So they have to use them as a built-in frame slash censor bar for your naked body?&quot; Okay, point taken. Hawks can't think of a retort. &quot;Do I want to know how many times you've gotten angel comparisons?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks grimaces. &quot;Probably not, no,&quot; he admits reluctantly. &quot;That's not--it's cringey, and awkward, and seriously inaccurate, but it's not fetishizing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He doesn't say how many of his past dates and hookups have been uncomfortably obsessed with his wings, enough that he didn't call back. How many times photographers have insisted on making his wings the focus of a picture. How many times he's wished he could just take them off--without completely disarming himself--so people would stop looking and touching and commenting.<br />
<br />
He doesn't say that he's protesting so hard because having someone else recognize it before he did is embarrassing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Spinner says in a way that says he definitely doesn't agree.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
When he wakes up in the morning Dabi is in his kitchen, watching over something on the stove, and he looks away and then back again to check whether he's a hallucination. &quot;Am I drunk?&quot; he asks when Dabi doesn't disappear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't know,&quot; Dabi says easily, pushing what looks like eggs around in a pan. Hawks stares.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing in my kitchen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cooking, birdbrain.&quot; Hawks opens his mouth. Closes it. Considers the very real possibility that he has been drugged in some way. Opens his mouth again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Why are you cooking in my kitchen? 'My kitchen' being the important part of that question.&quot; Dabi huffs a laugh, sliding the eggs out of the pan onto a plate and then pushing the plate into Hawks' hands. There is no plate for Dabi. Did he just break into Hawks' apartment solely to make him eggs? This makes the eggs orders of magnitude more suspicious. He squints at them. &quot;Did you poison these,&quot; he wonders aloud.<br />
<br />
Dabi makes an offended noise in the back of his throat. &quot;Why would I poison your apology eggs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apology eggs,&quot; Hawks repeats slowly.<br />
<br />
Dabi grimaces. &quot;Spinner...impressed on me that I was insensitive yesterday.&quot; The way he says 'impressed' makes Hawks think Spinner threatened to stab him. &quot;That maybe you weren't as comfortable with those pictures as you were acting. And I wanted to apologize. So, eggs,&quot; he finishes, as though this actually makes sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay,&quot; Hawks says. Dabi relaxes a bit. &quot;I've been drugged. I've been drugged and possibly kidnapped and this is an elaborate hallucination.&quot; Dabi pulls a face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Startin' to get offended here, pigeon,&quot; he says, and he actually does look a little bit offended. Hawks shrugs, taking a bite of the eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have never been nice to me about anything,&quot; he says simply. &quot;So pardon me if I don't buy it. Decent eggs, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dabi looks pained. &quot;I also thought I might have. Crossed a line. With some of the-- I wasn't tryin' to harass you.&quot; Hawks chokes on his eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harass me-- Okay, first, don't remind me of that conversation, I had nearly blocked it out. Second, that was not harassment, that was you being a little shit, as usual. And/or hitting on me, but whatever. I am the king of gay chicken, you don't intimidate me.&quot; Dabi lets out a strange, wheezy sort of laugh. &quot;Third, stop trying to be nice. It's weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you even tell me if you were offended?&quot; Dabi asks.<br />
<br />
Hawks takes a moment to think about that. &quot;Hmm. Probably not, nope.&quot; Dabi looks resigned to this. &quot;How'd you get in here, anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The lock on your balcony door is fucked,&quot; Dabi says breezily. Hawks side-eyes him as he washes his now-empty plate. &quot;Seems like a security risk for someone so high-profile. Might want to get it fixed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the eggs. If you did poison them after all I'm definitely haunting you,&quot; Hawks promises. Dabi laughs the wheezy laugh again.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Hawks is in the League kitchen at three in the morning eating raw chicken when Toga comes in unexpectedly. &quot;This isn't what it looks like,&quot; he says, and then immediately wonders what the hell he thinks he can pass this off as. What's that disease called where people eat dirt, again?<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like you're having a late-night snack,&quot; Toga says, unconcerned. She digs in the fridge and pulls out a pouch of what looks to be blood, sticking a straw into it like a fucking juice box and taking a big gulp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh. It is what it looks like, then,&quot; he says, all resistance to her knowing about his meat cravings draining out of him. &quot;Is that blood?&quot; She nods and holds out the straw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want some?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, thank you,&quot; he manages, politely. He considers asking whether it's animal blood or human before deciding firmly that it's better he doesn't know.<br />
<br />
Spinner chooses that moment to come into the kitchen. Hawks, who still has his hand in a container of raw chicken, stares at him. Spinner looks them both over before crossing to a cabinet and getting a container of something out. Hawks is still staring. Spinner opens the container to reveal it's full of dead crickets. Hawks blinks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the weird snack club,&quot; Spinner says easily, popping a cricket into his mouth. &quot;No judgment.&quot; It sounds like both a promise and a warning, but Hawks can't bring himself to mind. No one has ever seen him eat raw meat without being utterly disgusted, and now there are two people who have reacted like it's no big deal within the space of five minutes. It's a little bit overwhelming. He tentatively brings another piece of chicken to his mouth, and neither of the others bat an eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is. You. Where do you get the blood?&quot; Hawks finally asks, morbidly curious. It looks professionally packaged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! There are all kinds of businesses that cater to unusual quirks out there, if you know where to look,&quot; Toga says easily. &quot;The place I get these from also cooks it into all kinds of things for people who need it but don't like the taste like this. I love the sausages!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's great,&quot; Hawks says, and finds he means it. All things considered, his quirk is pretty easy to accommodate. Tailors catering to body mutations are everywhere. He can get meat from any grocery store. Extra blankets and coats and a slightly higher-than-normal heating bill keep him warm. He can't imagine what it would be like to crave blood from a young age.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I get desperate I can hunt down birds and squirrels and stuff, but this is more convenient.&quot; She pauses, frowning down at the blood pouch. &quot;Not as fun, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes I see squirrels or mice and my raptor brain wants me to catch them,&quot; Hawks admits, because it's three in the morning and it's dark and apparently he has no filter anymore. &quot;I don't do it. And I don't know if I would eat them, but.&quot; Toga just nods sympathetically.<br />
<br />
&quot;I totally get it,&quot; she says. &quot;I always want to eat birds, even when I'm not hungry.&quot; Hawks raises his eyebrows, his wings folding tighter against his back on instinct. &quot;Oh, not you! Even if you do look delicious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hawks makes a face at her. &quot;You're so cute I forget how much of a nightmare you are sometimes,&quot; he says. Spinner cackles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; She beams at him, and there's blood on her teeth. Hawks isn't sure if she's thanking him for saying she's cute or calling her a nightmare.<br />
<br />
Dabi comes in at that moment, walking right through the middle of their group to get to the glasses and the sink without batting an eye. Hawks freezes, not fond of the idea of yet another person knowing about his eating habits. &quot;You've gained a member,&quot; Dabi observes, sounding amazingly calm about it. Spinner holds his cricket container up like he's proposing a toast. &quot;Should have figured. You're always eating,&quot; he says to Hawks, who is still frozen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bird metabolism,&quot; Hawks manages somehow. &quot;Flying is resource-intensive. And today was busy.&quot; Dabi takes a sip of his water and nods. &quot;This seriously doesn't bother any of you?&quot; he finally asks the room at large. He waves the chicken a little for emphasis.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am literally eating bugs right now,&quot; Spinner says, popping another one into his mouth, as if in demonstration. Toga nods and waves her now-empty blood pouch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't give a fuck as long as you don't contaminate the other stuff in the fridge,&quot; Dabi says with a shrug. &quot;We're not all immune to salmonella.&quot; He crosses to the fridge and digs around in it for a moment before straightening up, glaring at Toga. She shrinks a little. &quot;Just like we're all going to die of some blood-borne disease because someone keeps leaving her blood pouches on top of the other food,&quot; he says, his voice low and dangerous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Dad!&quot; Toga says, and they all freeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you call me,&quot; Dabi says, taking a step toward her. He sounds kind of choked. Spinner climbs onto the cabinets to get away from them both, sticking there with his feet and one hand and using the other hand to hold his crickets. He pulls them right out of the container with his tongue. Hawks barely sees this out of the corner of his eye because he's riveted to Toga. She's holding the empty blood pouch in front of her like it can shield her from impending doom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dabi! I meant Dabi!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dabi stops advancing and takes a deep breath. Lets it out. &quot;Fix it,&quot; he says, and Toga nods vigorously, hurrying over to the fridge. &quot;And then go to bed, young lady.&quot; Spinner laughs, hard, and then promptly chokes on a cricket.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
The next day the tabloids explode with pictures of him and Miruko at their lunch. He has to admit that they got some good shots: the two of them laughing over something, her grinning and reaching out to touch his arm, him telling her some story and gesturing wildly while she listens with rapt attention. Unfortunately, the fact that these things were caught on camera means they're dating, according to every single outlet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hawks,&quot; Toga whines at him when he comes into League headquarters that afternoon. &quot;W</td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">Peter isn't about to blame himself the first time it happens, but he will admit he should've known better than to fall asleep with the window open.<br />
<br />
To his credit, he was dead on his feet by the time he arrived back at his apartment, unable to do much more than strip off the suit, hastily brush his teeth, and drop onto his bed. He didn't even bother to get under the covers. He considers it something of a minor miracle that he made it to his bed rather than passing out on the sofa. Balancing college with work would be hard enough on its own, he knows that well enough from his peers, but juggling both of those commitments on top of protecting the city in a mask every night as well really takes it out of a guy.<br />
<br />
So he didn't think to check the window before he succumbed to sleep. It's irresponsible, something he tries very hard not to be anymore, but it happens.<br />
<br />
It's still night when he jerks awake, all systems on alert and heart rate already increased. He lies silently in the dark before rushing up to do anything foolish, and peers at the clock on the nightstand. It's just after 4am, which means he only slept for about two hours, and he sighs. He really hoped he could stick through until his 8am alarm, but it doesn't look like he'll have that luxury tonight. There's a lengthy moment when he's convinced he's still just running on overdrive from the night's patrol and he actually shuts his eyes again for a second before he hears it.<br />
<br />
The apartment isn't anything special, and Peter certainly hasn't gone to much effort to make it so. It's old, too, and there's that one creaky floorboard by the table that annoys him every time he steps on it. Right now though, as his ears pick up on the unmistakable sound of someone treading on it, he's grateful.<br />
<br />
He pushes himself up and stands as quietly as he can, and that's when he notices the light and not exactly unpleasant breeze in his room. He glares at the open window as though it's to blame, and then remembers he fell asleep on top of the covers in just his underwear. He doesn't curse himself aloud, but it's a close call.<br />
<br />
So there's somebody in his apartment, they let themselves in through his bedroom window, and they passed right by him, asleep and vulnerable and almost naked, on the bed. He makes the executive decision that he's not in any immediate danger, and takes a second to pull on a shirt and his mask before he leaves the room. It's probably too late to be called a precaution, but he doesn't know for sure that the intruder saw his face, so he'll take whatever defence he can get.<br />
<br />
Whoever it is hasn't turned a light on. There's a bulky shape in the kitchen area, not really doing anything, just standing by the table. Peter supposes they haven't moved since the floorboard creaked. That leaves him alone in the dark with a potentially dangerous stranger, both of them on edge and waiting for something to happen.<br />
<br />
Well, he's not about to stand around waiting be taken by surprise again, so he makes the first move, and flicks the light on.<br />
<br />
The figure moves quickly, but Peter's faster. He doesn't try to fight yet, just takes to the wall and gets away from the dark red shape rushing towards him. He's still adjusting to the sudden brightness, so dark red is really the only thing he takes from this initial encounter, but as he holds himself up in the opposite corner of the room, head just brushing the ceiling, blinking and watching the scene before him start to come together, it's enough.<br />
<br />
'Deadpool?'<br />
<br />
There's another moment of silence during which Peter watches as Deadpool's fingers flex around the hilt of one of his katanas, not yet unsheathed, before he lets go and drops his hand to wave up at Peter instead.<br />
<br />
'Morning sunshine!' <br />
<br />
Peter scowls behind the mask. 'It's the middle of the night!'<br />
<br />
'Bullshit! It's the am, so it counts as morning. Believe it or not, I was planning on waking you up, but you looked so cute and peaceful fast asleep that I figured I'd just leave you instead. Would it'd have been better if I woke you?'<br />
<br />
'Obviously,' Peter snaps, then huffs. 'It'd be better if you hadn't broken into my apartment at 4am to start with.'<br />
<br />
'Hey, don't be like that, I didn't break anything, there was no breaking involved.' Deadpool pauses and laughs. 'Not right now, anyway.'<br />
<br />
Peter inches down the wall slightly. 'What does that mean?'<br />
<br />
Deadpool lifts his other hand. Or rather, he lifts his arm, and his hand dangles loosely from a broken wrist. 'Give me some credit, Spidey, you really think I'd show up here unannounced and uninvited without good reason?'<br />
<br />
'Yes,' Peter interrupts, without hesitation. He's trying not to look at the lifeless hand Deadpool's still flapping at him. It's too late - or early - for this. Deadpool just continues like Peter hadn't spoken at all. <br />
<br />
'I just needed somewhere to rest up a while, lay low while my bones fit themselves back together, because it ain't exactly a pleasant process and it ain't exactly fun hiding behind a dumpster in a back alley while everything snaps itself into place, you know?'<br />
<br />
'No.'<br />
<br />
'So I thought to myself, me and Spidey are friends just about as much as I'm friends with anyone, he wouldn't want me to suffer outside alone in the cold, I'll pay him a quick visit and ask if I can crash at his place for an hour, two hours tops. Except then you were fast asleep, but by the time I got here it was starting to really fucking ache, 'cause broken wrists are never fun, ever, and I figured it was worth the risk. I really didn't mean to wake you, but also, it's boring as shit waiting there in the dark for your bones to fix themselves so I'm kind of glad you're up and at 'em now.' Deadpool pauses, cocking his head as he looks up at Peter, but only for a second. 'But maybe you don't need to be that up up, huh? You gonna come down?'<br />
<br />
'You gonna stab and-or shoot me?'<br />
<br />
'Not if you don't give me a reason to.' Deadpool's voice is cheery, but there's a thin layer of steel beneath it. Sometimes it can be easy to forget he's a trained and paid killer. Other times, Peter's all too quickly reminded. He inches the rest of the way down the wall and leans back against it, folding his arms and frowning under his mask. <br />
<br />
'How do you know where I live?' <br />
<br />
Deadpool shrugs, seeming to pay more attention to his limp hand than Peter now they're back on equal ground. He flicks it and watches as it swings back and forth like it's held on by a string. Peter clamps down on the urge to storm over and grab Deadpool's good hand just to keep him from playing with the damn thing. Way too late - or early - for this.<br />
<br />
'Followed you home one night.'<br />
<br />
'You what?'<br />
<br />
'It wasn't as seedy as it sounds, promise. Pretty much the same reason as tonight, because this whole trying not kill people thing is ruining me, Spidey. I'm sure I never used to get this hurt when I just cut people in half or blew their brains out without thinking, but nowadays making the effort to do the right thing really takes it out of a guy. And I always just think if one person can both A) understand that and B) put up with me for a short amount of time, it's you. So I followed you home one night trying to hold my guts in and I got all the way up to your window and I wasn't just gonna barge in, I was gonna ask if you could just spare me a bandage or something, but... You were busy, anyway, didn't want to interrupt you and your pretty redhead friend. Point is, it wasn't pointless stalking, you know?'<br />
<br />
Peter blinks. It's quite a bit to take in at once, but when is talking to Deadpool ever not an exercise in cognitive processing? The merc with a mouth goes a mile a minute. He stores that line away to pull out at a later date, because he has a feeling Deadpool would like all that unnecessary alliteration if he's in a good enough mood.<br />
<br />
'Wait, so... Where did you end up healing?'<br />
<br />
Deadpool looks at Peter, or so Peter assumes, because the mask is once again turned towards him. 'Just laid down on your fire escape and waited. Stitched myself back together in the end, just like always. Even wiped up the blood after, not that there was much to start with, because I was trying to not be too much of an asshole and leave a mess everywhere.'<br />
<br />
'So you know where Spider Man lives, but not, um. Me?'<br />
<br />
He thinks he can even see Deadpool rolling his eyes behind the mask. It's a lot more expressive than Peter's. 'Your secret identity remains a secret, bug boy. Spending an hour camping out stargazing on someone's fire escape doesn't reveal your innermost hidden truths. And because it's probably stressing you out, you were flat out face down on the bed when I got here, all smushed into the pillow so bad I wondered for a second if you'd been smothered, except then you snored, but not really a proper snore, like a little snuffle, which was adorable by the way, so I knew you were alive, and I didn't see your face, no, just all that...' Deadpool waves his good hand vaguely around his head.<br />
<br />
'Hair?' Peter supplies, trying not to smirk. He needn't have bothered, Deadpool barks a low laugh.<br />
<br />
'Exactly, except I was thinking more of the word, uh, mane. Still, when you look like me, anyone with hair looks like they've got a whole mass of it.'<br />
<br />
Peter nods, hoping it comes off as sincere understanding rather than polite agreement. He hasn't seen Deadpool's face, but given that the first time they met Deadpool had told Peter his full name and practically provided him with directions to his apartment (at the time), he knows there's a particular reason that goes beyond the secret identity shtick most other masked heroes are concerned with. <br />
<br />
His brief nod doesn't seem to cause any offence, at least, as Deadpool just continues. 'So, I can hole up here, right? Look at me.' He flaps his hand again. 'You wouldn't send me out into the cold like this, would you?'<br />
<br />
Peter sighs and gestures carelessly to the couch. Deadpool practically bounces over to it and sits down heavily. The old frame creaks under his bulk. Peter fidgets awkwardly where he stands. He thinks Deadpool notices, or maybe it's just his nature - never let a silence drag.<br />
<br />
'So what are we thinking, Spider kid, slumber party? Pizza and a movie? Paint each other's nails? Ooh, maybe even a pillow fight. Should I get naked?'<br />
<br />
'Please don't,' Peter replies automatically, but his voice is light. He wants to offend Deadpool right now about as much as he wants one of those katanas through his belly.<br />
<br />
Deadpool laughs, and his tone holds a hint of self-deprecation amongst the humour. 'Don't you worry your fluffy little head, I won't subject you to that.' He stretches out on the couch. The full span of his arms, fingertip to fingertip, take up the entire length of the back cushion. 'So I guess that rules out the pillow fight, I'm pretty sure you have to be buck ass naked for that.'<br />
<br />
'You watch too many teen movies.' It's surprisingly easy to banter with Deadpool when he's not trying to stop him from killing people on the street. Although to Deadpool's credit, he wasn't exactly lying when he mentioned his attempts to be less lethal when taking on opponents - Peter doesn't think of Deadpool's enemies as bad guys, because he's not entirely sure Deadpool himself is a good guy. But for the time being, he's at least making an effort. It's about the only reason Peter hasn't returned to the arduous task of kicking him out the city.<br />
<br />
'So I take it that's a no to the nail painting too? That's a real shame, 'cause your pretty hands would look even prettier with a manicure, Spidey.'<br />
<br />
Peter's glad he thought to put his mask on, because he really hates it when Deadpool makes him blush.<br />
<br />
'Which I guess just leaves us with the pizza and a movie option, which I know ain't exactly special, but I've got no problems with it if you do,' Deadpool continues, thankfully oblivious to Peter's flushing cheeks. It almost sounds tempting, and Peter almost says yes, but he's still got that whole responsibility thing going on.<br />
<br />
'That doesn't sound like a bad idea,' he starts, and Deadpool goes still. Peter laughs. 'Yeah, I know, I'm as surprised as you are. But as much as I'd love to watch you stuff your mouth full of your topping of choice-'<br />
<br />
'Pineapple and olive,' Deadpool interrupts.<br />
<br />
'-If only to shut you up for a little while, I'm gonna have to pass. It's 4am Deadpool, we've been over this. If I don't get at least another few hours in I'm gonna have to skip my morning patrol before class. Also, pineapple and olive? Really? What kind of sick animal are you?'<br />
<br />
'It's the fucking best,' Deadpool says, voice a growl without any edge to it, all bark and no bite. 'And you're a fucking bore.'<br />
<br />
'You can have the couch,' Peter says, heading back towards his bedroom. He snaps his fingers and points at Deadpool in what he hopes is a threatening gesture. 'Don't come in my room unless you're leaving through the window before I wake up, and if you do, shut it behind you.'<br />
<br />
'Should've known you'd be a stickler for rules, kid,' Deadpool says, before waving him away - with the hand still dangling from his broken wrist, and Peter can't stop himself from shuddering. Deadpool stills again, and slowly lowers his hand, resting it limply on his thigh. Peter wants to apologise, but he's not sure he wants to draw any more attention to his display of disgust.<br />
<br />
'Um.' <br />
<br />
There's an awkwardness in the air again, just when Peter was starting to feel comfortable. He supposes it's probably a good thing; it could be dangerous to get comfortable around Deadpool.<br />
<br />
'Stop fretting, I'm not gonna do anything. Maybe have a nap once everything's all healed up and hurting less. I'll be out of your mane by morning, don't you worry.'<br />
<br />
'It's still hurting?' Peter asks, because he can't stop himself. Deadpool laughs.<br />
<br />
'Well, yeah. It's still broken and I keep on waving it around like a douchebag, 'course it still hurts. Go on, Spidey, go back to bed.'<br />
<br />
'Right,' Peter says. He fidgets awkwardly once more, then says a quick goodnight and does as Deadpool says, hearing a low 'night' behind him just before he shuts the bedroom door. <br />
<br />
He gets under the bedsheets this time, and he keeps his mask on, and then he lies in the dark and struggles to sleep and watches the thin line of light beneath his bedroom door. At seventeen minutes to 5, the light goes off. Peter falls asleep again not long after.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Deadpool's apartment has even less charm to it than Peter's. Although, Peter isn't entirely sure that it's even necessarily Deadpool's own home, because it's certainly not the same place Peter heard about the first time they met. It's in an entirely different neighbourhood. Peter adds it to the mental list of things he really needs to ask Deadpool about.<br />
<br />
He thinks it's only fair that he follows Deadpool home a week after their last interaction in Peter's apartment. He's not sure exactly why, but he doubts Deadpool will mind too much.<br />
<br />
Besides, Peter let Deadpool crash on his couch to heal. The least Deadpool can do is invite Peter in to clean up his own wounds - less severe than Deadpool's was, granted, but the cut on his shoulder is still stinging, and Peter doesn't heal the same.<br />
<br />
Deadpool leaves his window open behind him, but Peter can't say whether he does so on purpose or just out of carelessness. He supposes he doesn't really have much to be scared of from squatters or robbers.<br />
<br />
Not that there's much that robbers would come for, Peter notes as he looks through into Deadpool's living room. It's dingy and grimy, as though nobody has cleaned it in... a longer time than Peter really wants to think about. He knows he's messy, sure, but he's not dirty. This place is gross, and the only thing that looks like it might be worth anything is the television, but even that looks a few years old and in need of an upgrade. <br />
<br />
Peter drops in through the window almost silently, and straightens up just as Deadpool's halfway through taking off his mask, his back to the window. <br />
<br />
'If there's one thing I hate about weapons,' Peter says conversationally, leaning against the wall. He's looking around the room as he speaks, but he sees in his peripheral vision as Deadpool freezes in his unmasking and whirls around, pulling a gun from somewhere and aiming it at Peter's face. Peter didn't really expect anything else, considering he's the one sneaking about this time. So he continues casually, 'they can sometimes really hurt.'<br />
<br />
Deadpool relaxes with a sigh, lowering the hand holding the gun and using the other to adjust his mask, ensuring it's still in place. His face is still entirely covered; Peter only saw the back of Deadpool's head, and he didn't exactly get a good eyeful, but he's not sure he liked the glimpse he had. He makes an active - and probably wise - decision not to mention it. <br />
<br />
'Spidey,' Deadpool says, all cheer now he's lost most of his edge. 'Welcome to casa del DP, mi casa es tu casa and all that jazz. Gotta say, you took me by surprise there, you're lucky I didn't blow your precious genius brains all over that fucking wall.' It's light hearted banter, mostly, with a touch of dark, but Peter still has to fight not to step back. 'And it would've just broken my heart, wasting that mysterious face before I even really get to meet the man behind the mask.'<br />
<br />
'Alright, Deadpool, I think I get it. Thanks.'<br />
<br />
'No hay problema, bug boy. To what do I owe the pleasure?'<br />
<br />
'Well, you know, I was in the neighbourhood, thought I'd just... swing by.'<br />
<br />
Peter grins as Deadpool stares at him, his usually so expressive mask entirely passive as he slow claps. Peter shrugs like it was no big deal - which, really, it wasn't - and hisses when his suit drags across the cut in his shoulder. Oh, yeah. He'd totally forgotten all about that.<br />
<br />
People can say a lot of bad things about Deadpool, and Peter will frequently agree, but he will admit he can be a very welcome distraction.<br />
<br />
'Just dropped in for a chat, huh? No reasoning or ulterior motives whatsoever?' There's a smirk in Deadpool's voice.<br />
<br />
Peter sighs and takes a step forward. 'Alright, I followed you home from whatever mayhem and mischief you were causing tonight so you could... help me.'<br />
<br />
Deadpool stares for a moment, and then drops heavily onto the sofa in a perfect reenactment of a swoon. Peter folds his arms and rolls his eyes as Deadpool drapes his arm over his forehead.<br />
<br />
'Your place seemed closer and I needed someone to help patch me up. I'd have just gone home, usually, but it's kinda... not easy to reach my shoulder.'<br />
<br />
'What happened?' Deadpool asks, sitting up on the sofa, apparently suddenly very interested.<br />
<br />
'It was a quiet night, just a routine patrol, taking down a mugger...'<br />
<br />
<br />
'And?'<br />
<br />
<br />
'And I got stabbed, alright.'<br />
<br />
Deadpool sits up even straighter, one hand clenching in the stained cushion of the sofa, the other whipping a knife out from... somewhere, Peter honestly couldn't say for sure, which really isn't very comforting.<br />
<br />
'What are you doing?' he asks, because although he's fairly sure he knows Deadpool's intent, he's not sure why.<br />
<br />
Deadpool flicks his knife between his fingers a few times, watches Peter as Peter watches his hand, and then stabs the blade down into the cushion. Peter mostly manages to hide his flinch at the sheer viciousness in the action.<br />
<br />
'He get away?' Deadpool's usual teasing tone is gone, that undercurrent of steel brought right to the surface, low and threatening and cold and not at all even slightly hot. Not at all.<br />
<br />
'Yeah,' Peter mutters, and Deadpool pulls the knife out of the cushion, mindless of the stuffing that follows it, and pushes himself to his feet. Peter, in turn, pushes himself forward, and for a second he presses his palms to Deadpool's chest - was Deadpool always that much taller than him? - to hold him back. Deadpool stills and looks down at him, and Peter quickly steps away, fiddling with his gloves and pulling at the edges of his mask. 'What are you doing?' he repeats, even though he's definitely sure he knows the answer.<br />
<br />
'I'm gonna go after him, I thought that was pretty fucking obvious judging by the suit and the knife and the murderous intent.'<br />
<br />
'No, Deadpool. None of the murderous intent.' He sounds a lot like he's chastising a misbehaving dog, and he isn't proud of it.<br />
<br />
Deadpool mutters something that Peter decides to pretend he never heard, and crosses his arms. Peter also decides to ignore the way the red spandex stretches across Deadpool's arms when he does, at least for now. He'll think about it later, maybe. He has more pressing issues right now.<br />
<br />
'Listen, Wade,' he says, voice firm but less aggressive. 'I've got all the information I need about the guy, and I'll find him, and he'll be brought to justice, yadda yadda, you know the whole spiel. For now I need your help with the slightly more pressing issue of sewing up the open wound on my shoulder, because it's not fatal, but it isn't going to heal the same way your injuries do.'<br />
<br />
Deadpool has gone still and Peter hopes it's because he's listening and not because he's about to lose it - that it's genuine calm, rather than the calm before the storm.<br />
<br />
'How do you know my name?' he asks finally, and Peter blanches.<br />
<br />
'What? Everyone knows your name. You have a personal ad in the phone book. You told me your first, middle, and last name within ten minutes of meeting me, with three knives sticking out of your back.'<br />
<br />
'Huh. I guess I forgot, or, you know, figured I just never told you or you thought to look or you knew, at all, you've never called me Wade before.'<br />
<br />
'Never?' Peter asks, and he doesn't even need to finish the word before knowing it's true. Deadpool uncrosses his arms with a sigh and tosses the knife aside. Peter jumps at the sudden movement and stares at it where it wobbles slightly, half embedded in the wall.<br />
<br />
'So that's a no-no on the killing tonight then?'<br />
<br />
Peter cracks a half smile at that. 'You'd be a lot more helpful staying here and giving me a hand with this.' He tips his head towards his shoulder. 'Besides, I let you sleep on my sofa to heal last week. You kinda owe me one.'<br />
<br />
'I didn't even break anything.'<br />
<br />
'I know,' Peter says, sitting down on the sofa when Deadpool gestures. 'You'd owe me two if you had.'<br />
<br />
'You sure you don't mind me seeing you without the suit, Spidey? You're a pretty secretive guy.'<br />
<br />
'Just because you don't see the point in it doesn't mean we all want to be out in the open,' Peter replies. Deadpool shrugs like he doesn't care, but there's a bitterness in his voice when he speaks.<br />
<br />
'I get why, you know, that you've got people to protect who'd be in danger if people found out who you are. Makes sense. But when nobody cares about you, there's nobody to protect, and there's no point bothering to hide your identity, right? I'd rather just get all my money straight to my name.'<br />
<br />
Peter feels himself turning pink in embarrassment under the mask, because there's clearly some hurt there and he- he doesn't want to hurt Deadpool, definitely doesn't want to hurt the guy about to run a needle through his skin. But then, he'd also forgotten about the trained and paid killer part, again.<br />
<br />
'We don't all earn money for what we do, you know,' he says before he can stop himself. He really needs to work on his foot in mouth issue - especially around Deadpool. He's fairly sure Deadpool wouldn't kill him, but he's more aware than ever that he can get stabbed non-fatally.<br />
<br />
'And we aren't all fucking vigilante heroes fighting for truth, justice, and the American way,' Deadpool snaps. 'For one, I'm fucking Canadian. Now are you gonna shut up so I can have a go at fixing you up and you can go skipping off out the window on your merry fucking way to all those many, many people who care about you and are grateful for all your good deeds and hard work?'<br />
<br />
'Yes please,' Peter says. He doesn't squeak, and he doesn't shut up just because Deadpool told him too, either. He was done talking anyway.<br />
<br />
'Right.' Deadpool's anger is strange, a sudden flare of rage that is almost to the point of terrifying, but it's very rarely more than just a flash - at least as far as Peter sees. He knows from Deadpool's rep and the rumours and SHIELD and, on occasion, from Deadpool himself, that it often takes a bit more time and a lot more bloodshed for the anger to pass. As it is, standing in front of Peter in his squalid apartment, Deadpool seems to almost regret snapping. 'I'll just go find... Can't remember the last time I really needed one, but there's gotta be some first aid kit here somewhere, right?'<br />
<br />
'I'd hope you'd know that better than me, since, uh. We're in your apartment.' <br />
<br />
Peter is not proud of his jarred, almost reluctant phrasing, but he's not entirely sure if he should speak again yet. But it seems to work, putting things back on an even keel. To some extent, because he's still pretty on edge.<br />
<br />
Deadpool snorts. 'My apartment, right,' he mutters, and kicks a bag of empty beer cans out of the way on his way to the kitchen. Peter watches as one can rolls out of the bag and a few feet across the floor before coming to a stop. He waits for something to crawl out of it. Nothing does, but he tucks his feet up under himself anyway.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, Deadpool returns with a first aid kit that doesn't look like it hasn't been used in a while - it looks like it's never been used. The white box is nearly brown. Peter eyes it suspiciously. <br />
<br />
'The best I can do at such short notice, Spidey,' Deadpool says when he sees Peter staring at it. 'It's either this or you go pick a needle out of a dumpster, and we all know what kind of shit that can lead to.'<br />
<br />
Peter blinks. 'Different kind of needle, Deadpool.'<br />
<br />
Deadpool sits down on the other cushion and starts to reach for Peter before stopping. Peter waits. <br />
<br />
'You're gonna need to turn round, baby boy.'<br />
<br />
'Don't call me that,' Peter grumbles, and does as he's told. There's a lengthy pause, and he turns to look over his shoulder. Deadpool is looking intently away from the wound. 'Everything alright back there? Is it really gross? Too gross even for you? Oh man, it's not gone green, has it? Am I turning scaly?'<br />
<br />
'Who are you, the Green Goblin?' Deadpool mutters. 'I'd be more concerned about black and slimy if I were you.'<br />
<br />
'It's gone black?' Peter asks, trying not to sound panicked. Deadpool snickers.<br />
<br />
'No, I meant... hypothetically. Keep an eye out for black slime, Spidey, you don't wanna deal with that.'<br />
<br />
Peter pretends he has some idea what Deadpool's talking about and nods sincerely. 'So what's the hold up?'<br />
<br />
Deadpool doesn't answer for a second, and when he does, his voice is light and cheery, the same kind of voice Peter uses with Aunt May when he doesn't want her to worry or know there might be something wrong. It's so false it almost makes Peter's skin crawl.<br />
<br />
'You sure you want me to deal with this for you?'<br />
<br />
'Why, you think there's a chance you can make it worse? Is your sewing really that bad?'<br />
<br />
'I'm better at crochet,' Deadpool quips back without hesitation. 'I just figure you might want someone you can trust a bit more to see you all bare skinned and spandex-less.'<br />
<br />
Peter smirks behind the mask. 'I'm not taking the whole suit off, am I?' He ignores the muttered 'shame' from behind him in favour of continuing to talk and pretending he's not blushing. 'Just cut away enough to expose the wound. If you can track me down from just having seen a patch of my shoulder you deserve to make money from being a mercenary.'<br />
<br />
'Really?'<br />
<br />
'No.'<br />
<br />
He falls silent as Deadpool finally gets to work, the cold metal of the scissors on his skin jarring at first, as the shreds around the edges get cut away. He hisses at the first press of the antiseptic wipe clearing away the dried blood and Deadpool calls him a baby under his breath. By the time the needle finally pierces the skin he's mostly unaffected. He takes another look around Deadpool's apartment.<br />
<br />
'You know, considering you earn money for what you do and you're supposed to be very good at what you do-'<br />
<br />
He actually breaks off and waits for the inevitable 'which isn't very nice' growled behind him in an imitation of Wolverine's voice before continuing.<br />
<br />
'Your apartment is really, uh...'<br />
<br />
Peter searches for the perfect word and comes up with 'hideous' at the exact same time that Deadpool supplies 'interesting' with an almost hopeful lilt to his voice.<br />
<br />
'Um.'<br />
<br />
'Oh.'<br />
<br />
There's a brief pause.<br />
<br />
'Is this even your place?'<br />
<br />
Deadpool scoffs. 'You sure think highly of me, huh, Spidey?'<br />
<br />
'You don't exactly encourage faith in your character.'<br />
<br />
Deadpool hums and pulls the needle through. 'You make a compelling point. Yeah, this is my place, for now. I just choose to spend my money on things more important to me than home decor. Things like food, weapons, privacy, more weapons...'<br />
<br />
'I think I get it.'<br />
<br />
'The downside of not having a secret identity is I often come home to find nasty people who want to kill me waiting in my apartment. I care more that once they're dealt with I can afford to quickly move to a new place where it'll take a bit longer to be found again than I care about repainting the walls. I give the money to cover restoration and fixer up jobs to my landlord and get the fuck out of dodge. Take a trip somewhere, get some time out of the city. It's not like I get visitors who are gonna complain about the squalor very often. It's all relative, bug boy, and I like my money well spent.'<br />
<br />
Peter's gaze is fixed on the knife still embedded in the wall. Deadpool notices where he's looking and laughs.<br />
<br />
'Don't worry, it's nothing a quick plaster job can't fix.'<br />
<br />
'I'm kind of worried right now that I'm even thinking this, but you're making a lot of sense,' Peter says slowly. Deadpool hums again, and it sounds a bit cheerier this time. The needle gives a final tug and Peter feels the ends being tied. Deadpool is surprisingly delicate given the fact he's still wearing his gloves. The leather drags over the healthy skin of Peter's shoulder and manages to avoid the newly sewed-up wound. It feels warm and not at all unpleasant. Peter swears he feels Deadpool's thumb brush along the cut away edge of his suit but the touch is too gentle and brief to speak up about it.<br />
<br />
Then Deadpool pushes himself up onto his feet and offers Peter his hand. Peter looks at it for a moment before Deadpool wiggles his fingers in encouragement. So he takes it and lets Deadpool pull him up.<br />
<br />
'You gonna be able to swing home alright?'<br />
<br />
'I think I'll be fine.'<br />
<br />
'And next time you want to pop in for a quick fix up, you just let me know. I mean it, let me know, 'cause you're always welcome Spidey, like I said, mi casa es tu casa, but sneaking up on me is a pretty dumbass move considering I'm almost always heavily armed and definitely always highly dangerous.'<br />
<br />
'That's a big ask coming from the guy who broke into my apartment last week and didn't even bother to wake me up before deciding to crash in my kitchen.'<br />
<br />
'I thought we established that entering without any actual breaking means I technically didn't break in at all. Besides, you're not the kind of guy who's gonna panic and stab someone who turns up on the inside side of your window. I'm really only looking out for your safety here, baby boy.'<br />
<br />
Peter hopes his mask hides his smile. 'What did I say about calling me that?'<br />
<br />
'Uh, that it totally turns you on? Or was that just what I heard, rather than what you said?'<br />
<br />
'Definitely not what I said.'<br />
<br />
'Not necessarily untrue though?'<br />
<br />
'I'm going now, Deadpool.'<br />
<br />
Peter makes his way back over to the window and ignores Deadpool's triumphant crow behind him.<br />
<br />
'Ha! That's an escapist strategy, I know avoidant methods when I see them, this is when you make a quick escape to avoid admitting the truth without having to outright lie.'<br />
<br />
Peter eases himself back out onto the fire escape, careful not to catch his shoulder on the window pane. Deadpool leans out and holds out his fist. Peter rolls his eyes, but bumps his against Deadpool's anyway.<br />
<br />
'Get home safe,' Deadpool fake coos. 'Call me when you get in so I know you didn't hit a building and turn into bug spray. You know like when you're speeding in a car and your window's just covered in little crushed insects that got smooshed when they flew into the glass?'<br />
<br />
'Yes, Deadpool, I know what you mean. I'll make sure I don't become bug smoosh.' Peter pauses, and turns to look at Deadpool, hoping his sincerity comes across through the mask. 'And thanks for this, you really did me a solid here, Wade. Goodnight.'<br />
<br />
He swings away before Deadpool can react up close, but he still hears it from afar when Deadpool cheers and calls after him, 'I knew you loved me too baby!'<br />
<br />

Less than a week later, Peter's pursuing his would-be mugger from the stabbing incident.<br />

&quot;You are the absolute worst,&quot; he tells Scott, because they've gone over this way too many times already. &quot;You're hoarding everything and now there's nothing left for me. You ruined Christmas, you asshole!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
His best friend and recent stepbrother is just laughing at him, that typical Scott sound echoing through his head through his cheap ass headphones. He really misses hearing it in real life, but for now, headphones will have to do. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Scott just continues to laugh at him. &quot;I just offered to let mom and the Sheriff a Christmas without airplane travel and with Kira's cooking. How could they say no to that?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He is not getting out of DC over the holidays - there is too much going on at the office and he could be called in at any moment. He can't be in California when that happens - and so he's not seeing his family this year, and spending the holidays alone, eating pizza and drinking cheap beer while staring at case files and hoping something starts to make sense. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even I could say no to that. You are evil.&quot; He huffs loudly, making the guy at the table next to him glare at him once again. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The busy DC streets haven't been very kind to him while he walks and talks, so he's found a table at a local coffee shop. He needs the caffeine to keep going with his serious lack of sleep, plus he cannot be out in the cold all the time or he'll die. He is a fragile California boy who still isn't used to the East Coast weather. That's why he currently has his hoodie pulled over his ears so that they won't freeze the fuck off. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It was already touch and go with his toes last year. And soon there will be snow. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop laughing at me, you dick!&quot; He screeches at Scott. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tall, Dark, and Brooding at the table next to him turns and growls. Actually growls, like he's a runaway from a Twilight novel. His eyes look bright blue for a second there, before going back to their normal color - which is singular in and of itself. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not laughing at you.&quot; That deep voice is... interesting. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's kind of hot, and really fucking angry. And he has no idea why. What did he do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, dude, what?&quot; He takes out one earbud. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The guy doesn't even look at him, he just continues to glare and growl. &quot;You've been insulting me for ten minutes! Stop calling me dude, or asshole, or dick, or whatever you think passes as a pet name.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A pet name? What the actual fuck is this guy on?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Pet name?&quot; Stiles can feel his eyebrows raising. &quot;I don't bust out pet names on the first date - maybe on the third, but that depends on how well it's going. And dude is definitely not one of the pet names in my repertoire. Neither is dick.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Stiles, what the hell are you talking about?&quot; Scott is generally confused again. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Really, he is not the type for pet names, not in general. But perhaps that is just because he's never been in a relationship long enough to develop them. Or in a relationship, period. Just sex did not a relationship make. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With the amount of work he has on his plate at the moment, a relationship would be a terrible idea. And he's never met anyone he wanted to be with as much as he wanted to be with Lydia, way back when. And since that was never going to happen....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck did I do to you?&quot; Tall, Dark, and Brooding is just not letting this go. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Scott, buddy, I gotta go,&quot; he tells his now rambling best friend. &quot;Apparently I've managed to insult someone without even talking to them. I think that's a record, even for me, but you can check that with my dad. Because I am a gift, and he has years of experience with that.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With the times his father had teased about returning this particular gift, he knew that the Sheriff was just going to laugh when Scott told him about this. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me later,&quot; Scott orders him, a real stretch for that puppy dog goober. &quot;Just to make sure you haven't gotten yourself maimed again.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the point where he'd flip Scott off if they were face to face, but alas... The distance between DC and Beacon Hills kinda made that impossible. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, dude,&quot; he emphasized that word just to piss off the guy even more - because he could. &quot;I was just talking to my best friend. And step-brother. Because our parents got married. And isn't that a trip.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's been a few months, but he's still not over the newness of it. Because while Melissa has always been special, and she's told him a million times over that she does not want to replace his actual mother, it still stings like a motherfucker. He wants a mother, has for years, but he wants <br />
<br />
his<br />
<br />
&nbsp;mother most of all. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And that is never going to happen. Way to rub that in, life. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; he starts up again, &quot;I wasn't talking to you, so no need to get all offended.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The attractive stranger is still glaring at him, so obviously his message is not getting through properly - which makes him think the guy is a lot dumber than he was going to give him credit for. And that also makes him less attractive. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, headphones,&quot; he yanks the other earbud out of his ear and shows both to the unimpressed stranger. &quot;I was on the phone with Scotty. Insults are kind of how we communicate. It's like we're actually brothers. Not that I'd know, because I've never had a brother before. Do you know?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He slowly pushes down the hood on his red hoodie so that the stranger can see that he means him no harm. It is not going to solve the initial misunderstanding, but maybe it will stop the growling. Because that is still a thing for some reason. If not for the all too human snarling speech, he would have some serious concerns about this guy. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I have sisters,&quot; the stranger starts to talk. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stiles waits for more words, but it seems that this stranger is not particularly interested in telling Stiles anything else. Because the guy still hates him. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So he just talks, hoping that somewhere in his rambles he can make the guy think of him as a decent slash harmless guy. &quot;I really don't know if I should be happy for you or offer my condolences. I don't know what sisters are like and pop culture kinda sends a mixed message. I'm assuming there's a lot of teasing involved. That's what I've heard.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At the word &quot;condolences&quot;, the stranger flinches, and Stiles just feels like even more of an asshole. Clearly that is a minefield he really did not mean to step into. But once his foot is in his mouth, it is stuck there for a good long while. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a lot of teasing,&quot; the stranger finally says. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems like it is costing him quite a lot to speak up, but he does it anyway. Stiles really doesn't get this guy, how he can go from yelling and growling and snarling and glaring, to trying to find kindness for Stiles just to keep the conversation going. This guy does not make sense, and Stiles has never been very good with that. But he tries. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for confirming my sitcom-based hypothesis,&quot; he smiles kindly at the stranger. &quot;I'm Stiles.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He holds out a hand for the other man to shake, because he wants to know this person. His magic is already flickering under his skin, dying to reach out to someone new and interesting. His spark is feeling a spark of interest - hah, spark jokes, always fun. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Derek.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The stranger sits himself down at Stiles' table and shakes his hand, briskly, quickly. There is no ceremony to it, and still his spark is desperate to come out and say hello - there is something about this guy that pulls him in. He is just not sure if it's cause the man is hot like burning, or if it's because there's actually something magical about him. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or both. It could always be both. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because the guy - Derek - feels it too, almost leaning in after their hands touch. He stops himself way too quickly, but Stiles can absolutely work with that. He's started from worse places and still ended up in someone's bed. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Der-Bear!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Except maybe not this time. Because Derek cringes at the name, and his eyes widen briefly before he schools them into an expression of... annoyance? Constipation? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Laura. Cora.&quot; Derek is radiating tension now. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Girlfriend? Family member? The sisters!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, the opportunity for mocking is the greatest with that last one. He just really, really hopes that these are Derek's sisters and they are going to make fun of him for something or other and Stiles gets to watch. That would be both excellent entertainment and a way for the universe to make up for having Derek yell at him earlier. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because he really didn't deserve that, insert pout here. Well, okay, he might have deserved it for some of his previous antics, but not from Derek. Right? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is the boyfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What the fuck. Seriously? Is his life actually turning into a Hallmark movie? If it is, color him interested because what a leading man! And he really isn't looking forward to spending the holidays all by himself, no matter what he claims to his family and friends. It may not be true love, but at least there will be shenanigans over the holidays. He pretty much lives for those. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;That's me,&quot; he goes for it, without any prompting from Derek. &quot;Though Der-Bear here did not tell me that you two would be meeting him here. If I'd known, I wouldn't have dressed like Little Red Riding Hood.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Derek is choking on thin air for some reason, so he unzips the hoodie a bit further and makes sure the hood is properly pushed back before smiling happily at him. Because he will always be a little shit and it is best that Derek finds out about that right away, if their relationship is going to last. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At least through the holiday season - he's hoping for a nice family Christmas. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not offensive or anything,&quot; the older sister quickly moves to reassure him. &quot;But it is prime mocking material, and Derek will be hearing about this forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How could a red hoodie be offensive? Like, he is not aware of any religions or cultures that - holy fucking shit, they're werewolves (the flash of beta blue makes so much more sense to him now). Here he is, dressed as a famous fairytale character who almost got eaten by wolves, and while he wouldn't mind Derek eating him (not now, boner), that might make things a bit awkward with the in-laws.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The fake in-laws, who can tell when he's lying. Gotta remember that part. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;At least none of you is wearing wizard robes,&quot; Stiles decides just to even up the score after his discovery. &quot;That would be personally offensive. We don't all have glasses and lightning shaped scars, you know. That's just prejudice.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A red spark extends between his thumb and index fingers, just to show off that he's a harmless little spark and they can trust him. Because he's met a couple werewolves through work, and they aren't exactly open and trusting people in general. Only that kanima guy was worse about his privacy - the fae were actually quite happy to tell him tall tales of the things their people had accomplished over the years. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We could see the sparks between the two of you right away,&quot; the older sister is still the only one speaking. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Derek seems embarrassed, pointedly not looking at Stiles and sipping his black coffee petulantly, but he is also not refuting any of this. At some point, he is going to need to start talking, because Stiles doesn't even know his last name! And that should probably be a dealbreaker for any relationship, even a fake one. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Since Der-Bear here is too embarrassed to introduce me,&quot; he ploughs through with all the tact of a bulldozer, &quot;my name is Stiles. Stilinski. And before you ask: no, my parents didn't name me Stiles Stilinski, they were too busy tossing all the least-used Scrabble letters together and making those into an approximation of a name. So, I go by Stiles. No, I haven't told Derek my real name. That's a marriage only type deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Both sisters laugh, loudly. Derek does not react. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, guess we're taking Derek ring shopping,&quot; the youngest one finally speaks up, voice dry as dust. &quot;What's your ring size?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I'm pretty sure grandma's ring won't fit,&quot; the oldest sister is staring way too closely at his hands. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stiles looks at Derek, trying to catch his eye, but clearly his boyfriend is way too busy joining his sister in the staring. He's heard people talk about his mouth before - usually in explicit yet flattering terms - but no one has ever been this focused on his hands before. But Derek cannot seem to stop staring, and it is making Stiles have all the explicit thoughts about where he can put those hands. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Der,&quot; he tries to interrupt the staring. &quot;I know you love my hands, and we'll absolutely reintroduce you to them later, I believe that there's a reason your sisters are here.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That makes Derek blush and the sisters cringe, which is all kinds of delightful. Derek's blush is almost subtle, except for the tips of his ears turn a little red as well and Stiles has never been more excited about this Hallmark Christmas movie life he's living. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;They wanted to meet you,&quot; Derek finally lets go of his stupid cup. &quot;Before Christmas. They were worried you'd run off if you met the entire family all at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So this boyfriend he's impersonating is supposed to come around for the holidays - he can absolutely make that work. If work doesn't get too crazy, of course. He can still get called in, because the supernatural division of the FBI just doesn't get holidays. And because he's pretty much at the bottom of the totem pole (he's the youngest and perpetually pathetically single), he's left to work all of the holidays everyone wants to spend with their families. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If that's what gets him the Hallmark Christmas with Derek and his family, he's all for it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not running,&quot; he grabs Derek's hand, hoping it will look adorable. &quot;If the thing about the ring shopping didn't scare me off, neither will your family. My dad is a sheriff who knows about the w-word. You should be the scared one. I can't promise he won't take out his gun when he meets you. It's been just us for so long... He gets overprotective.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The way the siblings flinch collectively means that he has once again stuck his foot in it. And because not every town is like Beacon Hills, where law enforcement is maybe only half human and all the others are at least aware... These people might have encountered some less than pleasant humans - hunters even, maybe. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember what I told you? About Deputy Parrish? Dad's second? He's a hellhound,&quot; he just continues to babble, hoping it helps. &quot;So he's pretty used to the wacky stuff. And when he sees how happy you make me... It'll be fine, Der.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That seems to have saved it, which is good, because he does not want to be the throwaway bonus love interest in the Hallmark movie.The one that no one actually cares about. He does not want to be the roadblock to Derek finding his actual Christmas soulmate. He wants to be the fake boyfriend that teaches Derek to be happy again. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Really, he has no problems with being the manic pixie dream boy for a while.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;That's adorable,&quot; the older sister is smiling widely. &quot;Mom is going to die. Uncle Peter is going to mock you forever and ever until the end of time, but Mom will be happy that finally someone is properly appreciating her baby boy.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Derek continues to look shy, and embarrassed, and maybe even a bit wounded. So Stiles reaches out, grabbing Derek's warm hand in his and squeezing. He is probably just making it worse - even though a gesture like this would solidify their cover - and any second now Derek is going to flinch away from him and reveal the truth. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Laura,&quot; Derek growls, clinging to Stiles' hand. &quot;Can you give us a minute?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So the older sister is Laura, and the younger one is Cora. That's helpful. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Canoodle in peace,&quot; Cora drags her older sister away from them. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No overhearing our conversation,&quot; Derek warns his sisters. &quot;I can still tell mom the real reason why you were late to her birthday dinner.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice, at least the blackmail is reciprocal. He can't wait to get the embarrassing true story out of Derek later, once the sisters are out of normal werewolf hearing range. Which probably means that they'll head to a coffee place around the block somewhere, because if they stay in the building they will be able to hear everything. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How are they supposed to be good fake boyfriends if his sisters know right away? That is, if they're going to keep at the whole fake relationship thing. Maybe he's just an inconvenient stranger who interrupted the actual first meeting between Derek's boyfriend and his family. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not that Derek is talking. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So, dude,&quot; Stiles knows he's the one who'll have to lead the conversation, &quot;I hope I didn't screw anything up for you, but they were expecting a boyfriend and you were kind of lacking one. If your real boyfriend wants to beat me up, please give me a five minute head start. Or ten minutes. Because I'm not that fast, especially not compared to a werewolf.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He just wants to get all of the possible reasons for rejection out of the way, and then they can get to actual movie tropes. He's off duty for the rest of the day and then there's three more days of work before he's on call all through the holidays. Which he will hopefully be spending with Derek's entire family, before Derek falls madly in love with him and asks him to stay forever. And they never reveal to his family that they weren't really dating before. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Isn't that how it works in the movies? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No real boyfriend,&quot; Derek looks almost embarrassed to admit it. &quot;I was going to make up an excuse. But you were there.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stiles smiles, because he's an idiot. &quot;You're a lucky man.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not that any person would see it that way - most people probably would have held out for someone a lot better than Stiles, but Derek probably didn't have any better options. Sure, there are probably a lot more attractive guys drinking their coffee, but he'd just been holding Stiles' hand when his sisters had come busting in. That might have tipped the scales in his favor a bit. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But would that make Derek lucky to have him? Maybe - at least he now has someone who is going to make him talk even if it kills him.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again, he has to make the first move. &quot;So, details. You're going to need to tell me a lot more than your first name if we're going to make this work.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because it is absolutely going to get awkward if he gets tripped up on questions about Derek's day to day life or even his last name. He knows nothing about this guy except his first name, and that he is a rather introverted guy with two meddling sisters and a mother who adores him. Which is not a lot to go on, even for someone with profiling training. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You're staying?&quot; Derek apparently did not expect that. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He just smiles, because Derek doesn't know him yet. &quot;Of course I am, dude.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Derek has no idea who Stiles is, what he does for a living, or even what kind of a person he is. Derek knows he's the son of a sheriff who has a step-brother slash BFF named Scott, and that he was impulsive enough to pretend to be his boyfriend. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't call me dude.&quot; That Derek knows about him. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And Derek is about to get another lesson in just how annoying he can be. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Der-Bear, honey,&quot; he cuts off his endless list of nicknames at the look on Stiles' face. &quot;I'm staying. I don't have anything else going on, except work. My entire family is on the west coast. Not that there's a lot of us. And besides, how many chances am I going to get to be the lead in my very own Hallmark holiday movie?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The best friend? Probably a ton of opportunities. He'd been the sassy best friend when Scott and Allison dated, when he started dating Kira, when Lydia and Jackson got back together last year, after they'd been broken up for years after the whole mess in junior year (and the mess that brought them back together)... He could do that part asleep, with his hands tied behind his back. He just never expected to be male lead material. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Especially not starring opposite Tall, Dark and Brooding Derek. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, in the roughly five minutes Laura and Cora had given them to discuss things privately, they'd run through all the basics. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New information, a summary:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Derek is from a big family, the close knit Hale pack that he vaguely remembered from when they lived back in Beacon Hills (seriously, what the fuck were the odds on that!). They'd moved to the DC area when hunters set their home on fire, something they'd only managed to escape because a teenage Laura and Derek caught Derek's girlfriend at the time in the act of closing the wolfsbane circle around the house. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And oh yeah, that girlfriend was Allison's aunt, and a mature adult seducing a fifteen year old boy to find out his family's secrets. Which, if he ever did get back to California, he was going to have a serious word with Chris Argent about that part. Why? Because, gross and evil and completely not okay in any way, that's why. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, they'd talked through the stuff Derek had told his family about his fake boyfriend. Turns out, not that much of a stretch for Stiles: demanding job (he definitely has that covered, since his three days of work have already turned into four and a half, and it is not Monday yet), meeting only four months ago (so they have a valid excuse not to know everything about each other yet). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Derek did tell them they met at a bar, but he did not mention how they got to talking - and the sisters have definitely been jumping to their own conclusions about what happened and how that meeting led to a relationship. (&quot;Sex, Derek. They think we had a ton of sex and then decided to date. Or you got desperate and granted me a boon.&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They were on the subject of boundaries and PDA when the sisters came back into hearing range. That was an interesting conversation, because Stiles is pretty much comfortable with whatever - and would love to cross kissing Derek off his bucket list - but Derek was a little too sure that nothing was going to happen (&quot;You know there's going to be mistletoe, right?&quot; &quot;Stiles, we're werewolves.&quot; &quot;Right. But your sisters are absolutely going to make us kiss.&quot;). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course that last bit was the first thing that Laura and Cora heard, and they agreed immediately - not that Stiles could hear exactly what they said to make Derek blush like that. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And now it is Sunday afternoon, the 23rd of December, and Derek is calling him at work.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey babe,&quot; he picks up the phone right away, smiling pettily at his coworkers. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;At least it isn't dude,&quot; Derek replies, sounding like he's rolling his eyes. &quot;I'm just calling because my Mom insists on us staying over, at least through Boxing day and maybe longer if you can handle it. You can make up a work emergency to get out of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's adorable - Derek is warning him about sleepovers and bedsharing, like he hadn't accepted with full knowledge of the trope. He's seen (and enjoyed) many movies on the topic, and the few hours he'd spent at home were spent doing research. Because that's just the kind of guy he is. Thorough. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And if he gets to smugly say sweet nothings to Derek on the phone while the few colleagues with more pathetic lives than him have to listen along... Well that's just a coincidence. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Now why would I want to do that?&quot; He is delighted at the progression of the plot. &quot;Your family can't be that awful. It'll be fine. Unless you're planning to be done with me. And the whole conversation about the ring kind of contradicts that.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After four months, a conversation about rings is a lot, but he knows enough about werewolves that they tend to move quickly once they find someone they think would be a good partner. Oh God, fuck, does he smell like an actual partner to Derek? That is so fucking awesome and beyond terrifying at the same time!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Stiles,&quot; Derek sputters, and shit he loves this movie so much. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Should he smell more like Derek, though? He really hasn't considered the werewolf aspect of his Hallmark movie too much - he hasn't been able to find any movies about that side of things, just whole bunches of explicit fanfiction that he has not been able to read without blushing and/or jerking his dick raw. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Werewolves are a kinky bunch, apparently. And they can smell arousal, so that is going to be really fucking interesting when he's sharing a house with a bunch of them - and sharing a room with Derek - for days on end! He's pretty close with his old friend mortification, so he'll probably be fine. Or at least he'll live. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be fine,&quot; he is smiling at his phone now, like this is something real. &quot;Promise. If you do get sick of me, I can't blame you, and I promise to make up some random monster that only I can capture. My safeword is kanima, what's yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course Derek is perfectly silent at that. Stiles wouldn't expect anything different. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It is quiet on the other end for much too long, so it's time for him to talk again. &quot;Look, I promise I'm taking this seriously. I'm happy to get to know your family, and I want to spend the holidays with you. If you still want me to.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this the part where the pining starts? Because he's into it. He's into Derek, the strange mix of growling and glaring and blushing and rolling his eyes. He would have been into him even if they hadn't been fake boyfriends, and this is just the excuse to explore it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe after this whole thing, he'll ask Derek out for real. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll pick you up at six-thirty tomorrow,&quot; Derek finally speaks again. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Who knows? Maybe Derek will actually say yes. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He has been home for roughly twenty minutes when Derek texts him that he's arrived. His hair is still wet from the shower, his work go-bag has been co-opted (minus some of his weapons weapons and plus one sappy gift for Derek), and he is actually getting nervous about the whole deal. Which is stupid, but it's still happening. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But as long as he does not give himself any time to think about that, he will be fine. So he hoists the way too heavy bag over his shoulder, barely remembers to lock the door behind him, and runs down the stairs without falling on his face for once. He stares wide eyed at the seriously sexy car pulled up in front of the apartment, and then tries to quit gaping before the seriously sexy guy in said car notices the drooling. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm here,&quot; he announces, throwing his bag in the trunk. &quot;Sorry to keep you waiting, but work has been a pain in my ass and I only got home half an hour ago. I figured not having kelpie gunk in my neck might be a good thing for meeting the family.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Derek just gives him a look, in that way he has that says more than a thousand words. Stiles would just rather say the thousand words, because silence is not his friend. It gives people way too much time to consider him and look at him closely. So, yeah, talking is better. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea,&quot; Derek is darkly sarcastic, and he adores it already. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So, your family,&quot; he is fishing for a mission report, because he's a damn good agent and he's not going in without more intel. &quot;Your sisters, your mom, your uncle. Anyone else?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He barely has his seatbelt on before Derek peels away with a speed that belies that he's been a werewolf for all of his life. Clearly human mortality has never been a concern of his, because he's gracefully maneuvering through traffic at a speed that would absolutely make the sheriff kick his ass. But his dad has never seen these particular werewolf reflexes at work - Stiles still feels safe in the car, as Derek comes to a stop before a red light. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;My brother and my dad,&quot; Derek glances at him briefly before the light changes. &quot;Uncle Peter's wife is pregnant. She can't drink, and so neither can Peter.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm on call still, so neither can I,&quot; he shrugs. &quot;Besides, wolfsbane booze has never agreed with me. I've tried it twice and it gets me worse than tequila.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And oh, he has some stories about his love-hate relationship with tequila, college tales of drunken debauchery that he barely remembered in the morning. Of course, most of it had been well-documented by his friends and foes alike, so thanks for that. But wolfsbane infused alcohol? That can kill a human. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't drink,&quot; Derek's jaw is tightly clenched. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So there's a story there. One he knows he isn't entitled to. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So, your sisters' names, they rhyme,&quot; he randomly changes the subject. &quot;Does that mean that your brother's name is Eric? Derek and Eric? No?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again, Derek gives him that look that is supposed to tell him that he is a terrible person and he should be ashamed of himself. Instead, it just makes him happy that he is getting to Derek, and that he is on the right path to teach Derek how to have fun. Soon he'll actually make fun of Stiles in return and everything will be as it should be. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Not everyone can be as lucky as you,&quot; Derek is wonderfully sarcastic. &quot;But no, his name is Owen. He's the oldest, so you probably have never heard of him. He lives in New York with his wife. She might not be there, if she's not feeling up to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No other significant others I need to know?&quot; Stiles does not believe that, because that would not be fair to Derek. &quot;I'm sure your sisters wouldn't be so worried about you dating if they hadn't been happily married themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Scott has been getting a lot worse about Stiles' lack of a significant other since he'd married Kira and they got their perfect little house all fixed up. He can relate, and even though Derek is not even looking at him, he still feels like he can see him much better now - like he is actually getting to know the pieces that make up Derek Hale. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Cora and Isaac are getting married next year,&quot; Derek drives them right out of the city. &quot;Laura and her husband Paul have a set of twins named Luke and Leia.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Laura is a woman after his own heart. He feels like he will absolutely get along with Laura's husband too - he's already scored points that Scott will never gain because he is an idiot with bad taste. Ugh, his best friend is the worst. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stiles is trying to contain his excitement, and failing. &quot;I love your family.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this the time where he worries that this is not actually a Hallmark movie, and he's instead ended up in a horror movie? Because he's already dropped a bar on his cell service, and they are definitely headed into a wooded area. Nah, he's got a gun and his magic, and while he did not bring any wolfsbane with him because he wants the Hales to like him, he can definitely handle himself if the werewolves decide to make trouble. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He would never leave the house without mountain ash. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;They will undoubtedly fall all over themselves for you,&quot; Derek rolls his eyes as he deftly steers them onto a well-hidden road. &quot;I don't bring people home.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because he has Issues. That much is obvious - he's already mentally preparing for the shovel talk that is undoubtedly coming his way from at least one of Derek's siblings (he'd put money on Cora if there was anyone willing to take that bet). They care about Derek, and just the mere fact that Stiles actually exists to be actually invited to spend Christmas with the family, means that he is basically a miracle come to life. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course they're going to get suspicious - but not for the right reasons. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, I'll turn those pity likes into love for me before the presents even come out,&quot; Stiles knows where his talents lie. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;With your wit?&quot; Derek appears to be asking for the sake of it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stiles can see right through that though - he is a little shit and like calls to like. Derek is definitely making fun of him, even though his smile isn't showing. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Eat me,&quot; he returns, perfectly pleasantly. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Not tonight.&quot; Derek is quick with that reply. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, he will absolutely take Derek up on that inadvertent offer at a later time. And Derek knows that, judging by the hint of a smile on his handsome face. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Derek, how many people around you are completely convinced you don't have a sense of humor?&quot; Inquiring minds need to know. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;All of them,&quot; Derek is actually slowing down as they reach the end of the forest road. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Has to suck to be that wrong,&quot; he remarks, taking a final opportunity to look at Derek without him noticing. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then he looks ahead as they approach the house - nay, the mansion - hidden in the middle of the forest. That is some house. He knows that the Hales were basically werewolf royalty before they left California, but clearly the move across the country hasn't hurt them at all. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I call you Prince Derek?&quot; He has to check, to be an asshole. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Derek stares straight ahead. &quot;Only if you want me to leave you stranded in the woods.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He is enjoying the banter </td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">The office of the Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry looked nearly the same as it had the last time Hermione Granger had been there, over six years ago. It was quite heart-warming, she had to admit, that both Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape had decided against altering much of Albus Dumbledore's old office. The few changes were small, such as the jar that once held lemon sherbets and was now filled with biscuits, the large tartan rug on the floor, and an entire row on one of the book shelves that was dedicated to copies of  Transfiguration Today. <br />
<br />
It felt a little surreal sitting opposite the headmistress at nearly twenty-five years old, her hands clasped together in her lap to keep from fidgeting. She had been certain of this choice, and still was, but the reality of following through with it was a little frightening. Hermione had not been back in the UK in over two years. <br />
<br />
She had been studying towards a Mastery in Transfiguration in Venice when she ran into her old professor at a celebratory dinner party. She supposed she shouldn't have been so surprised to see her there, given that Minerva had introduced her to the wizard she was studying under, but the moment she saw her again, Hermione had frozen in shock.<br />
<br />
Minerva McGonagall had appeared equally surprised. Two years prior, she had assisted Hermione in what one might call 'fleeing the country'. After practically her entire life blew up in her face, Hermione had been desperate to leave, to abandon ship, and Minerva had helped her by putting her in touch with a Transfiguration Master living in Italy that had once been a student of hers at Hogwarts. His name was Malcolm Adler and he'd graduated five years ahead of Hermione, giving him just enough time to bolt when the war started. <br />
<br />
No, it wasn't Hermione's presence there that had surprised Minerva. It was the fact that she'd arrived in time to see Malcolm with his hands up her skirt outside the restaurant. Once upon a time, Hermione would have thought that had been one of the most embarrassing moments of her life. Now, it didn't even rank.<br />
<br />
The dinner party had been thrown by Malcolm in honour of Hermione completing her Transfiguration Mastery, and was attended by all those they worked with at his lab. After dessert, while everyone was happily chatting amongst themselves over drinks, Minerva had taken Hermione by the arm and whisked her out the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've come a long way from the young girl I met all those years ago,&quot; Minerva had said as they strolled along the narrow streets at dusk, her wizened face solemn. &quot;I hope you know how truly proud I am of you and your many accomplishments. You've grown into a brilliant young witch, that much is clear to anyone who has the pleasure of making your acquaintance. But, Hermione, it is time to come home.&quot;<br />
<br />
She'd then offered her a job teaching Transfiguration at Hogwarts, and, seeing as Hermione had no interest whatsoever in returning to the Ministry of Magic, she'd accepted. Now she sat in the headmistress's office in mid-August, downright terrified of seeing any of her past acquaintances again.<br />
<br />
The only people she'd bothered to stay in touch with during her two years abroad - well, more accurately, the only people willing to speak with her - were Harry and Ginny Potter, George Weasley, Neville Longbottom and (shockingly) Luna Lovegood. The only other post she ever received were a generous amount of Howlers and an unsettling number of death threats. <br />
<br />
&quot;Classes will start, as always, on September the first,&quot; Minerva said promptly, drawing Hermione from her thoughts. &quot;You will have these next two weeks to settle into the castle and come up with a curriculum for the year. Of course, there is a curriculum already in place,&quot; she added, with a hint of a smirk, &quot;but I am quite sure you've already made plans to refurbish it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione smiled sheepishly. &quot;Only because there's been so many advances in recent years that need to be included,&quot; she said. &quot;Not because you were ever anything other than a thorough teacher.&quot;<br />
<br />
Minerva smiled, but her face slowly fell and she began to frown. Those narrowed eyes behind her square-rimmed spectacles and those pursed lips created an expression Hermione had not seen in a very long time, and she felt much like a child again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked apprehensively.<br />
<br />
After a moment's hesitation, Minerva sighed and removed her spectacles. She folded her arms over her desk and fixed Hermione with a determined, yet sympathetic look.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid you are not the only new hire this year,&quot; she said. &quot;I was hesitant to tell you, seeing as this new hire is not someone you share a particularly pleasant history with. I was unsure as to whether or not you would agree to take the job if you knew.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione's immediate thought was Draco Malfoy, but that was ridiculous. Well, she thought so anyway, until Minerva went on to explain that he would be teaching Charms starting that year. The portrait of Severus Snape had to remind Hermione to shut her mouth, else she would catch flies.<br />
<br />
&quot;But - but -  why?&quot;  she finally said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Filius announced his retirement this past April,&quot; Minerva explained, somewhat grimly. &quot;He and I were going to search together privately for an appropriate replacement for him, but it would seem the Malfoy family still has eyes everywhere and they caught wind of our plans. Mr Malfoy approached us that very week to apply for the position.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Granger, are you incapable of shutting your mouth or do you plan on continuing to act like a codfish?&quot; asked Snape's portrait. <br />
<br />
Hermione hastily shut her mouth again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now, Severus,&quot; said Dumbledore's portrait calmly. &quot;She has every right to be a little surprised. You were, too, if I recall correctly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snape sneered at him but fell silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did - did Malfoy say  why he was interested in the position?&quot; Hermione asked, finally finding her voice.<br />
<br />
Minerva straightened up slightly. &quot;He did not, and I decided against asking him,&quot; she said severely. &quot;He was, in fact, an exceptional Charms student, and completed a Mastery after graduating. He is more than qualified to teach the subject and I think it would do us no good to question his motives.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione frowned, but said nothing. She couldn't see why Malfoy would have any interest in returning to Hogwarts, let alone to teach. That said, she didn't want anyone questioning her motives either, since she was, essentially, continuing to hide from both muggle and wizarding society.<br />
<br />
&quot;He will be arriving later this afternoon and I plan on introducing you both to the rest of the staff at dinner this evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded slowly, still rather bewildered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, seeing as we're finished up here,&quot; Minerva went on, smiling once more, &quot;there is someone waiting outside to show you to your living quarters that is very anxious to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, it was Hermione's turn to smile. She stood to hug the headmistress and thank her for this opportunity for the dozenth time before racing out the door, down the spiral steps, and practically leaping into the arms of Neville Longbottom.<br />
<br />
He swung her around, grinning from ear to ear, his face slightly pink, and gave her a final squeeze before setting her back down to look at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin, Hermione, don't ever run away like that again,&quot; he said breathlessly, and she couldn't help but giggle. &quot;I hope you know how much I've missed you, how much we all have. It's good to finally have you back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's good to be back,&quot; said Hermione, though she wasn't quite sure if she was telling the truth. &quot;I have to admit, knowing that you were teaching Herbology here definitely helped me in making my decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neville laughed, his eyes bright with glee, and Hermione took a moment to survey him; he looked pretty much the same as the last time she'd seen him, but there was a certain confidence that hadn't been there before. He had grown into a strong and handsome man following the war, but she wondered if this new self-assurance was the doing of his new girlfriend, Hannah Abbott, who he'd written to her about on countless occasions.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He took her arm and led her through the numerous corridors and stairwells she'd spent her childhood sneaking about with Harry and Ron, taking her to the fourth floor, where her living quarters were. It was a small apartment hidden behind a tapestry and a password-guarded portrait. There was a single and plain bedroom, a bathroom, and a small living area completed with a quaint wooden breakfast table. The windows on the far side of the room looked out upon the Black Lake and the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Her trunks had already been brought up by house-elves, but she tried to ignore that fact.<br />
<br />
&quot;So - erm - now that you're back,&quot; Neville began tentatively, sitting at the table while he watched Hermione unpack, &quot;am I allowed to update you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked absently, her attention focused mainly on placing her books on their shelf in alphabetical order. Then it hit her. &quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned to face Neville, feeling her face heat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I'm going to have to hear about him eventually, aren't I? It would probably be best to hear it from you. You know, an outside perspective.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neville smiled grimly, then glanced down at his lap, his brow furrowed. It took him a moment to speak; he seemed to be choosing his words carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he and Lavender decided to get married, for starters. They'll be celebrating their two-year anniversary next month. They're expecting another kid soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione inhaled sharply, and forced herself to continue putting away her books, though her hands were shaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have a home near the Burrow, and from what Harry and Ginny tell me, they spend quite a lot of time there,&quot; Neville continued carefully. &quot;Ron quit his job in the Auror Office pretty soon after you left. He co-owns Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes with George now. He likes it much better than being out in the field or filling out paperwork. He's ... erm ... quite a bit happier there.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded her head to show that she was listening, but he was still staring at his lap and did not notice her.<br />
<br />
&quot; The Daily Prophet  doesn't really bring up what happened so much anymore, not unless there's a piece on their relationship. The engagement announcement brought everything back up, but since then it's mainly been small mentions here and there ... I can't say the same for  Witch Weekly  though ...&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione blinked and stopped, turning her head to stare at Neville; she had never heard his voice take on such a dangerous tone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pavarti Patil is now assistant to the editor and she and Lavender have always been close,&quot; he said, and he gave a humourless laugh that was extremely unsettling coming from someone normally so kind. &quot;She likes to bring up what happened in nearly every issue. Even included the photographs on the one-year anniversary. Don't worry though,&quot; he added quickly, glancing up at her, &quot;they're still not allowed to print the whole picture, so you were covered up.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fact didn't make her feel much better. She had never been more glad that her parents were still living in Australia with no idea who she was. The images they must have seen in papers, magazines and gossip sites alike of some unclothed girl pressed up against a window being taken from behind by the American ambassador's son would have been far more disgusting to them if they'd known it was their own daughter.<br />
<br />
Ginny had taken her out that night to a club in muggle London in the hopes of taking her mind off of Ron. They thought they'd be safe from reporters there, but when Hermione got drunk and went home with a good-looking man that turned out to be an ambassador's son, she hadn't realized she needed to worry about muggle paparazzi as well. Partially blacked-out pictures of her had been on the front page of muggle papers the next day, followed by magazines, and the news rapidly made its way to the wizarding world. She thanked the god she didn't believe in every day that wizards had yet to discover the internet, otherwise they, too, would've seen the unedited version of those pictures, not to mention the video.<br />
<br />
She had been painted as a party girl and a harlot, and, seeing the photos herself, she couldn't blame anyone for believing it. She was followed and photographed by both muggle and wizarding reporters for weeks before eventually quitting her Ministry job and fleeing the country with the help of her old mentor. Any hopes she had of becoming Minister for Magic one day were dashed and the respect she'd garnered from her role in Voldemort's defeat diminished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do people ...&quot; She paused, taking a steadying breath. &quot;Do people still talk about it? I mean, are people going to have problems with me - you know - teaching their children?&quot;<br />
<br />
Neville frowned and shifted a little in his seat. She hadn't seen him look so uncomfortable since Snape taught them Potions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember in our fifth year, when Harry was brought up in the Prophet from time to time?&quot; he asked hesitantly. &quot;How they'd mention him to, you know, make a joke? It's sort of like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione sniffed and nodded. &quot;Fantastic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neville was watching her, looking like he wanted to comfort her, but she couldn't handle anymore of this embarrassment right now. This was exactly what she had left to avoid. Her eyes were already burning, and she knew she'd be in tears soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for - for telling me,&quot; she said, hating that her voice broke. &quot;I'll just see you at dinner, if that's alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded in understanding, gave her another hug, and left her to finish unpacking. He had barely been gone a minute before she was sobbing on the floor. It had been a long time since she was forced to deal with this, and to be honest, she wasn't sure if she ever really had dealt with it. She doubted running away could be classified as a healthy coping mechanism, or a coping mechanism at all. <br />
<br />
It had all started with one of her and Ron's fights, which were nearly always about the same thing. He wanted to start the next chapter of his life - she didn't want to stay home and become the next Mrs Weasley at twenty-two. She'd said she was done, and he thought she was talking about their relationship. She had meant the conversation. He'd gone out and didn't return until the next morning. One month later, Lavender Brown showed up pregnant on their doorstep.<br />
<br />
Everything deteriorated fairly quickly from there.<br />
<br />
It was nearly nightfall by the time Hermione had calmed down. She went to the bathroom to freshen up, changed her clothes, and headed down to the Great Hall to face the world she'd left behind for the first time in two years. To say she was nervous would be an understatement.<br />
<br />
Neville, being the good friend he was, was waiting for her at the doors when she arrived. She took his arm and allowed him to lead her inside. With the students home for the summer, the usual house tables had been replaced with one large table in the middle of the room. It looked as though the rest of the Hogwarts staff was already there waiting. There were only two seats left, and she could tell straight away why they were the ones left empty.<br />
<br />
His hair was just as blond as she remembered it, his features just as sharp, and his cool exterior perfectly intact. Draco Malfoy sat at his seat, inspecting the cutlery laid out before him, likely to avoid meeting any of the suspicious looks he was receiving from those surrounding him. Though, lucky for him, the second Hermione approached the table, all of the unwanted attention was on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you all settled in?&quot; Minerva asked, as Hermione and Neville took their seats on either side of Malfoy, clearly attempting to diffuse the tension. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; she said, and a second later, their food had appeared on the gold platters before them. Everyone helped themselves, and she copied Malfoy by keeping her head down. This tactic wasn't so successful, however, seeing as she, unlike him, was not feared.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did See it coming,&quot; Professor Trelawney said suddenly, sounding troubled, &quot;but I thought I had Seen wrong. It was the first time I'd ever doubted my predictions. I didn't think there was any way it could have been you that I had Seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione's face went bright red, she was sure of it. She looked up to find the entire table staring at her, even Malfoy. For some reason, his cool gaze felt the most unnerving. Minerva sighed irritably. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's good to know your Sight is still intact,&quot; said Hermione coldly.<br />
<br />
Malfoy snorted.<br />
<br />
The entire table fell silent. Minerva was shooting a deathly glare in Trelawney's direction, though the self-proclaimed Seer did not seem to notice. Then a young woman on Hermione right piped up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this is fucking awkward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Minerva dropped her fork; it fell to her plate with a clatter. She leaned forward to place her face in her hands, shaking her head in exasperation.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the last time, Veronika,&quot; she said, &quot;the use of that language is not permitted whilst working in a children's institution.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman named Veronika smiled guiltily and tucked a strand of her sunshine-coloured hair behind her ear. She had a strange child-like innocence to her features, though she couldn't be much younger than Hermione.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Minnie,&quot; she mumbled, and then she turned to face Hermione so quickly that it startled her. She stuck out a hand. &quot;Veronika Smith, it's nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you.&quot; She winced. &quot;Shit, that's not what I meant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Veronika,&quot; warned Minerva.<br />
<br />
Veronika gave Hermione a sheepish look, though she did not lower her hand. Slowly, Hermione reached out and shook it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was three years below you at Hogwarts, but you probably knew my brother, Zacharias,&quot; said Veronika. &quot;I teach Potions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Hermione could respond, Veronika leaned over her to extend her hand again to Malfoy. He eyed it warily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, get over yourself, I'm merely being polite,&quot; she snapped, and he gently shook her hand, frowning. &quot;There you go. That wasn't so hard, was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy raised his eyebrows at her. Hermione could tell they were both thinking the same thing - that Veronika was a horrifying amount like her older brother.<br />
<br />
It was unclear whether or not Veronika caught on to their apprehensiveness, because she then asked Neville to pass her the mashed potatoes and proceeded to stuff her face with them. Seeing such a petite person eat so much reminded Hermione of Ginny, and she found herself smiling. That is, until Malfoy finally spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Granger, what brings you back from wherever it is you ran off to?&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused, a spoonful of potatoes halfway to her mouth. She slowly lowered her spoon and looked at him, expecting to see that same smug, superior look he'd always given her. Instead, he merely looked amused. Somehow, that was worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;I finished my Mastery,&quot; she said, shrugging in an attempt to appear unaffected. &quot;It was time to come back.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded, smirking.<br />
<br />
She raised an eyebrow at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what, pray tell, brings you here?&quot; she asked coolly. &quot;Last I heard, you were engaged to be married. You know, getting ready to start popping out more heirs to continue on with the Malfoy name.&quot;<br />
<br />
For some reason, this made Malfoy look even more amused. That had not been the effect she was going for.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was quite a while ago,&quot; he said calmly. &quot;As for why I'm here, I guess you could say, a change in scenery.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hummed in response and returned to her meal, because she truly had no idea what to say to that. Neville was looking particularly nervous. Veronika, unfortunately, was perfectly at ease amidst the tension.<br />
<br />
&quot;He came here for the same reason as you,&quot; she said, chortling. &quot;Fucked up his life and decided to hide out here at Hogwarts.&quot;<br />
<br />
That wiped the smirk right off Malfoy's face. Hermione didn't know whether to be embarrassed or burst out laughing, since she had indirectly been insulted right along with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless,&quot; Veronika went on cheerfully, &quot;I am very glad of your presence. Neville and I get bored sometimes without the kids here so it's nice to have company. Younger company, I mean,&quot; she added, grimacing as she looked up at the other professors. &quot;Sorry, guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione took a moment to wonder why the Smith family continued having children after Zacharias.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may surprise you two to hear this,&quot; Minerva said tiredly, looking at her and Malfoy, &quot;but Veronika is actually very good with her students.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione somehow doubted that.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you teach Potions?&quot; Malfoy asked, leaning slightly towards Hermione in order to see Veronika. She would be lying if she said the closeness didn't make her uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Veronika happily. &quot;I took over last year after Professor Slughorn retired for what he's declared to be the last time. I really do enjoy it. I have a slightly different method of teaching that may or may not have caught some of the older students off guard, but I'm proud to say I'm no Snape. May he rest in peace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She really does teach a whole lot differently than either of them,&quot; Neville said, looking thoughtful. &quot;The old dungeon classroom is hardly recognizable anymore. Luna painted it, if you can believe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione looked at Veronika, taken aback.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're friends with Luna?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Veronika, nodding. &quot;Neville introduced me to her just before I started teaching here. I have to be honest with you though, I haven't a fucking clue what have the creatures she painted are, but the overall effect is nice. It really livened up the place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione chuckled slightly. &quot;I can imagine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're friends with Luna, too, aren't you, Hermione? Hermione. That's quite a mouthful. I'm gonna call you Mione, okay? Anyway, she's told me plenty about you. All good things of course. Though I did have the displeasure of meeting that ex of yours, and I can't say the same there. His kid was cute, I'll give him that, but my god, he was an arse when it came to talking about you. Poor little Rosie, stuck with a father like that. It's a shame, really. Oh Merlin, and don't even get me started on the  mother  -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you just say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Veronika looked up at her expectantly. &quot;Which part?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His daughter,&quot; said Hermione quietly. &quot;What did you say her name was?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Rose. Rose Weasley. Cute name, huh? Suits her real well, too. She really is adorable. What, Neville? Why are you looking at me like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione turned to look at Neville, only to have him lean back in his seat, hiding behind Malfoy. She leaned over Malfoy to see his face, no longer caring how close she was getting. Her entire body was trembling with rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't tell me her name was  Rose  ,&quot; she said in a low voice. &quot;He  actually  named her Rose?&quot;<br />
<br />
Neville's face resembled an extremely ripe tomato. He attempted an apologetic smile, but it turned out looking more like a grimace.<br />
<br />
Hermione leaned back in her chair, and tried to keep her breathing under control. She had a sudden urge to break something. Of all the names Ron could have chosen for his daughter, he had to choose the one they'd picked together. He may as well have punched her in the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm - Hermione?&quot; said Neville cautiously. &quot;You okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhmm. I'm great. So great. Never been better.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure about that?&quot; asked Veronika. &quot;Because you look like you're going to kill somebody.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that, Hermione snapped. She stood abruptly, opened her mouth, then closed it, deciding it was far too risky to attempt to speak in her current mood. So, instead, she turned right around and stormed out of the Great Hall, wishing, for the first time in two years, that she could see Ron Weasley again.<br />
<br />
Because she wanted to crack open his skull.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the comments on the first chapter, I'm glad people seem to like this fic so far. I don't know how often I'll be updating but I'm on a roll right now so I'm going with it.<br />
<br />
The fact that Hermione had been back for less than twenty-four hours and was already hiding out in the Hogwarts library was truly shameful. Kreacher the house-elf, who still worked in the kitchens, served her breakfast in her private living quarters so she wouldn't have to show her face to the rest of the staff after having a slight meltdown in front of them. She had never abused a house-elf's eagerness to help like that, but her embarrassment far out-weighed her guilt. She wondered if she'd used up all of that Gryffindor courage during the war.<br />
<br />
Still, she felt at ease the moment she stepped inside the library. It was like returning home after a long vacation; you enjoyed your time in a new place, but it was still good to be home. She even missed the smell of the place, which seemed a little weird.<br />
<br />
Madam Pince took one look at her from her spot at her desk, shook her head in exasperation, and then returned to the book she'd been reading.  Yes, yes, I'm predictable,  Hermione thought, rolling her eyes. She spent the better half of her morning exploring the library, reveling in the fact that, with the students gone for the summer, she had it all to herself. An hour had passed, during which she simply walked up and down the aisles, reacquainting herself with her favourite books, before finally settling down at her old table with  Hogwarts: A History.  <br />
<br />
She hadn't even opened the book before she was met with a horrifying sight; there, on her table, someone had engraved the words,  Harry Potter Rules! She immediately withdrew her wand to get rid of it -<br />
<br />
&quot;They're kids, Granger, you can't stop them from writing on the desks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione raised her head and narrowed her eyes at Malfoy. He was leaning against a nearby shelf, eyeing her wand with amusement. She then realized it was pointed right at his face and set it down on the table with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;They've damaged school property,&quot; she mumbled.<br />
<br />
Malfoy leaned in, cupping a hand over his ear. &quot;What was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
She glared at him, and he smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew I'd find you here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Madam Pince didn't seem so surprised either,&quot; she said irritably, crossing her arms over her chest. She bounced her leg under the table. &quot;Apparently, I'm just about the most predictable person on the planet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don't know about that,&quot; said Malfoy, sounding almost gleeful. He pulled out the chair across from her and sat down, smirking still. &quot;You've certainly surprised me in recent years. I know an awful lot of others feel the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione scoffed, bouncing her leg even faster. &quot;Yes, yes, I - as Veronika so eloquently put it - fucked up my life. Shocked the world, and all that.&quot; She paused, then found herself smirking. &quot;But you apparently fucked up your life, too. Even more so than you already had, if that's possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you're referring to my Death Eater days,&quot; said Malfoy casually. &quot;That's fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
She arched an eyebrow at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I didn't fuck some muggle political figure's son, if that's what you're asking,&quot; he said, but he then sighed, dropping the smirk. &quot;I got a divorce. The rest of pureblood society didn't like that. My ex-wife remarried, so she's back in everyone's good graces. Me, on the other hand ... not so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, and that's why you've chosen to hide out here,&quot; said Hermione knowingly. &quot;I can't say I blame you. I know what it's like to be looked down upon by people like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy smiled grimly. &quot;I deserved that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? Oh, I wasn't referring to you. Though, I suppose you are included in that statement. I just meant that I got quite a lot of letters from some members of pureblood society berating me for making a fool out of myself after they'd  so kindly  welcomed me into the wizarding world. I believe your ex-wife's mother was among them. It was Astoria Greengrass, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Astoria Pucey now, actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione thought for a moment, her mind returning back to her Hogwarts days. &quot;Adrian Pucey?&quot; she asked, and when he nodded in confirmation, she added, &quot;They're going to have some ridiculously good-looking children.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy sniggered, however, his amusement didn't last very long, because he then kicked her under the table, successfully uncrossing her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you quit that? You're shaking the table.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stared at him, mouth agape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just kick me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and I'll do it again if you continue -  hey!  That wasn't very ladylike!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You kicked me first!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now you just sound like a child.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione swung her foot at him again, scowling, only this time he reached down and caught her foot. He held it there while she glared at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you quite finished?&quot;<br />
<br />
She continued to glare at him, and swung her other foot in his direction. This backfired horribly; he scooted forward in his seat to grab the other foot and placed them both on his lap, gripping her ankles tightly to keep her from causing him further injury.<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin, no wonder that hurt so much,&quot; he muttered, studying her shoes. &quot;These heels may be short but they could kill a man. Have you worn them in case you run into the Weasel again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione scoffed, trying to yank her feet from his grasp, but he only tightened his hold, smirking at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I happened to run into him, then I may do just that,&quot; she said hotly. &quot;Serves him right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this about the fact that he named his bastard child the same name you two picked out together for whatever evil spawn you'd hoped to bring into this world?&quot; asked Malfoy, and she frowned. &quot;Longbottom explained after your little temper tantrum last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
She huffed and nodded. &quot;Among other reasons, yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy hummed in response, and began removing her shoes, still grasping her ankles tight enough that she couldn't pull them back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know your plan was likely to get away from it all,&quot; he said, &quot;but have you really been living under a rock all this time? The birth of their child was announced in the  Prophet .&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't let any of my friends tell me about him,&quot; said Hermione quietly, her face going slightly pink as she watched him place her heels on the floor. &quot;Neville gave me a rundown on what I'd missed before dinner. Better to hear it from him than anyone else, I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he neglected to mention the child's name?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it wasn't very creative in the first place. I'd expect you to come up with a better name than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rose is a lovely name, thank you very -  are you rubbing my feet?&quot; <br />
<br />
Malfoy nodded, continuing to massage her heel. &quot;I honestly have no idea how to go about comforting a witch,&quot; he said. &quot;But Pansy used to make me rub her feet when she was pissed off. Thankfully, Theo's taken over that particular job now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Theo Nott?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, he and Pansy got married last spring. He hasn't knocked her up though yet, thank Merlin. I don't think I could handle living alongside a carbon-copy of Pansy Parkinson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; said Hermione, biting her lip. She was trying very hard to look like she was not enjoying this, but Malfoy was apparently an expert at giving foot rubs and she'd already relaxed into her seat. <br />
<br />
He pressed his thumb against a particularly sore spot and she let out a small moan before she could stop herself. He grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where'd you run off to anyway?&quot; he asked, his eyes roaming her face. &quot;You're tan, so it's got to be someplace warm, but I honestly can't picture you living in the tropics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was in Venice,&quot; she said, groaning a little. &quot;Studying towards a Mastery in Transfiguration.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm. I thought you'd wind up teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, if anything. Seems much more suitable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione frowned. &quot;That was actually the only class I didn't get an 'Outstanding' in, if you can believe it,&quot; she said bitterly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And yet you went on to become a war heroine. Interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the one teaching Charms. Never saw that coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malfoy shrugged, continuing to massage her feet and grinning every time she moaned in response. &quot;I've always been partial to charmswork,&quot; he said. &quot;It was my favourite class at Hogwarts. Always came easy to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione nodded, closing her eyes. This was far too relaxing for her to keep up an expression of discomfort. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have unicorn hair as your wandcore, by any chance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those cores are known for being -  ooooh  - exceptional at charms.&quot;<br />
<br />
She heard Malfoy chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. Why, does that surprise you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. But I bet the eleven-year-old Draco Malfoy wasn't too pleased.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, he really wasn't,&quot; said Malfoy amusedly. &quot;I used to tell everyone I had a dragon heartstring core. Seemed much cooler.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione merely nodded in response; she was far too relaxed to speak, her brain had practically turned to mush. She rested her head on the back of her chair, trying to focus on the pleasure rather than the fact that the wizarding world must have flipped upside down in her absence in order for Draco Malfoy to be giving her a foot ma</td>

Prompt: &quot;Wait...don't pull away...not yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sire!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Leon's cry comes too late for Arthur to turn, the sorcerer aiming the staff directly at Arthur's defenseless back. Arthur still tries, moving through molasses as he watches energy crackle from the point of the staff and arc across the clearing towards him. The last thought of please, let it be painless, is interrupted by someone else landing roughly on top of him as they fall to the ground. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The heat of the spell sears the top layer of Arthur's chainmail. He winces, pulls away, realizes he's still stuck on whatever poor soul jumped in front of him. Blinks. Gasps. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin struggles to his feet, eyes on the sorcerer. The sorcerer howls in rage, staff crackling once more. This time, he raises a hand and points at Merlin. Arthur flails, trying to stand, push Merlin out of the way. Then Elyan's sword comes down and breaks the staff in two. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;How dare--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Two seconds later, with the threat of Gwaine and Percival approaching, the sorcerer vanishes. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sire!&quot; Leon hurries to his side, sheathing his sword and lifting Arthur. &quot;Are you alright? Did he injure you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Arthur mumbles. Then he shakes his head and repeats himself firmly. &quot;No. I am not wounded.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He glares at the back of Merlin's head. &quot;Someone jumped in front of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin doesn't turn around, doesn't shoot some quip over his shoulder. He continues staring at the place where the sorcerer was. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Elyan huffs, coming forward to clap Merlin on the shoulder. &quot;Not that it wasn't very brave of you,&quot; he says, &quot;but if you keep doing that I'm going to have to start making you metal armor, not just leather.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine,&quot; Merlin says, holding his arms out and turning to show that, well, he's not visibly injured, &quot;see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't mean it wasn't unbelievably stupid, Merlin,&quot; Arthur growls, &quot;really, jumping in front of unknown magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's my job,&quot; Merlin insists stubbornly, &quot;to protect you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, better than the half-dozen fully armed, fully trained knights?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were too far away! By the time they got there, you could've been--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Now what the hell is Arthur supposed to say to that?<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sensing the tension, Lancelot jumps in. &quot;The point is,&quot; he says quickly with a glance to Merlin, &quot;everyone is alright. No one has been gravely injured, and we are all alive. Let us be grateful for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here here,&quot; Gwaine mutters, turning back to where they left the horses. &quot;Come on. I'm starved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to pursue the sorcerer.&quot; Arthur tugs away from Leon's grip, something pulling him away. &quot;There's no telling how much--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;We aren't equipped for a proper chase,&quot; Lancelot cuts in, &quot;we've barely got enough to make it back to Camelot as it is. Plus, we've got nothing to go on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;The staff,&quot; Arthur argues. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won't tell us where he's gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They all look over to Merlin, who's leaning over the staff. Arthur moves without thinking, walking until he's right next to Merlin. Merlin glances up and shakes his head. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't something we can trace, and he'll be long gone by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why're you such an expert?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin shrugs. &quot;Why would he leave something that could be easily tracked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin's right,&quot; Elyan calls, &quot;there's nothing else here. That's the only thing we've got to go on and it sounds like nothing's going to come out of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Arthur snarls, turning on his heel and stalking toward the horses. Then something jerks him roughly backward. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Did he get caught on something, what's...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He turns around to see Merlin sprawled on the ground. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tripped,&quot; Merlin mumbles, getting to his feet and following Arthur. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is definitely something wrong with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not a clumsiness curse, don't worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You say that like you know exactly what it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin doesn't reply, just stands still and watches Arthur try and mount his horse. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Try. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
His bloody feet won't move. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The other knights haven't noticed, too busy with their own horses. Arthur tries again. Something is holding him in place. He glances around and sees Merlin with a white-knuckled grip on the nearby tree. When he stops trying to move, Merlin relaxes, taking a deep breath and walking a few steps forward. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur mounts with ease. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Bollocks. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The ride back to Camelot is easy enough. Thankfully Merlin normally rides right next to Arthur. Leon sits on his other side, talking strategy for how to find the sorcerer. He also says they shouldn't do too much at first before Gaius checks him out, just to make sure there are no ill effects from the magic. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur agrees. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He's not inclined to bring Merlin with him on sorcerer hunts. Nor is he inclined to bring Merlin everywhere he goes. A man needs his privacy, after all, and Merlin isn't exactly subtle at anything. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Of course, the second they get back and into Gaius' chambers, Uther appears. No one whispers the words 'Arthur Pendragon' and 'magic' in the same sentence without Uther hearing about it. Privately, Arthur's joked that the man's got magical hearing. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Uther hovers, frowning throughout the entire examination until Gaius politely tells him to back off and let him work. Arthur glances at Merlin, fully aware that Uther's status as the king is the only thing keeping him from suffering the full brunt of Gaius' irritation. Gaius comes away with nothing. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you should rest,&quot; Uther says, resting what Arthur's pretty sure is supposed to be a fatherly hand on his shoulder, &quot;remain in Camelot until we can be sure there are no ill effects. Magic can be deceitful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.&quot; Arthur pushes himself off the table. &quot;Merlin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, if you wouldn't mind, Sire,&quot; Gaius says, &quot;I must examine Merlin. If it is true what you say happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin is not afforded the same protection as Uther or even Arthur, and judging by the way his servant's face pales, he's being treated to the full experience of Gaius' disappointed eyebrow. Arthur's amusement vanishes when his father taps his shoulder. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come, Arthur, you can see your servant later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur gets about halfway before he has to fight to keep moving. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin, stop squirming,&quot; Arthur hears. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arthur,&quot; Uther calls from the door, &quot;come.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And before Arthur can say anything Merlin's voice cries: &quot;wait!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Gaius steps back as Merlin lowers his head, jaw working, ears bright red before he looks up at Arthur. Arthur shakes his head as little as he can, saying it's not worth it, whatever Merlin's about to do that has him so obviously upset, Arthur will figure it out--<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can he stay,&quot; Merlin grits out, &quot;please? Just until Gaius is done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin,&quot; Gaius snaps. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin hunches defiantly, using it to mask the way his knuckles are fighting to keep their grip on the table. &quot;I, er, I'm really not good at these and if he's here...it will...help...&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin trails off, the mortification forcing his chin to his chest. Arthur turns when Uther scoffs, telling Merlin to grow up. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Father,&quot; he says, &quot;it's no trouble. I'm...&quot; he leans close, lowering his voice, &quot;I'm used to it. Really, I don't mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then perhaps you should find a new servant.&quot; Uther glances disparagingly at Merlin. &quot;One that isn't a sniveling boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur huffs a laugh. &quot;I doubt he'd leave even if we banished him, you've said yourself how devoted he is to me. He can be quite stubborn for a coward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Uther seems to ponder for a moment. Arthur seizes it. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus, it'll be easier if I just get it over with.&quot; He gestures toward a still-curled up Merlin not moving when Gaius tries to make him. &quot;He jumped in front of the sorcerer's spell to save me. Isn't this the least I can do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Uther glances down at him and nods sharply. &quot;Well, at least it was him and not you.&quot; Arthur grits his teeth and nods. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
With that, Uther sweeps out of his chambers with the command that Gaius come to see him when he's finished. Arthur's chest relaxes when his father disappears, moving closer to the table and perching on a stool. Gaius gives him a strange look and finishes examining Merlin, coming away with nothing. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; he says sternly, &quot;what is it the both of you aren't telling me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin shakes his head. &quot;Nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;He speaks the truth, Gaius,&quot; Arthur says, knowing Merlin's ability to lie is not what it ought to be, &quot;there's nothing physically wrong, you said it yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't mean there's nothing you aren't telling me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fine, Gaius!&quot; Merlin hops to his feet and heads for the door, oblivious--mostly--to the way Arthur is forced to join him. &quot;Bye!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur takes Merlin by the elbow and pulls him to his chambers, despite the protests he gets. The second the doors shut, he lets go, pushing Merlin in front of him. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; he snarls, stalking forward, &quot;the hell was that about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had to convince him to let you stay somehow,&quot; Merlin defends, rubbing his elbow, &quot;didn't I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not what I meant and you know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I really don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you jump in front of me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin sighs, throwing his arms up. &quot;We've been over this! You could've been hurt!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, and that's supposed to--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you rather be forced to not move apart from the other sorcerer?&quot; Merlin's hands start waving wildly. &quot;What with how he disappeared you could've been forced to run for ages! Across who knows what! You would've been walked right out of your boots, unable to stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you didn't know that's what the spell would do,&quot; Arthur argues. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't need to,&quot; Merlin insists stubbornly, &quot;your father said it himself, better me than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since when do you and my father agree about anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;When it comes to having to put up with you being a dollop head!&quot; Merlin drops his arms, walking off in a huff. &quot;You're the one that said it was the least you could do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what was I supposed to do?&quot; Arthur walks further into his chambers. &quot;You're the one that came up with that blasted excuse in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't like it was going to be hard to pull off,&quot; Merlin snarls, turning to glare at Arthur with such venom that it freezes them both in their tracks. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What--&quot; Arthur licks his lips, his entire mouth running dry--&quot;what is that supposed to mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin scoffs. &quot;Like you don't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin.&quot; Arthur takes another step forward, opening his mouth again when Merlin cuts him off. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, please. You make jokes about me being a coward every chance you get. In front of everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin whirls away, unable to go far, the stiffness of his back speaking volumes where physical distance can't. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's not the first time you've done it in front of your father either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin...&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come to think of it,&quot; Merlin says, &quot;why didn't we just tell them in the first place? They're still worried you're going to drop dead at any second--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because my father's method of dealing with unknown enchantments is to kill everything he can!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur's voice rings in the chamber. The anger drains slowly out of both of them, Arthur slumping into a chair, Merlin hovering awkwardly by the table, twisting his tunic in his hands. Arthur pinches the bridge of his nose between his fingers. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;We should figure out how far we can actually get from each other,&quot; he mumbles eventually, breaking the silence. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin nods. Arthur gets up, carefully coming to stand right next to Merlin. They both try in vain to ignore the way the other one tenses when they get too close. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur walks briskly away from Merlin, waiting to feel it snap. They get about halfway across Arthur's chambers from each other before they have to stop. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not far,&quot; Merlin mutters, &quot;I won't be able to--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur frowns when he cuts himself off. &quot;Won't be able to what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...get your food and stuff,&quot; Merlin mumbles, making it quite obvious to the both of them that wasn't what he was about to say. <br />
<br />
<br />
Arthur shrugs. &quot;There are multiple servants in this castle. We'll get one of them to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin nods sharply. Then he turns on his heel, pulling Arthur across the room while he retrieves his armor from the cupboard. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank god the desk is here,&quot; Arthur mutters, pulling the paperwork toward him and burying himself in reports and laws and whatnot. But his mind keeps wandering, focusing on the strange look on Merlin's face when he called himself a coward. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin,&quot; he calls softly, waiting for Merlin to look up, &quot;I...all those jokes about you being a coward...you know I don't mean them, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin's hand freezes on Arthur's armor.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I always thought you were the bravest man I ever knew,&quot; he finishes. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The silence resumes a few moments later, but this time it's not as uncomfortable. Good. If they're going to be stuck together for the foreseeable future, they'd better get along.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin scrubs at the armor, sneaking glances at Arthur. Good. He didn't notice Merlin's slip-up earlier. He's not sure even his magic is enough to break free if Arthur actually finds out. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur yawns, throwing down his quill and glancing at Merlin, crouched as he is over the fireplace and rearranging the logs inside. Standing, he pushes away the dinner dishes and crosses to the wardrobe, starting to pull off his heavy robe. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin,&quot; he calls, &quot;come help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin gets to his feet and comes to join him, helping him shrug off the heavy fabric. He reaches forward to help Arthur pull off the rest of his outer clothes, being very careful not to touch him. Arthur frowns. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin is all pats and pokes and squeezes and familiar touches. Every morning when he helps Arthur get dressed he pats Arthur's chest when he's all finished. He strokes down Arthur's shoulders and slaps his arm when he's being particularly annoying--yes, Arthur can admit when he's being annoying, he's not that oblivious. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But now, he's being exceedingly careful to not touch Arthur, lifting his tunic in a way that his fingers don't even brush the skin of Arthur's chest. He gets Arthur into his nightshirt and turns away, putting everything in the basket to be washed. Ah, yes, they'll have to figure that out too. In the meantime...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin,&quot; Arthur sighs, catching Merlin's arm as he tries to leave, &quot;what do I have to do to make you stop this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, stop the spell?&quot; Merlin scoffs. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Arthur corrects, &quot;stop this. You're walking on eggshells around me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's like you said.&quot; Merlin raises one shoulder half-heartedly. &quot;We're stuck together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't explain this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, you want me to piss you off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin,&quot; Arthur says, &quot;you're doing far more than that. Come on,&quot; he coaxes, getting Merlin to set down the basket, &quot;out with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really rather not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur sighs. He's not sure why he has to push so hard to get Merlin to talk about things with him. So he tries the only one he can think of, even though he knows it hasn't worked in the past. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because I'm a prince doesn't mean you can't tell me,&quot; Arthur says, &quot;plus, as you said. We're stuck together, we might as well talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if that's the reason,&quot; Merlin mutters to himself. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that supposed to mean?&quot; Arthur frowns. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin shrugs. &quot;Can't exactly give you time to process, now can I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur swallows, not willing to let Merlin excuse his way out of it this time. &quot;That's not it and you know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin just shrugs again. &quot;Well, what if I don't want to be in the same room as you after I've told you things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why on earth not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin gives him a look over his shoulder. &quot;Don't stop calling me a coward now, you'll be giving up so many opportunities to gloat about being right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's back. That awful, broken tone is back. Arthur walks forward, staying a respectful distance away. He leans against the bedpost and waits. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin,&quot; he says quietly, &quot;you don't have to be afraid to tell me things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin scoffs and it hits Arthur like a punch to the chest. &quot;Yeah, 'cause you've been so encouraging about me wanting to tell you things before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don't pretend.&quot; Merlin shoves the sheets aside angrily, straightening the bed covers with a savage determination. &quot;Every time I tell you I'm afraid of something or that we shouldn't go somewhere because I've got a bad feeling about it you mock me. You make fun of me for not wanting to go on hunts with you because I don't want to watch you kill things for sport. You tell me my interests are girly and wrong. What, exactly, am I supposed to do with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just teasing,&quot; Arthur tries weakly. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that's supposed to make it better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin sighs, turning away again. &quot;Whatever. It's fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it's not.&quot; Arthur pushes himself off the bedpost, coming to stand right beside Merlin. &quot;I'm hurting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I can be hurt so badly by a few words, maybe I really am--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not,&quot; Arthur says sharply, turning Merlin to face him. &quot;You're not, Merlin. You're...you're completely ridiculous. You're annoying, you're insolent, you're clumsy, and--and--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur squeezes his shoulders tight, relaxing his grip when he sees Merlin wince.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...and you're the best friend I've ever had,&quot; Arthur finishes softly, staring Merlin dead in the eyes and hoping his sincerity bleeds through. &quot;I...I never meant to hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin nods. Well, his head bobbles. He reaches up to carefully pry Arthur's fingers off of his shoulders. &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur waits with bated breath as Merlin turns back towards the bed, smoothing out the covers. His shoulders slump. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin flaps a hand. &quot;Being...whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been cursed to not be more than a few feet apart from each other,&quot; Arthur replies dryly, &quot;I think we're entitled to being 'whatever' for a little.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin chuckles. He finishes with the bed and goes back to finish lighting the candles, the light casting across the chambers. He stands up and immediately curses. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've just remembered I'm not going to be able to go back to my room to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur shrugs. &quot;Just sleep here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;On the floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sleeping on the floor,&quot; Merlin splutters. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur raises an eyebrow. &quot;Asking to share my bed, are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I--&quot; Merlin stops when he sees Arthur giggling at him from across the room. He narrows his eyes. &quot;You prat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know,&quot; Arthur says, &quot;but your face...I'm sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin huffs, crossing his arms. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;But seriously,&quot; Arthur says, gesturing to his bed, &quot;there's more than enough room for both of us. And it's not like we've never slept together before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;On the forest floor, Merlin,&quot; Arthur says, turning to finish pulling on his nightclothes. &quot;Surely this won't be that much more difficult.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It takes a little more cajoling but eventually, Merlin accepts, finishing with the remainder of the chores he can do and coming to hover awkwardly by the bed. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can put the candles out,&quot; Arthur says, jerking his head toward them, &quot;it's not like we'll need them to sleep.&quot; He frowns when Merlin doesn't immediately move to do it. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Merlin says quickly, putting them out. It makes Arthur have to take a few steps this way and that to make sure they're not about to be yanked toward each other but he's too worried about what Merlin's not telling him to be too put out about it. When he's close to the wardrobe, he fishes out another one of his nightshirts and tosses it at Merlin's head. &quot;What's this for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;For you to sleep in,&quot; Arthur replies, getting into bed, &quot;come on, I want to go to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one's stopping you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin, stop being a clotpole and come to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that's how you treat everyone who shares your bed it's a wonder you're alone so many nights.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur hides a smile as he gets comfortable. At least Merlin's back to bantering with him. He closes his eyes, settling into the bed, hearing Merlin's clothing rustle and feeling the other side of the bed dip as Merlin gets in. He frowns. Merlin's practically hanging off the edge of the bed, barely covered by any of the blankets. He turns over. Just as he thought, Merlin's head is barely on the pillow. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that can't be comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin,&quot; Arthur sighs, reaching to pull Merlin more fully onto the bed, &quot;stop being ridiculous. This isn't that much of a problem for me, come on--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He freezes when a strangled noise cuts the air. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Merlin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur sits up, glancing around his chambers. It's dark now, so he can't see much of anything, but he can make out a trembling Merlin on the other edge of his bed. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;God, Merlin,&quot; he mumbles, tugging his servant more carefully under the covers, &quot;there's no need for you to be cold, there's more than enough room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not cold,&quot; Merlin mutters, burrowing his head in his arms and staring resolutely away from Arthur, at the window. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what's wrong,&quot; Arthur asks, &quot;please...&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin shakes his head. &quot;Not in the mood to be teased right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't,&quot; Arthur replies instantly, &quot;I won't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin sighs, letting Arthur pull him further onto the bed and roll him over, still refusing to meet his eyes as Arthur flops back down, having overexerted himself in that position. He waits. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin mumbles something under his breath. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little louder?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid of the dark,&quot; Merlin blurts, curling in on himself, ears burning red again. &quot;There. I said it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Oh, Merlin...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Well, at least it explains why Merlin doesn't like sleeping in the woods alone. Hell, it makes Arthur jump sometimes. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that why you wanted to face the window?&quot; Arthur asks quietly. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;'S light,&quot; Merlin mumbles, &quot;but then I can't see what's behind me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;So me grabbing you didn't help.&quot; Merlin shakes his head. Arthur chews on his lip. Then he makes a decision. &quot;Close your eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Close your eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll forgive me for not wanting to trust you at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not going to hurt you, Merlin. I'm not going to scare you. Just...close your eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to regret this,&quot; Merlin mutters but does as he's bid. Arthur takes a moment to admire how lovely Merlin looks in the dim light before shifting. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin furrows his brow but keeps his eyes closed. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here,&quot; Arthur repeats, opening his arms. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm already in your bed, what more do you want from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like you to come here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin rolls his eyes but edges closer, letting Arthur wrap his arms around him and pull him to his chest. The way he's curled up lets him slot his head neatly under Arthur's chin, Arthur laying them both down on the pillow. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm right here,&quot; he says calmly, using one hand to pull the blankets around both of them, &quot;nothing is going to hurt you. I won't let it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arthur--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh,&quot; Arthur hushes, rubbing his hand up and down Merlin's back, &quot;it's alright. I'm not going anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...you don't have to do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I want to.&quot; Arthur shifts his grip. &quot;Plus, this way, I won't get yanked awake in the middle of the night if you fall off the bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not that clumsy,&quot; Merlin mutters, sleep already coloring his voice. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur hides a smile as he allows his own eyes to drift closed. &quot;Go to sleep, Merlin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Remember all those things Arthur said about how having to stay close to Merlin would be unbearable?<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, as it turns out, living with this curse really isn't that different from what they normally do. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin staying the night in his chambers just means he gets breakfast on time every day, as when they wake up they tell one of the other servants to fetch it. Merlin gets Arthur dressed before breakfast arrives which means it's plenty warm when he tucks in. Merlin gets started on daily chores as Arthur finishes. Training isn't any different; Merlin's there most of the time anyway, and he's close enough that Arthur can move and fight without being yanked closer. If anything, it's been a change for the better. Now when Arthur is summoned to uncomfortable meetings with his father or boring council meetings, Merlin is there to make funny faces just to make him laugh, or accidentally spill a goblet of wine and splutter that they must get him cleaned and changed immediately. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Honestly, Arthur would go as far as to say it's not much of a curse at all. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The only time they really feel it is when they have to go out on patrol. Thankfully, the knights are used to seeing Merlin with them anyway, so they're spared the speculation of why Merlin's here in the first place. Unfortunately...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Princess,&quot; Gwaine taunts, &quot;surely you can stand to be parted from your Merlin for three minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gwaine,&quot; Merlin mutters, whacking the knight on the arm with the waterskin, &quot;stop it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, I can't have you for two minutes alone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't have me,&quot; Merlin retorts, much to the glee of the other knights. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Arthur can?&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
That slaps the grin right off Arthur's face. He knows what Gwaine means by that and that is most certainly not what's happening.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin just snorts, shoving Gwaine away. &quot;Jealousy doesn't look good on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything looks good on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that is a bald-faced lie,&quot; Elyan says, sparking a lively conversation that thankfully lets Merlin and Arthur slip back into the background. Arthur breathes a sigh of relief, coming to stand by Merlin's side. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd think he'd get bored after a while,&quot; he mutters to Merlin. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin chuckles. &quot;I don't think Gwaine gets bored of flirting with everything that moves, no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's been, what, a month now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin nods. &quot;He'll find something else to talk about, I'm sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the sooner we get this curse broken, the better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin glances up at him. &quot;So sick of my company, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sick of your shite, maybe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Liar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur shoves him, unable to stop the fond smile when it just makes Merlin laugh harder. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn sorcerers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They both turn back to the circle of knights where Leon is shaking his head. They join them, Arthur asking what they're talking about. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Telling us about that wild goose chase you sent him on,&quot; Gwaine says with his mouth full, &quot;after that sorcerer a moon back, you remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur nods, trying to keep his cool. &quot;And?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Leon huffs. &quot;Found him. I told him to take off whatever spell he put on you and Merlin. Do you know what he said?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Said the spell was only supposed to last a few hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The pit of Arthur's stomach drops. Leon doesn't notice, continuing to tell his story. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, he vanished again before I could ask what he meant, but...&quot; He shrugs. &quot;At any rate, whatever it was--if it even did anything, it's gone now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The knights keep making jokes but Arthur's not listening. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A few hours?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's been a month. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Judging by the way Merlin's looking like he's gone and turned to stone, he's just realized the same thing. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So they...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Without having to...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hmm.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They get their confirmation when Lancelot offers to help Merlin fill the waterskins. Gwaine huffs, offended, but Arthur just waits. As Merlin and Lancelot vanish over the hill, he waits to be jerked to his feet and run off to join them, but it never comes. It never comes. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He looks up to see Leon staring at him, concerned. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Leon,&quot; Arthur says, &quot;just tired. What were you saying about the purple saddle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When they get back to Camelot, Arthur immediately hustles Merlin into his chambers, not saying a word until the door is firmly closed behind him. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know,&quot; he asks, &quot;that it--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Merlin tangles his hands in his hair, turning around in panicked circles. &quot;No, I didn't know! I thought--I would never--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; Arthur starts pacing. A month. A month. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And yet...as angry and frustrated as he'd like to be right now, he really can't summon that much ire towards the whole thing. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's been a nice month. A month of having Merlin by his side, unwavering, always there for him. A month of always having someone to talk with, mutter to out of the corner of his mouth, confide him. A month of having a warm body next to him when he wakes up. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A month of Merlin. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin,&quot; he says finally, causing both of them to halt in their tracks, &quot;I've...I've enjoyed this past month.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He looks up slowly, wary of trying to push too hard, especially when they're both keyed up like this, but Merlin's looking at him with hope in his eyes and he swallows his fear. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I wouldn't be opposed to continuing like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There's a moment of silence. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...er, I wouldn't be either,&quot; Merlin stutters. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall we, er--&quot;Arthur waves toward the bed-- &quot;make ready to sleep?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Merlin says in a rush, &quot;just let me--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now that I know I'm not about to drag you across the castle,&quot; Merlin says, already halfway to the door, &quot;I can get my own nightclothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be ridiculous, Merlin,&quot; Arthur says, &quot;you can keep using mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but--&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; Arthur says, &quot;it's no trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin pauses, his hand on the door. &quot;Arthur, do you...do you like seeing me in your nightclothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now it's Arthur's turn to flush bright red. &quot;...maybe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He braces for the teasing he knows is about to come but it doesn't. Merlin simply goes to the wardrobe and selects a nightshirt. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Just like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your clothes are all fancy, why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going to tease me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not right now,&quot; Merlin shrugs, &quot;I've got lots of opportunities in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur sees through the cheeky smile to the worry still hovering behind Merlin's eyes. So Arthur gives him a fond smile in return. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you do.&quot; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sliding into bed is easy, as is pulling Merlin into his arms. Merlin settles instinctively, until he tenses. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You, er, you know you don't have to do this.&quot; He tries for carefree but it's not working. &quot;I'm not about to yank you awake if I fall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Arthur lifts his chin gently. &quot;Are you still afraid of the dark?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin's cheeks burn but he nods. Arthur smiles. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then shh and sleep. I'll be right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He tries not to grin when Merlin nods off in his arms not a few moments later. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In the morning, when they wake, Arthur goes to roll out of bed to get their breakfast called up. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He still instantly, looking back to see Merlin blinking his eyes open lazily, reaching out for Arthur's warmth. And oh he looks so soft in the morning light, and Arthur wants to cuddle him back into his chest and stay there, letting the sun reach its golden fingers through the window, lull them both back to sleep. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;...don't pull away...&quot; Merlin's voice, thick with sleep, coaxes Arthur back. &quot;...not just yet...&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sleepy,&quot; Arthur teases gently, scooping Merlin back up, &quot;think you're going to fall back under?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;'S not dark,&quot; Merlin slurs, &quot;it'll be easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still want me to hold you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Merlin nods, spindly fingers clutching him tightly. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you big softie,&quot; Arthur mumbles, already falling back asleep himself, &quot;you go on back to sleep. I'll be here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As he drifts off, he smiles. This is really nice, having Merlin here like this. Maybe...maybe after a little while longer of this, Merlin will feel comfortable enough to tell him he's a sorcerer too. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Honestly, did he really think Arthur hasn't noticed?</td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">Ever since they'd been trapped in the Upside Down together, fighting for their lives and not knowing if or when they were going to die, Steve and Eddie have gotten inexplicably closer.<br />
<br />
What can they say, trauma really speeds up the friendship process. Gets rid of pesky thoughts like 'we're from different worlds!' when an actual real 'other world' is there, and you're trapped in it.<br />
<br />
They've been hanging out more and more lately, on weeknights after Steve's shifts at Family Video he'll head over to Eddie's trailer - to the sound raucous and gleeful teasing from Robin - and they'll spend the nights talking and listening to Eddie's records. He's taken it upon himself to introduce Steve to 'real music' after Steve had went &quot;Who?&quot; to Ozzy goddamn Osbourne.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;On weekends Eddie will come over to Steve's big, empty house and help him fill the otherwise suffocating silence with movies and beer. Tonight's one of those nights, and Eddie's brought nail polish with him.<br />
<br />
Steve isn't sure about it at first, but after a few cold ones, and some prodding from Eddie, he agrees. Eddie doesn't waste any time before taking his hand and starting to paint, his strokes are firm, neat. He's obviously done this before. Steve can barely focus on anything other than the foreign warmth on his hand.<br />
<br />
Eddie's done after around ten minutes and when he pulls his hands away, Steve mourns the loss. He tells Steve to stay put and wait for his nails to dry before getting up to grab another beer. With little else to do, Steve notices the bandana hanging out of his back pocket. <br />
<br />
He wonders about it, for a bit. And when Eddie gets back from the kitchen, he asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that for?&quot; Eddie settles back into the couch, pressing a hard line of heat against Steve's shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's what for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The bandana in your back pocket. What's it for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie pauses, looks over at him and raises a pointed eyebrow. He shifts, turning his body towards Steve's, pulling away in the process. Steve kind of misses the warmth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you wanna know? And how do you know it's even for something, maybe I just like the way it looks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve flushes at the oversight. &quot;Oh, uh yeah. I guess that could be it, too.&quot; A moment passes, Eddie watches him struggle to come up with a better retort. It's kind of cute actually, the way his expression pinches, as if he's dedicated all of his brainpower to this one task.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, but I just thought it was a little strange to put it there all unsecured, unless it was like, for something y'know. Like for your hair maybe?&quot; Eddie gives him a look, &quot;Or, I dunno, fuckin' committing crime?&quot; He tries to amend.<br />
<br />
Eddie laughs, amused and ever so slightly endeared, &quot;Committing crime? Harrington you are one hell of a trip. Praytell, what crimes would I be committing with a bandana.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve's brows furrow, &quot;Fuck if I know? Arson? You look like the type.&quot; Eddie smiles, what a dumb jock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y'know for someone who survived an evil alternate reality with me, you don't remember much do you? Like we've been over this, I'm no delinquent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve makes a pfft noise, tone mocking, &quot;Well I've been hit in the head so many times I'm pretty sure my short-term memory is permanently shot. So... you can't get mad at me for that. Legally.&quot; Eddie rolls his eyes, but lets the subject drop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, alright. Anyways back to your question: it's a signal to the other freaks out there. Tells them something important.&quot;<br />
<br />
What an incredibly vague answer. Steve stares at him, incredulous, and flails his hands around in exasperation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, what does it tell them?&quot; He's got that wide-eyed, sort of frantic look about him. The one he usually gets around the kids when they're trying something especially dangerous. It brings out his dimples, Eddie notices.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... You're not a freak, are you?&quot; He prods, leaning towards Steve - who, predictably, just stares open-mouthed. Eddie chuckles. &quot;Then you'll just have to be ok not knowing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve glares, presses his lips into a thin line, and blows a raspberry. What a cop out!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now I'm all curious! You can't just not tell me. Promise I won't tell.&quot; Eddie raises a skeptical eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear! Not even Robin!&quot; And, well, Eddie figures what the hell. He's already this invested and if surviving Vecna with him has taught him anything it's that Steve Harrington is a stubborn bastard. He won't stop asking until Eddie gives him something.<br />
<br />
He sighs. Steve grins, knowing he's won, and sits back, smug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, you asked for this.&quot; Eddie pulls the bandana from his pocket, brandishing it out in front of him. They take a moment to stare at the object.<br />
<br />
He takes a deep breath before deciding, fuck it- if we can survive a telekinetic serial killer together, we can survive this- and diving right in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Different colors mean different things, for these bandanas. For example, if I had a bright pink one it'd mean I'm into spanking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve makes a choked-off noise and doubles over, &quot;Sorry- what?&quot; Eddie smiles and tilts his head, &quot;No need to apologize, I'll say it again. If I had a fuchsia one, it'd mean I get off on spanking.&quot;<br />
<br />
For a moment Steve is stunned into silence, staring wide-eyed at his friend in disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... When you said freaks you meant it. What- you guys are just walking around with your bedroom preferences all on display like that? Isn't it embarrassing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're called kinks, Harrington. And no, not really. The only ones who know what it means, are just as freaky as I am, everyone else thinks it's just a fashion statement.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve nods, considering.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's fair I guess.&quot; He pauses for a moment, cringes to himself, and continues, &quot;I almost don't wanna ask but I also kind of really wanna know. What does black mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie levels a glare at him, Steve shrugs. &quot;I asked what it's for and you haven't answered!&quot; Eddie sighs and runs a hand through his hair. Steve wonders if he conditions. His hair is really shiny, probably soft, too.<br />
<br />
Eddie's voice cuts through his thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;It means I'm into something called S&amp;M, ever heard of it?&quot; Steve shakes his head, no. It sounds like that game Dustin plays.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it like that complicated game you and the kids play? D&amp;D, I think? But like the adult version where it's like a sex thing. Like instead of a regular dungeon master you're a sex dungeon master, which, makes a whole lot more sense cuz like-&quot; Eddie kind of wants to smack him. Almost wants to kiss him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, dipshit. It's an acronym, stands for sadism and masochism.&quot; At Steve's blank look, he continues, &quot;Which means I get off on making it hurt a little for my partner when we're in the sack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve cocks his head to the side, brows drawn, &quot;Making it hurt? But isn't that like, no fun at all for your partner?&quot; He doesn't say girl, because Eddie hadn't. Something in his stomach swoops.<br />
<br />
Eddie chuckles but shakes his head, &quot;Not necessarily, some people are into it- that's what 'masochism' means. And I always check, don't worry. Consent is always the first priority.&quot;<br />
<br />
There's a moment of thoughtful silence as Steve grapples with all of this new information.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.&quot; A thought crosses his mind. More of a memory really, hazy with blood loss and adrenaline, but it's there.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the Upside Down, when Nancy was patching me up...&quot; Eddie nods, very slightly, he has the decency to look sheepish, at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say, Harrington? You were whining, whimpering, begging her to keep going. To get it over with. Who could've ignored that?&quot; Steve is very warm right now. The way Eddie's talking, the way he's describing it is so... hot. When the actual event had been anything but.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve.&quot; He mutters. Eddie looks up at him from where he'd been picking at his nails.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just Steve. M' kind of sick of being called 'Harrington'.&quot; His eyes flick towards Eddie's and Jesus, those doe eyes are gonna be the death of him.<br />
<br />
But Eddie nods, real slow, and just looks at him for a second. &quot;Ok Steve,&quot; his words come out like molasses, &quot;feel free to tell me to fuck off if I'm reading this wrong, but did you wanna try something with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve freezes up, he's interested, no denying that. Not after the week of panicking and calling Robin at ungodly hours of the night to ask her stupid, insensitive questions, until finally realizing. It's just...<br />
<br />
He looks down, a little embarrassed after everything he just learned, &quot;I don't think I like getting slapped around in bed,&quot; he chuckles, derisive, &quot;god knows I get enough of that in real life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie's expression softens, he brings a hand up to cup Steve's shoulder, gentle.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's fine, Steve, I wasn't going to suggest that anyway. It'd be way too much, too fast.&quot; He takes a breath and holds out the bandana, &quot;How do you feel about blindfolds?&quot;<br />
<br />
And, to be very honest, Steve doesn't really feel any which way about blindfolds. He doesn't really understand what, exactly, they could add to the bedroom experience, but he's willing to try anything if it means Eddie will touch him.<br />
<br />
He decides on, &quot;Dunno, never tried them before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie hums, considering. &quot;Alright I can work with that. Do you have a safeword in mind?&quot; At the look on Steve's face he continues, &quot;A safeword is a word that will immediately stop what's happening. If you ever feel bad or unsafe, you just say the safeword and I stop. Promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Steve thinks that's a great idea, having a word that will end whatever's happening if someone isn't having fun. It makes him relax a little, secure in the knowledge that Eddie won't hurt him. That he doesn't want to, unless Steve wants him to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, um... is peaches okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie snorts, endeared, &quot;Yeah, sweetheart, peaches is ok. So, if and when you say 'peaches' I'll stop. I want you to practice a few times for me.&quot; The pet name makes everything go fuzzy for a second, Steve shakes himself out of it. That was weird.<br />
<br />
At Eddie's imploring look, Steve mutters. &quot;Peaches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again.&quot; His thumb starts sweeping towards Steve's collarbone, he shivers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peaches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One more time, please.&quot; The words are soft, kind. Steve really likes the way Eddie's smooth voice fits around them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peaches.&quot; He breathes. Eddie smiles at him, squeezing his shoulder before letting go.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect, thank you. Ok, I know this is a lot, we've been moving pretty fast and although you seem fine now, I'm sure that can change at any time. Use your word if you need a break, even if it's just to slow down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve nods, and with a look from Eddie vocalizes the affirmative.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy.&quot; Something molten hot pools in his stomach, punches a breath out of him. Eddie chuckles.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that's my next point, is there anything you like to be called? Anything you don't?&quot; He gives Steve a moment to collect himself, patient. A lock of hair falls from his coif.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing... mean? Sorry if you're into that, but I really don't like it.&quot; Eddie hums and brushes the hair from his face. His hand stays cupping Steve's jaw. The rings on his fingers are cool against his cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's fine, baby, I can be nice. Just tell me if you don't like something, okay?&quot; He nods, Eddie decides not to push for words this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I'm gonna put the blindfold on now. Then, I'm going to touch you, if you don't like something, what do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve swallows, shudders, &quot;Peaches.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie smiles, gently pats his cheek, and turns to grab the bandana. &quot;Good.&quot; Steve has to physically stop himself from whining. What is up with him today, why does this feel so... intense?<br />
<br />
Before he can properly analyze the situation, Eddie is fitting the blindfold around his head. &quot;Not too tight?&quot; He asks, Steve can't tell exactly where he is, but shakes his head in the general direction of his voice. Eddie chuckles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect, can I take your shirt off?&quot; Steve's mouth is suspiciously dry, &quot;Sure,&quot; he rasps, feeling incredibly warm. Maybe this will help him cool down.<br />
<br />
The moment Eddie's hands touch his skin, sliding under his shirt to skate across his stomach, the thought flies out the window. Now he's even warmer than before.<br />
<br />
One of his hands eventually finds its way to the small of his back, the other starts pushing his shirt up. Steve can feel his breath against his ear as he speaks, &quot;You're so beautiful, sweetheart. Ever since that night at the lake, I haven't been able to stop thinking about your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve gasps, shivers when Eddie flicks a nipple. He chuckles, tugs at one of his sleeves, &quot;Arm please, love.&quot; The air is hot, muggy around them. Steve complies, raises his arm and lets Eddie help him out of the sleeve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, very good. And the other?&quot; Steve doesn't hesitate this time, Eddie's hands are warm, addicting against his skin. &quot;Thank you, sweetheart, now duck your head for me?&quot; All of these instructions, the gentle direction makes something in Steve's head spin. He wonders if Eddie knew this would happen, if he planned on it.<br />
<br />
The shirt comes off easily, and the cool air of his house cuts across his skin. Something's wrong, the thought pops into his mind, unprompted, he's not... here anymore. His thoughts are muddled, he feels drunk. He feels like he did underneath the mall, tied up in a lab - hazy, scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peaches!&quot; He gasps. There's a soft thud as Eddie drops his shirt and rushes over, thumbing the blindfold away from Steve's eyes. &quot;Hey, hey. What's wrong? What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve is still gasping, trying to get air into his lungs, but being able to see Eddie, reassure himself he's not there. It's comforting.<br />
<br />
Eddie seems to understand, rubs his back as he gets himself back together. After a few minutes, his breaths slow, quieten. &quot;Sorry.&quot; He mumbles, leaning into Eddie's space. The other boy immediately makes room, wraps an arm around his shoulder and kisses his hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing to be sorry about, love.&quot; He pauses, rubs a hand up Steve's back, &quot;Wanna tell me what happened?&quot; Steve breathes, slow in, slow out, and nods against his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno, everything felt all fuzzy. Thought I was drugged again.&quot; Eddie hums, squeezes him against himself. He's got questions, but they can wait.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like you were enjoying yourself a little too much, a little too fast. S' not your fault, but it can cause a spike of adrenaline that'll have you feeling fuzzy like that for a while.&quot; He pauses, considering, &quot;The blindfold probably didn't help, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve shakes his head, no, it wasn't that, &quot;No, that part was okay, they didn't blindfold me.&quot; He stops, swallows, &quot;I was cold. You weren't there anymore.&quot; He remembers the absence of heat, the way the air conditioning had raised goosebumps on his skin as Eddie dealt with his shirt. He didn't like it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you wanna stop?&quot; Eddie thinks it's probably best to check in now, while he's coherent enough to respond. Steve shakes his head, says, &quot;No.&quot; when prompted for a verbal answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright... How about this, I keep in physical contact with you the whole time. I won't leave you again, promise.&quot; He grins, wolfish, &quot;Not like it'll be hard, I don't think I could keep my hands off you if I tried.&quot; Steve chuckles, bats halfheartedly at Eddie's chest before pushing himself up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok I get it, Mr. 'I can't stop thinking about your body.'&quot; Eddie laughs and follows him up, steadying. &quot;It's true! You threw your shirt at me! How could I possibly ignore that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The air isn't quite as heavy now, Steve notices. He takes another deep breath and smiles, nodding at Eddie. &quot;Okay, I think I'm good now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie pushes Steve's hair from his forehead, pressing a kiss there and smiling against him. &quot;You tell me if you're not, okay? You did a good job this time, keep it up.&quot; Steve hums an agreement, settling back against the couch.<br />
<br />
They share a tender look before Eddie pulls the blindfold down again, pressing kisses to where Steve's eyes are under the fabric. Steve bites his lip to keep from grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, sweetheart, can I get your pants, now?&quot; He nods, reaching down to try and fumble with his belt himself. Eddie grabs his hand and guides it to the side, &quot;Let me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve's eyes are wide beneath the blindfold, his whole body tenses as Eddie deftly works the belt off in three smooth movements, a soft clink somewhere to the left indicates he's thrown it to the side.<br />
<br />
Sensing his anticipation, Eddie drifts a hand across Steve's taught stomach, the muscles tremble under his touch. &quot;Relax, love, I'll take care of you.&quot; Steve is so very warm.<br />
<br />
His pants come off slightly less easily than the belt, first, Eddie has to get it off of his hips - the way he mutters &quot;ass up, please.&quot; is going to haunt Steve's dreams for years - then, he has to tug it from his thighs. The fabric drags against the sensitive skin, the feeling so much more intense than usual, Eddie's hands follow not long after. Steve shakes. It's so much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too much?&quot; Eddie asks, smoothing a hand against his hip.<br />
<br />
Steve whines. &quot;Nope, no. I'm hhh, I'm good.&quot; Eddie chuckles, pulling his pants the rest of the way off and pressing a kiss to his stomach on the way down. The muscles spasm at his unexpected touch, Steve's head falls back into a gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
There's definitely a wet spot in his underwear, at this point. He's kind of glad for the blindfold, now, because it means he doesn't have to look at the embarrassing... situation.. building in his boxers.<br />
<br />
Eddie isn't put off, though. He drags his fingers lightly against his front, rings sometimes catching and making Steve groan. &quot;Eh- fuck- Eddie, c'mon man hhh please!&quot;<br />
<br />
He watches, entranced as Steve fucking Harrington falls apart on his own couch. Whining and pleading. A thought crosses his mind, it's a little condescending, but not mean. He decides to chance it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never thought you'd be so easy, love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seems he had nothing to worry about as Steve practically keens, &quot;Nothin' - ngh - nothin' wrong with liking a little touching, right? Fuuck&quot; Eddie smooths his sweaty hair back, smiling, &quot;Nothing wrong, indeed.&quot;<br />
<br />
He wonders if Steve could come like this, he thinks he really wants to find out. Judging from the army-sized tent in his boxers, he's pretty close already.<br />
<br />
Eddie runs a finger along the line of Steve's length, leaning forward into his space. Steve is so, incredibly warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you come like this?&quot; He whispers, breath fanning across Steve's ear. He shakes, nods his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, fuck, probably.&quot; Eddie grins, leaning in to mouth against his neck. Steve can't see anything, but he can feel everything. He's surrounded by heat, surrounded by Eddie. The hard line of his body against his, his soft lips against his neck, his words filling the air, filling his thoughts. It's dizzying.<br />
<br />
A sharp bite sends waves of heat to Steve's core, he moans softly. Eddie mouths his way back to his ear, catching the lobe in his teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you need, sweetheart?&quot; Steve gasps a few times, trying to catch his breath. His hands come up to tug at his own hair. Eddie watches, entranced, feeling Steve's frantic heartbeat under his hand. He did that. It's dizzying.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno, I dunno. I'm so close-&quot; Eddie reaches down, cups him through his boxers and squeezes.<br />
<br />
Steve shouts, thighs pressing around Eddie's hips as he shakes apart. He leans up into his touch, mouth parted around stuttered out moans. Eddie keeps his hand where it is, feels Steve twitch as he makes a mess of his underwear. He'll probably dream about this for months.<br />
<br />
Eddie gives him a few seconds, then pulls his hand away and wipes it against his jeans. Steve whines at the loss of warmth, arm settled across the blindfold as he catches his breath.<br />
<br />
Eddie watches his body come down, the way his heaving chest settles, how the tension bleeds out of him as the minutes tick by. It's beautiful. He can't help but want to touch.<br />
<br />
Reaching out, he swipes his palm up Steve's side comfortingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good?&quot; He asks, drawing into his space. Steve laughs, breathless, and nods.<br />
<br />
Eddie reaches for the blindfold, cups the back of his head as he unties it. When the cloth falls away, Steve looks up at him, eyes wide and wet. Eddie's cock gives a valiant twitch in his pants, but he pushes the arousal down. Fuck. He did that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, great, dude. Fuck.&quot; Eddie cringes at the term.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just got you off, don't call me 'dude'.&quot; Steve grins tiredly up at him, Eddie likes the expression on him. &quot;My bad, Edward.&quot; Nope. Not that one either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nevermind.&quot; Eddie sighs, exasperated. If even a thorough working over won't shut Steve up, he doesn't know what will.<br />
<br />
A moment passes before Steve's grin falls, brows drawing in concern, &quot;Wait. What about you?&quot; Eddie smooths a hand down his bare thigh, &quot;What about me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve glares, &quot;You didn't get to... Y'know.&quot; Eddie raises his eyebrows, smiling at his shyness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was literally just touching your dick and you can't say 'come'? Steven.&quot; Steve goes to protest, but Eddie laughs and rests a palm on his stomach, &quot;Relax, sweetheart. I got what I wanted out of that, believe me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve kind of wants to protest, because, um, he's still fully clothed? How was that fun for him? But he decides to let it be. Eddie's been right about everything else so far. &quot;Alright...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie smiles and snaps the band of Steve's boxers against his skin, &quot;Good. Now, these are filthy. I'm gonna go grab you something to change into, why don't you get out of these for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
And yeah, Steve can do that, so he hums an affirmative as Eddie makes his way upstairs. It's a bit of a struggle, but he's able to shimmy his way out of them by the time Eddie gets back, holding a red pair of boxers in one hand, and one of his own shirts in the other. He's grinning.<br />
<br />
Steve flushes, he thought he'd hidden those better. It's not his fault it's always raining when he goes over to Eddie's, and that the other boy is extremely generous when it comes to lending clothes. He never asks for the shirts back. Never. So Steve just... hadn't returned them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie chuckles. &quot;I didn't say anything! I see you have very good taste, though.&quot; He holds up the shirt, it says 'Black Sabbath'. Steve vaguely remembers them being a band, he couldn't name a single song by them, though. He grunts and rolls his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever. Gimme the goods.&quot; He reaches for the clothes. Eddie makes no move to hand them over. He just looks at him. &quot;Just a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that Eddie practically runs to the kitchen. Before Steve can even wonder what the hell just happened, he's back, damp washcloth in hand. He kneels in front of the couch, looks at Steve through his own curly bangs, and asks, &quot;May I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve swallows, nods, although not really understanding what the other boy is asking for. He doesn't have a lot of time to speculate before Eddie's swiping the washcloth between his legs, gently cleaning the area. It feels weirdly nice, the intimacy of it.<br />
<br />
A few minutes pass in silence, and then he's done, pressing a kiss to Steve's hip and standing back up. &quot;That's better, now here.&quot; He tosses the clothes into Steve's lap and heads back towards the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm gonna get us some snacks, what do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve thinks this 'crush' might be worse than he thought.  </td>

            <td class="column21 style0 s">As soon as Hermione got to her room after the Opening Feast, she saw that her pajamas were already laid out - probably by a house-elf. Hermione glared at them before digging into her trunk. Finally finding her copy of Hogwarts, A History, she grabbed it and then changed quickly before crawling into her bed and spelling the curtains shut. She was quite certain that it had never mentioned House-elves before, though she did have a vague recollection of the Triwizard Tournament appearing somewhere. She'd look for both here before heading to the library tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Tapping Hogwarts, A History with her wand, Hermione muttered &quot;sciscito house-elf&quot;. Immediately two bookmarks appeared in the text, a function of the searching charm. Surprised that she had missed these references before, Hermione opened to the first marker, which was near the beginning, in the chapter on the founding.<br />
<br />
Skimming the marked page, Hermione finally found it: 'Rowena, coming from a wealthy family, provided the first lot of elves for the castle.' Well that explained her missing it before: it was lacking the 'house' modifier. Hermione now remembered that she had assumed something closer to Tolkien elves, the same way there were centaurs in the forest.<br />
<br />
Annoyed, but suspecting that the second reference would be as useless, Hermione flipped to the second marker. As she flipped the last page, her hand froze. There, tucked between the pages, was a neatly folded piece of printer paper, just like the ones she had gotten from her parents' dental office. Hermione found her hand shaking slightly, and she angrily clenched it around her book.<br />
<br />
Last year, when she had been given the Time Turner, Hermione had come up with this as a way to pass messages to herself. She knew that none of her roommates could be bothered to look at Hogwarts, A History, except for Alice, who had her own copy, nor could Ron or Harry. And someone wizardingborn who might figure out what she was doing wouldn't have access to anything but parchment. It was a way for her to leave messages to herself if necessary, without fear of someone else catching on.<br />
<br />
But Hermione had given back the Time Turner at the end of last year after that fiasco with Sirius Black and the Minister. There was absolutely no reason for a piece of printer paper to be resting here in her copy of Hogwarts, A History. None whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Hermione cautiously slipped the paper out of the book and unfolded it. It felt a bit smoother than the paper she currently had in her trunk, and was possibly a little brighter white, though that was hard to tell when contrasting with the off-white parchment of the book. Inside, in her own handwriting, it said:<br />
<br />
<br />
You have cultural attribution bias. First, read Elvish Cultures by Terrence Hawking and after that call for Dobby. Don't harangue Harry about it. As soon as possible, ask Moody about detection charms. Don't drink the pumpkin juice.<br />
<br />
<br />
It wasn't the most cryptic note ever, though there were certainly plenty of details Hermione would like to have clarified. The real question, though, was whether she trusted her own future self enough to take this advice. And she did.<br />
<br />
Hermione added the book to her 'to research' list in her planner, and then made a note to stay after the first Defense class and ask Professor Moody about detection charms. She would also look them up in the library, but the note had been clear that she should start with the Professor.<br />
<br />
oOo<br />
<br />
Elvish Cultures hadn't been in the library when she checked at lunch, so Hermione had to owl-order it from Flourish and Blotts. While she waited for it to arrive, she had checked out a few books about the Triwizard Tournament. There were a few that looked like they might mention house-elves, but Hermione had learned from the Lockhart fiasco that not all books were accurate. If her future self was directing her at a specific book, she would wait for that one before forming her opinion. There were no books specifically on detection spells, so she decided to wait and see what Professor Moody recommended.<br />
<br />
From listening around at breakfast, she had discovered that the Gryffindor sixth years had Defence on Mondays before dinner, and if she hurried from Arithmancy, she could hopefully make it to the classroom before Professor Moody left.<br />
<br />
Hermione was halfway down the stairs when she heard Harry call her name. She waved at him over her shoulder, but kept up her power walk to the Defense corridor. Just as she reached the classroom, Harry grabbed her arm. He was panting lightly; apparently he had run a bit to keep up with her. &quot;Bloody hell, Hermione,&quot; he protested mildly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to ask a question,&quot; Hermione explained, tugging open the classroom door. &quot;Professor Moody?&quot; she called.<br />
<br />
He wasn't visible, but she heard him grunt and then call &quot;In a minute!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione glanced behind Harry as she entered the classroom, but he was alone. &quot;Where's Ron?&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
Harry raised his eyebrow at her, clearly conveying his opinion of the question. Hermione sighed. &quot;Dinner, of course.&quot; She should have known better than to ask. This mystery note had her rattled.<br />
<br />
Professor Moody emerged from his office into the classroom, as Hermione was pulling out her notebook and pen. &quot;I haven't had your lot yet,&quot; he said gruffly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven't,&quot; Hermione agreed quickly. &quot;I'm Hermione Granger, and this is Harry Potter.&quot; Professor Moody looked a little surprised at that, but she had gotten used to that reaction over the last few years with Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I noticed that you seemed to use detection charms at meals,&quot; Hermione said. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Harry perk up at the topic. &quot;I was hoping that you could teach them to me, or tell me where to look them up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea!&quot; Moody declared. &quot;You can never be too careful! It would be a good thing for you to learn too, Potter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Harry said politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are three classes of detection charms,&quot; Moody launched into a lecture, and Hermione hastened to take notes; she slid over to the closest desk so she didn't have to balance her notebook in her hand. &quot;Detecting people and creatures, detecting spell work, and detecting potions work. There's medical ones too, but those aren't relevant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry perched on the seat beside her, and Hermione gave a slight nod to tell him that she would share these notes later. His tension eased slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Detecting people and creatures starts at OWL level, but you could look it up early. Your standard textbook for that year is a good place to start. Charms're NEWT level, for the most part. You need to know what kind of charms you're looking for, and that's advanced stuff. You could probably learn to cast the spell, but the readings it gave would be meaningless until you had that grounding in distinguishing charm forms and signatures to be able to wade through the results.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione nodded as she noted that; it made perfect sense that casting the spell and interpreting the spell would be two different things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of your curse breakers start with charms detection. If you're good at it, and good at unraveling their arithmancy, you can move to breaking 'em. Wards follow the same patterns, so knowing one is almost the same as knowing the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, detecting potions is a different field, even though that also isn't taught until NEWT level. However, for your purposes, it isn't hard to learn. You don't have to know who made it, or who gave it to you. You only need to know what potion you're looking for. Memorize the incantations and the standard charts of reactions and you're ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where would we find those charts?&quot; Harry asked, surprising Hermione that he seemed quite interested in the topic.<br />
<br />
&quot;NEWT level defense texts should have them; so should your potions text,&quot; Professor Moody said, stroking his chin. &quot;Your standard Potions text from this year should have the information too. It only takes a few seconds for a competent potions teacher to tell you the key color or trait of a potion as you're making it, so you can pick these things up as you go. Course, you lot've got Snape, so I'm sure he's never mentioned it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry grinned, and Hermione suppressed one of her own. She knew Professor Snape was a horrible teacher, but it went against her grain to insult a teacher so openly. Harry had taunted her once that if she was willing to set the man on fire, she should be willing to admit aloud that he was a git, but she couldn't quite bring herself to agree.<br />
<br />
&quot;The spells themselves don't require any degree of power,&quot; Professor Moody continued. &quot;The motion for the first is a slight jab and the second's a wave. You can chain them together, once you have each one down pat.&quot;<br />
<br />
So saying, he pulled out his wand. &quot;First for testing liquids, the jab,&quot; he demonstrated, &quot;and say 'Pepurigoso'.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione and Harry drew their wands together and copied him. The jab was barely a poke, and they both pronounced the spell properly on the first try.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. It's got about a meter radius, but that only works if you can see inside the container the liquid is in. So if you're sitting together, you could do it once for both cups, but you probably couldn't see into the cup of the person four down, even if it would analyze it. Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Hermione said, jotting that down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now that works for liquids of any size, in theory. A barrel, a puddle, whatever. The hitch comes in when your body of water is considerably bigger than the spell range. For example, you could stand at the edge of the Black Lake and cast that. If I had dumped a potion in the middle of the lake, it would be so far away from you that you couldn't detect it. Even if I was only a few meters away, it would probably dilute so quickly that you still couldn't detect it. Now, if the whole lake was tainted by something, like litres and litres dumped into it, the spell would work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione nodded again. That fit with what she remembered about dilution and comparative ratios from her science classes before Hogwarts.<br />
<br />
Professor Moody continued. &quot;Now, the second one you'll've seen me use for food: just wave over whatever you want to check. It also has a range of about a meter, but it gets fuzzy beyond the reach of your arm and wand. The incantation is Ostendo. There's a food specific addendum, Alimentus. Without it, the more general version works on just about anything: clothing, tables, what have you. The food addition narrows it down to the kinds of potions you'd find in food. You don't expect a hair smoothing potion in your food, for example. It wouldn't poison you either, and there's no reason for it. The food addendum narrows the search field, which means you can miss things, but it is easier to memorize the smaller list of results.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do these detect poisons as well?&quot; Harry asked.<br />
<br />
Professor Moody looked pleased at the question. &quot;In a way. If it is a known potions ingredient, venom, or toxin, then yes. Otherwise? Possibly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Muggle chemicals?&quot; Hermione asked. She knew that most wizards weren't familiar with such things, but for someone as paranoid as the Professor appeared to be, he was quite certain that he had also looked into such things. And if not, he likely soon will.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd be surprised how many muggle chemicals are actually identifiable by it,&quot; Moody said with a small chuckle. Harry looked slightly surprised, but Hermione wasn't. &quot;There are some things, chemicals they invent...&quot; he trailed off, thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lab synthesized,&quot; Hermione quickly supplied.<br />
<br />
&quot;It won't pick those up,&quot; Moody agreed, nodding. &quot;But anything natural? More than likely.&quot;<br />
<br />
It probably also wouldn't detect radiation, Hermione reasoned. Not that she suspected to need to detect radiation with magic any time soon. But it was worth jotting a note to investigate some day. Perhaps she could invent one if none existed. So thinking, she jotted the note to the side, where she could later remove it to her idea notebook.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you two try it, the general first and then the food one,&quot; Moody instructed.<br />
<br />
Harry still had his wand in hand, while Hermione had put hers down to write, so he went first. Professor Moody had to slightly correct his pronunciation of Alimentus - his emphasis was on the third syllable instead of the second, but other than that he achieved it. Hermione followed his example and got them perfectly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good!&quot; Moody declared. &quot;Now take something simple you've got on hand and dump it in a cup of water and on some snack. Test it until you can actually get the results correct. Then you'll be good to go. Now, off to dinner with you,&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione and Harry quickly thanked the Professor and he nodded before stomping out the door to his office. <br />
<br />
Hermione quickly tucked her notebook back into her bag, and Harry courteously held the classroom door open for her to precede him. &quot;So, you think we'll need to know that?&quot; Harry asked conversationally as they walked down the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure,&quot; Hermione said, nibbling her lip. Her note to herself had indicated it was necessary, but she couldn't exactly tell Harry that. &quot;I know that over the summer, the twins mentioned something in passing about pranking food, and after seeing the Professor testing his own food... I just thought it might be useful to learn.&quot; All true statements, just slightly obfuscating her real motivation.<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes sense,&quot; Harry agreed. &quot;So we need to check out a potions book to find out what we detect, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione nodded. &quot;Yes, but that isn't crucial at this juncture. I would place testing above analysis; better that we know that something is in our drink, rather than knowing exactly what that something is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Harry nodded his understanding. &quot;So at dinner, wanna test it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione considered it, then shook her head. &quot;We should wait until later. First off, we don't want people seeing us practicing and asking what we're doing. That would give them the idea to find a different way to dose us. Second of all, though he taught us the words, you can see that Professor Moody casts it silently, without speaking or even mouthing the words. If we can get to that stage, or at least to the point where we're barely muttering, then that will make it harder to tell what we're doing, or even that we're doing anything. Second of all, we need something to put onto the plate or into the goblet. Without a potion, there's no way to tell we're doing it right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry nodded agreeably. &quot;Right. So after dinner? I can nick something now, and then we could find an empty classroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really want to learn this right away,&quot; Hermione mused, pleasantly surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last year, when we were in the infirmary and Snape and the Minister came rushing in?&quot; he asked. Hermione nodded to show she knew what he was talking about. &quot;They mentioned Veritaserum. I asked Percy, and he said it was a truth serum. I know enough from Muggle - normal - movies and telly to know that's usually a liquid that goes in your water or something. And the way Snape's glaring at me again, I wouldn't put it past him.&quot; Harry explained.<br />
<br />
Hermione was tempted to remind Harry that the Headmaster trusted Professor Snape, and that he probably wouldn't hurt them, but she reconsidered. His glares at Harry this year had been worse than last year, and there was a difference between trusting someone with your life and trusting them with your secrets. Case in point, herself and Harry. She trusted Professor Snape not to kill Harry, at least once their first year had been explained, but she didn't necessarily trust him not to slip Harry a truth serum and ask him all kinds of humiliating things.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's very well reasoned, Harry,&quot; she said instead. If he was truly serious about learning this, then that was a second person she could trust to check things for her. And if they did find something, as the presence of her future note implied, she would have someone she could talk to who would understand how she had found out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll check out those potions books after dinner, so we can check that we're getting the right color indicators as well.&quot; Hermione decided.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should we invite Ron?&quot; Harry asked, as they turned the last corner to the Great Hall.<br />
<br />
Hermione considered that. &quot;We could, but I have two reasons not to,&quot;<br />
<br />
Ron would have jumped in angrily, but Harry just looked at her expectantly. &quot;First of all, we don't want to advertise that we're searching for potions in our food and drink just yet, in case that tips off someone like Professor Snape. Ron has a tendency to speak without thinking, and he's not subtle in his wandwork.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry nodded his agreement to the first point, so Hermione pressed on. &quot;Second, if the twins are planning to potion our food or drink, we don't want them tipped off either, and you know Ron can't lie to them convincingly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry snorted. &quot;No he can't,&quot; he agreed. &quot;He'd probably also be horrified to learn something that won't be on a test,&quot; he grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is that,&quot; Hermione said, pursing her lips. She honestly did not understand Ron's overblown laziness. She had given this a lot of thought over the last few years, and come to no logical conclusions. She had eventually filed it into her mental index under &quot;things about Ronald Wealsey that make no sense&quot; and done her best to forget about it.<br />
<br />
They reached the Great Hall only ten minutes late, and found that Ron appeared to already be on his second helping. He had saved them two seats, at least, and Hermione allowed Harry to sit first so she wouldn't have to watch Ron shovel food into his mouth.<br />
<br />
Sparing a small regret that they hadn't mastered the spells yet, Hermione stuck to water instead of risking the pumpkin juice. She wasn't sure if he was copying her or feeling his own sense of unease after their lesson, but Harry did the same.<br />
<br />
The meal seemed to crawl, but finally dinner was over. Harry and Hermione had eaten slightly less than usual, but were still finished long before Ron, as normal. Fortunately, it gave them a chance to slip away without needing an excuse. Harry had also pocketed some dinner rolls to test. &quot;See you later,&quot; Harry offered, and Ron simply waved without taking his eyes from his plate.<br />
<br />
Sighing at his gluttony, Hermione dragged Harry down the Transfiguration corridor, where she pointed to the empty classroom at the end. She had hidden here more than once in her first year, under the reasoning that few people would want to pass the classroom and office of Professor McGonagall just to come taunt her. It had also provided a good transition space last year when she was using the Time Turner.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll grab some potions from my trunk, and fetch the library books,&quot; Hermione explained. &quot;You go get some water from the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry nodded, but then looked worried. &quot;You can't do the cup transfiguration yet?&quot; she asked. It was the first spell in their fourth year text, but if Harry hadn't read ahead at all... Hermione suppressed a sigh. &quot;Come up to Gryffindor with me, then, and get some empty Potions vials. Get a handful, just in case. Then meet me back at that classroom.&quot; She pointed to her haven again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Harry agreed easily.<br />
<br />
They both finished their tasks quickly and regrouped in the classroom. Because of Hermione's frequent use, despite the classroom being officially abandoned, it was spotless, and she and Harry quickly emptied their pockets onto the larger professor's desk. Harry had three dinner rolls and four potions vials full of water. Hermione had a mild headache potion and an energy restorative potion, that she had brewed in practice for class this year. Additionally, she had the OWL and NEWT potions books from the library.<br />
<br />
Hermione placed two of the water vials on separate student tables. She poured a drop of the headache potion into the first, a good bit into the second, and then placed the potion itself on the third table.<br />
<br />
Aiming at the third one, she performed the proper jab. &quot;Pepurigoso.&quot; The flask took on a very faint red hue for a second, but it was gone before she could blink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done!&quot; Harry cheered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You saw it, then?&quot; Hermione asked, pleased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Redish, yeah?&quot; Harry agreed.<br />
<br />
Nodding, Hermione took a half step forward and cast again. &quot;Pepurigoso!&quot; she said firmly.<br />
<br />
This time the red hue was distinct, and seemed to ripple inside the flask. When Hermione dropped her wand, the color vanished. She heard pages rustle, and glanced over at Harry. He had picked up the topmost Potions book and was thumbing through it.<br />
<br />
Hermione grabbed the second one and checked the table of contents. Her best bet appeared to be &quot;Reaction, Timing, and Other Tables&quot; on page 493. Turning to it, Hermione thumbed through the section until she found &quot;Detection Tables.&quot; &quot;Got it!&quot; she said happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I did too,&quot; Harry said. Hermione peeked over the edge of his book and found it too labeled detection tables. Looking back at her own, she was pleased to find that it was color coded, and red was even the first section.<br />
<br />
&quot;Red is generally associated with the medical family of potions,&quot; Hermione read the section preface aloud. &quot;The pure red color is associated with denatured dragon bile, which is the base of most healing potions. A burnt orange tone usually indicates the presence of animal venom, which is also common in potions of this family. Red with orange tones is, with very few exceptions, indicative of a healing potion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here's the part on the ripples,&quot; Harry said. &quot;There are seven categories of movement with the standard detection spells: ripples, shimmers, undulations, gradations, pebbling, crystallization, and tremors. There's also a section for multiple colors at a time, with things like speckling, spotting, and striping. It's got little moving examples like wizarding photos.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione glanced at his book and saw what he was talking about. &quot;It looks like we got ripples; you're right. What does it say those mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry cleared his throat and then read, &quot;The seven categories of movement are tied to the seven types of potion activators. These, of course, are animal, human, plant, mineral, crystalline, chemical, and other.&quot; The speed of movement further distinguishes the sub-category of activator. We've got ripples, so that's crystalline. It says... see page 517 for ripple speed...&quot; he leafed ahead. &quot;Here, so it looks like ours was kind of in the middle of the examples, which means it is one of the family of carbonates, hexates, or sul-in-ates?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The headache potion uses powdered hugosilis vert as an activator, and that's a sulinate, so that's probably accurate,&quot; Hermione said.<br />
<br />
Harry looked at her blankly - they hadn't covered this potion in class yet, so he hadn't gotten to the part of the book that talked about crystalline families. &quot;Trust me,&quot; Hermione said, and to her pleased surprise he just nodded and looked back at his book.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's all I've got for starters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well my book explained the red, and as it was red-orange, we know it is likely a medical potion that uses denatured dragon bile and animal venom. And, of course, the headache potion is a medical potion, containing Chinese Opaleye bile and scorpion venom, so I'd say we got a pretty accurate reading.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that could still be dozens of potions, couldn't it?&quot; Harry asked. &quot;How are we supposed to narrow it down if we don't know what we're looking for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione glanced back at her book. &quot;Well, this one has more charts for deciding the exact shade of orange and red, and it lists the most common potions associated with each... oh, here we go! For those who are serious about potion detection and analysis, or those wishing to study antidote creation, detection parchment is needed. There are two varieties: one that cross references color, motion, variegation, and intensity charts and lists all possible results, and a more expensive variety that contains the detection charm in enchantment form and calculates the exact potion placed upon it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So if we really wanted to know what we were finding, we could get the first kind of parchment, and it would narrow it down for us, or the second to do the work for us?&quot; Harry summarized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm sure the second one is hideously expensive,&quot; Hermione hedged. &quot;For now, I think it is most important that we know our food or drink has been tainted, rather than needing to know exactly what is in it, beyond the general.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true,&quot; Harry shrugged. &quot;So in general, we just need to make sure we can do the spells correctly, and ideally silently?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Hermione agreed. &quot;It might be nice to see what the general contents of truth serums are made of, so we could guess if that was in your cup. It also wouldn't hurt to see if the twins tend to use the same base for their prank potions, or if prank potions in general use a common ingredient. Then we could have a general idea if any potion we find is intended maliciously or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Harry agreed. &quot;I could ask them, maybe. Like, 'hey guys, how do you do so well in potions with Snape breathing down your necks? What's in all these anyway?'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is definitely a route we can try,&quot; Hermione agreed. &quot;We should also look up the basic coloring or movement of things that are explicitly dangerous, like poisons, just in case. Not that I think we'll need those, but it never hurts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; Harry nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But there's time for that,&quot; Hermione said. &quot;Now that we know that it works, we need to try it on the diluted vials so that we know how to recognize it in smaller quantities. And we need to practice the food one. Once we're sure we're doing it correctly, and can tell when we've got results, then it is a matter of practicing until we can do it discreetly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry nodded again. &quot;Yeah, sounds like a plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
After an hour of practice, both could cast the spell perfectly, and had mastered chaining them together. Unfortunately, since both of the potions Hermione had brought were healing ones, they didn't have a chance to see different colors, but the restorative used a different activator, so they were able to see what pebbling looked like.<br />
<br />
After an hour, and with Harry needing to do homework, They cleaned up and headed back to the common room. Hermione intended to skim through the reaction tables and see if she could make them a quick cheat list of results to keep handy and eventually memorize.<br />
<br />
They were a few halls shy of the tower when Harry paused. Hermione turned to him expectantly and saw his 'working something out' expression. She had learned over the last few years not to interrupt him in these moments, no matter how much she wanted to help or contribute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Professor Moody said something about curse breakers using these spells, didn't he?&quot; Harry finally said aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;He did,&quot; Hermione agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ron's brother Bill is a curse breaker,&quot; Harry continued. &quot;Ron mentioned that he took an apprenticeship in it, and that he had to study all the time during the first year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Hermione nodded. Ron hadn't mentioned that to her, but she didn't doubt Harry's memory.<br />
<br />
&quot;So it sounds like there are a lot of books on curse breaking, and there might be one that lays out the common reaction combinations or something, instead of you having to cross-reference and make your own list.&quot; Harry concluded.<br />
<br />
This time it was Hermione who stopped dead in the corridor. Harry also stopped and turned to her apprehensively. Finally Hermione found her voice and she flung herself at Harry in a brief hug. &quot;Harry that's brilliant!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er...ehm...&quot; Harry stuttered until Hermione released him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You go start your homework,&quot; she instructed, already taking a few steps in the other direction. &quot;I'll look for curse breaking books in the library and meet you back there!&quot;<br />
<br />
oOo<br />
<br />
Hermione eagerly watched for the mail to be delivered on Wednesday morning. She had been to the library, but there was only one introductory text on curse breaking, and a pamphlet for seventh years considering curse breaking as a career.<br />
<br />
Skimming through the text had proved fruitless, but the career pamphlet had included a list of books that the potential cursebreaker would need to study. One of those was even called Detection Spells and Results for the Curse Breaker. There had been enough time for Hermione to run to the owlery before curfew and send another book order to Flourish and Blotts.<br />
<br />
From experience, she knew that they usually could turn around orders in one to two days, meaning that at least the book on house elves, and possibly the curse breaking book, should arrive today.<br />
<br />
One good thing about her project with Harry to learn detection spells was that it had distracted her fairly well from her questions about house elves.<br />
<br />
Hermione spotted the owl as it neared the Gryffindor House table, and to her delight it appeared to be carrying two books. When the majestic Eagle owl landed, she carefully offered it a piece of bacon, reasoning that if it worked on Hedwig, it should work on any other owl. It greedily chomped at the treat as she untied her package.<br />
<br />
It took only a moment for her to press the knot to unshrink the package, as she had become very familiar with this standard post owl charm. Harry looked excitedly at the package, but Ron didn't seem to have even noticed that she received post.<br />
<br />
&quot;After dinner,&quot; Hermione told him quietly. They did have a free period right before lunch today, but she knew he and Ron would be working on their Potions homework then. That would give her a chance to skim the book on house elves first as well.<br />
<br />
Harry nodded in understanding, and soon it was time for them to head off to Charms.<br />
<br />
oOo<br />
<br />
After Double Potions, followed by Transfiguration that afternoon, Hermione and the boys went down to an early dinner. Hermione still didn't want to advertise that they were looking into detection spells, so she pulled out the elvish book to continue reading. It was actually full of fascinating information, and Hermione was starting to understand why her future self had directed her towards it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that then?&quot; Harry asked after he had gotten a few bites in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elvish Cultures,&quot; Hermione explained, flashing the cover at him. &quot;It was recommended to me to understand more about House Elves,&quot; she explained. She never had to say who recommended it, after all. &quot;It was written by Terrence Hawking, who is a cousin of Stephen Hawking,&quot; she explained, knowing that Harry would understand the reference.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you want to read about house elves?&quot; Ron asked, not bothering to swallow his mouthful of potatoes first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh,&quot; Hermione scowled at him. &quot;I wanted to learn more about them, Ronald. And it turns out that this book covers all kinds of elvish species, not just house elves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are other elves?&quot; Harry perked up. &quot;Like the ones from telly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eager to share her newfound knowledge, Hermione nodded. &quot;Yes, and it is clear that some Muggle authors either aren't as Muggle as we think, or that somehow they met or found out about true elves, because some of their depictions are scarily accurate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, starting with house elves, they appear to be like tiny people, right? Not human exactly, but not an animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Harry nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it turns out that they aren't. This is an example of convergent evolution, where they gained features that are similar to a human's, but they don't descend from the same primate evolutionary tree as us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Ron looked completely baffled, and Hermione assumed that evolution was probably one more thing that wizarding children weren't taught, like literature and maths.<br />
<br />
&quot;So they aren't related to monkeys and such?&quot; Harry looked intrigued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even slightly!&quot; Hermione explained. &quot;They are closer, evolutionarily speaking, to birds, by way of fairies. There is a whole class of animals, including pixies, doxies, and fairies, that evolved from birds and took on what we think of as human-like characteristics. These also created a branch that led to brownies and elves, with house elves being closer to those ancestors than tolkien-esque high elves. And it turns out that veela, like the ones we saw at the Quidditch World Cup, are the only known descendent of this evolutionary branch that has become compatible, in a breeding sense, with humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Harry rocked back. &quot;I hadn't even realized that they weren't basically humans. Like the way that witches and wizards are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They aren't,&quot; Hermione confirmed. &quot;It is our magic that makes us compatible with Veela.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.&quot; Harry thought about that for a few minutes as he turned back to his meal. Hermione returned to her own food and reading as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what else does it say about house elves?&quot; Harry finally asked, a few minutes later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you ever get to symbiosis, parasitism, and mutualism in science?&quot; Hermione asked. She didn't think so - at least not in depth -, since he would have been a year behind her in school, but it was possible.</td>
