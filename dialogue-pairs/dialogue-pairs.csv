one he should have got? I haven't. There's a legend about a man whose
prayers God heard in the matter, so that he was given his first and
only love. But he didn't get much satisfaction out of it. Why not? you
will ask again, and behold, I answer you: for the simple reason that
she died immediately after—immediately after, do you hear? ha-ha-ha,
instantly. So it is always. Naturally one doesn't get the right woman,
but if it happens once in a while out of pure cussedness, then she dies
straight away. There's always some trick in it. So then the man is
reduced to providing himself with another love of the best available
sort and there's no reason why he should die of the change. I tell you,
Nature has ordained it so wisely that he bears it remarkably well. Just
look at me."""

better equipped by Nature. I keep my poems in a drawer. They are to be
published after my death. But then you get no pleasure out of them, you

The only unfortunate side effects were as a result of her dittany allergy.

She'd been reading all day and showed no signs of slowing down or stopping any time soon. ""I'll be back, Mione,"" I said, resting my hand on top of hers briefly to get her attention. I caught a glimpse of our rings as I did so; hers was the same bright purple as it had been since the second we saw Mrs. Norris. I hadn't factored concern into the range of emotions, somehow, but I knew that fear was the closest thing to concern so my half was purple as well.

"A/N: Hi, everyone! I really hoped you enjoyed reading this chapter as much as I enjoyed writing it. I hope you like the lyrics at the beginning, too — I was planning on saving that song for Chapter 48, but I thought it worked here for multiple reasons. First of all, this chapter is a lot more Harry-Lucy-centric than 48 is, and I thought the lines about fighting dragons and ""pretenders"" was particularly appropriate since Draco (which means dragon) was pretending to be a dementor. (I have a stupid sense of humor, I'm sorry, I can't help myself sometimes.)","I did so much research for Lucy's patronus. I read every word I could find describing every single patronus. Here's the explanation for the bear patronus, and I hope you all see why I went with the bear in the end: ""The bear is indicative of someone with a great reserve of patience and inner strength. Bears do often well in leadership roles, though are more than content alone, happily spending their time in reflection and contemplation. They are confident, stable people that others may gravitate to in trying times for stability and healing. Though their quiet nature and tendency to spend time away from the crowd can lead to others thinking they are stern or anti-social, bears are often friendly and curious, and can surprise even those that know them best with something they didn’t think of. Brown bears are known to be the 'warriors' of the bear archetype, standing their ground and facing danger to protect others or do what they believe is right, not backing down no matter the danger."""

Why could some wizarding family not have taken you in? Many would have done so more than gladly, would have been honored and delighted to raise you as a son. My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but myself realized. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters — and many of them are almost as terrible as he — were still at large, angry, desperate, and violent. And I had to make my decision too with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone forever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty, or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you. I knew that Voldemort's knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power. But I knew too where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated — to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day.

We had a real Golden Snitch, and real goal hoops, and, for an extra challenge, two Quaffles.","Two Chasers, one Seeker, one Keeper per team. Harry insisted upon breaking ""both sets of twins"" up — he claimed Lucy, Henry, and George for his team, meaning I was on a team with Fred, Ron, and Angelina. Ron volunteered for Seeker and Angelina said she wanted to give Keeper a try, meaning Fred and I were the Chasers.

Otto and Ludo have been doing favors for each other for quite a long time, as they discovered when they investigated why Ludo was so willing to offer something as generous as Top Box Quidditch World Cup tickets to the person that helped Otto out of trouble. Anyway, back to my story. Ludo took the Felix Felicis, played his best match ever, and reaped the rewards. A couple of people were suspicious of just how stellar Ludo's performance was, so he retired before anyone could look too closely at it. He got addicted to gambling after that wild first success, but soon learned that gambling successfully was much harder when you couldn't just take Felix Felicis and win by default — not that he didn't try. He blew his Quidditch fortune on Felix Felicis, buying more and more of it when the stakes were higher and higher, disproportionate to the actual stakes because he was so paranoid, until he was broke and had to resort to, as you already know, fake money and loopholes. All this to say, Ludo Bagman is a terrible example, if you're trying to prove your point that men are historically better Beaters, because one-third of his statistical success was earned with Felix Felicis. Maybe it's true that he didn't need liquid luck to perform that well in that match, but we'll never know, will we?""","""But if you look back hundreds of years at who the most successful Beaters have been — """
"""Okay,"" he said, nodding. ","I offered Dennis a smile before turning to Cormac and dropping the smile. ""As for you, Cormac, I'd appreciate it if you stopped interfering with the team. You are only playing in this match at all because Ron was accidentally poisoned. Ginny and I are perfectly capable and competent Beaters. If you really think men who play Beater are better than women who play Beater, it might comfort you to know that Ginny and I were trained by Fred and George Weasley. You shouldn't think that, though, because, historically, Ginny and I have proven ourselves to be the better Beaters. If you've actually been paying attention to the Gryffindor Quidditch matches the past few years, surely you would realize that nobody on the team has gotten injured when Ginny and I have bats in our hands, and the same can't be said for the matches where Fred and George were the Beaters.

I knew that she had to be so brave to face whatever she was experiencing wherever she was, so she taught me bravery too. Ambition was how I distracted myself from the depths of my anxiety and my grief, because when I was devoting myself to the pursuit of a goal, whether it was academic or athletic or relational, there wasn't much room to wonder where Lucy was and when she'd be coming back to us, to me. Wit was how I learned to live rather than just survive, because it was my wit that made people laugh, and it was people's laughter that made me feel most fulfilled. I couldn't quite place my finger on what exactly my mom meant by saying I was ""relentlessly compassionate.""

Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes: He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form.

However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the intention of killing you. He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemort's mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth."""

Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master's soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence — but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley's daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke.

Well, my side of it is this: It was supposed to just be a typical full moon, about a week before Christmas our fifth year. Our routine at that point was for Sirius and Peter to go into the Shrieking Shack with me while I transformed, while Cass and James waited outside. Cass was a horse and James was a deer, so it would have been a bit of a tight squeeze with all five of us — well, you know that, sorry, you've been there. Anyway, Sirius was running late, which was unusual but not too much of a cause for concern, because he was, well, Sirius. What was unusual was that we noticed someone following us down to the Whomping Willow, and that someone was Snape. From what little I saw and heard in the seconds before I transformed, Cass tried to stop him, but he hexed her out of the way, so James had to tackle him to stop him from following me. Once I had transformed, I obviously didn't remember or care about any of that. A deer and a rat kept the wolf company in the Shrieking Shack that night, and James and Peter told me about what happened on our way to the Hospital Wing. They didn't have the whole story yet, so all they were able to tell me was that Sirius told Snape to go down there, and I was — understandably, I believe — furious and hurt."""
"I winced. ""Oh, damn.""","""Yeah. Anyway, Cass never told me I had to forgive him right away, but she — she specifically told me to forgive him before it was too late. I didn't know what she meant at the time, and I didn't care, but I never did trust him again, not until that night in the Shrieking Shack when Ron's rat turned into Peter Pettigrew once more. I was wrong, I did love Sirius again, and we were together again even before he went to Azkaban, but it was never the same. I let my resentment divide us, I didn't give him chances to build that trust back, I didn't let myself really forgive him."""

Rowena didn't want to die without seeing her daughters again, or at least her eldest daughter, so she sent someone to fetch her.

Apparently a couple people suspect Helga Hufflepuff had a role in its disappearance, since she was the only one caring for Rowena Ravenclaw at the end of her life, but that seems silly to me. Hufflepuff House was founded on the idea of hard work and loyalty, and stealing your best friend's diadem that supposedly magically enhances your wisdom seems rather contradictory, don't you think?""","Hermione nodded after a moment. ""Yes. Tell us more about the dark magic, though, that's how this story started."""
"""So this magic theoretically protects against, say, unnatural deaths?"" Hermione asked.","""Yeah, I think so. Like it shields you from being murdered, and possibly from fates such as accidents as well. As far as I can tell, when performed successfully, Helga Hufflepuff's magic protects against all deaths except for natural ones, like illness or old age. I have no idea how any of it is done, though, because again, the book didn't go into detail for obvious reasons. It sounds dark. Not nearly as dark as Horcruxes, but, well, think about the other magical ways to prolong life. The Philosopher's Stone created a plethora of problems, for Nicolas Flamel and for many other people. Drinking unicorn blood curses you to a half-life.

I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk, but 'For the Greater Good' became Grindelwald's slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he committed later. And... from that... it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea. They say 'For the Greater Good' was even carved over the entrance to Nurmengard, the prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents. He ended up in there himself, once Dumbledore had caught him. Anyway, it's — it's an awful thought that Dumbledore's ideas helped Grindelwald rise to power. But on the other hand, even Rita can't pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one summer when they were both really young, and — """
